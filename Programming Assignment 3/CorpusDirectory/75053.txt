She shares their stories through this series of images that , for her , represent the beauty , strength , diversity and absolute resilience of Australian women . In her own words , Lisa reveals why she is captivated by storytelling through photography and why she chose to photograph Asher Keddie , Deborra-Lee Furness , Dame Marie Bashir , Peta Credlin , Turia Pitt , Evonne Goolagong Cawley , Cate McGregor , Gretel Packer , Mia Freedman and Dr. Susan Carland for this powerful and personal exhibition . <p> I know that their unique stories will speak to all Australians , no matter their circumstances . <p> I have always loved the power of a photograph . It is quite abstract as an art form and there are kind of no rules . I remember the first moment ( in New York ) where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent years now telling photographers what I want to see when they go out and shoot for me , so I should have a good idea of what I want to see " . <p> Being able to experiment with photography is such an exercise in creativity . <p> Making mistakes and then fixing them , learning what works and the experimentation process in photography is something that I adore . Its been a privilege to be able to mix that with women who I feel incredibly humble to be around . I loved hearing their stories and what motivates them and what their life is like . The biggest challenge was getting over my nerves and believing that this was happening but I worked with such a great team from Canon who were so generous in their advice . <p> I 've been so incredibly fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by amazing women <p> Sharing their incredible stories through this exhibition in many ways feels a natural extension of everything that I 've done in my career so far . To be able to capture all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To discover what their life is like outside of the public eye is an incredible opportunity . <p> I love their honesty , I love their authenticity and I love that the real common denominator amongst all these women is this inner beauty that you ca n't manufacture . It 's about being inside themselves and being true to what they believe in and what they 're passionate about . In many ways its about not really caring what the rest of the world thinks , because they have these burning beliefs that allow them to live their lives with grace and passion and integrity . <p> I loved talking to them , I loved hearing their stories and I loved learning what motivates them . <p> I also enjoy and I think it 's a very human thing to talk to somebody about their vulnerabilities and realised that so often people , especially as women in the public eye , that you have to show a certain strength . Just to talk to these women , under any circumstances , I 'll always be up for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph is magic . <p> These women to me are perfect because of their differences . <p> I love that they are so diverse and of different ages , different experiences and different belief systems . I wanted to convey that diversity , and not just in the way they look , but in what they have to offer us . All of them are incredibly humble and were amazed when I contacted them to be a part of this . I 'm so thrilled that they were able to trust me . I think all of them had such a strong sense of themselves , but they also have a beautiful humility and honesty about who they are , and I hope that 's come through in these photographs . 
@@14685627 @3285627/ <h> What is the rule of thirds ? <h> The Basics : <p> This is one of the best known principles or techniques for composition in photography and acts as a guideline for how an image should be composed for the most aesthetically pleasing result . <h> A Little More Detail : <p> With the rule of thirds , the frame is divided into nine equal parts by mentally drawing two lines vertically and two lines horizontally across it . The rule dictates that the focal points or important parts within the scene of your image should be placed in line with these mentally-drawn lines or at the intersections of the grid . 
@@14685629 @3285629/ <h> What is Depth of Field ? <h> The Basics : <p> Depth of Field ( DoF ) is the range in front or behind the point of focus where objects remain sharp and in focus . The wider the aperture ( lower f-number ) , the shallower the DoF . As such , depth of field plays a crucial part in the look and feel of an image . <p> Other factors than can affect the depth of field are lens focal length , distance between camera and subject . 
@@14685630 @3285630/ <h> What is Angle of View ? <h> The Basics : <p> The Angle of View refers to the maximum angle that a lens can see , based on a combination of focal length and camera sensor . <h> A Little More Detail : <p> Lenses with a higher focal length - let 's say 100mm - are able to hone in on things further away ; but they also have a narrower angle of view . By comparison , shorter focal lengths , such as a fisheye lens , have a much wider angle of view .

To achieve maximum return on investment , businesses need to go beyond the basics . <p> Whether you 're a digital native or technology dinosaur , one thing is clear digital transformation is not just a passing trend . IDC predicts that digital transformation will form the core of most Global 2000 company strategies within a year . A third of businesses say digital will drive 15 per cent of their growth by 2017 . <p> Many businesses have already taken steps towards digital transformation . Almost half ( 48 per cent ) of executives surveyed in a YouGov study said they had started their digital transformation journey . <p> In the early phases , these workplaces typically focus on reducing paper use and moving document storage online .

While the integrity of transaction-focused systems with sensitive data must be protected , IT needs to provide nimble customer-facing capabilities . " <p> Todays employees perform best in agile work environments . They expect to interact with documents across integrated , mobile-friendly systems . They have little patience for inefficient manual processes with limited tracking capabilities . And they do n't  want to waste time navigating outdated legacy systems . <p> The only way to meet these expectations is by reaching a higher level of digital transformation .

Instead of wrangling multiple devices and systems , workers can capture and print documents and access cloud applications from a smartphone or PC . <p> " In the past , productivity often required the user to adapt to technology .

The biggest challenge is working out where to point your camera . <p> If there is one word I like to emphasise , it is ' simplicity ' learning how to get a photograph to tell a single story to communicate with our viewer .

For some reason he was grinning ear-to-ear as he drove , playing the worst Swahili elevator music mix Ive ever heard .

Hougaard followed behind us but at a distance , knowing that with a good start he could outrun us both if the beast got a little feisty . Measuring distance in the desert is hard : something that looks roughly 500 metres away is more likely one kilometre off . So after about two kilometres of walking , we finally managed to get close enough to shoot . <p> Emma stayed back near the car . I think she was secretly hoping shed get that award-winning Nat Geo shot of two photographers getting chasedand run overby an Oryx .

The dunes around us came alive , and lit up like they were on fire . <p> The swirling sand took on the appearance of the cruelest of bushfires , with flames reaching hundreds of meters into the air . <p> There were four of us shooting the same image that morning , but we all managed to capture different pictures as the sands shape and form was so random it was impossible to shoot anything identical .

@@14685709 @3285709/ <h> 6 Tips to Help You Nail Fireworks Photography <p> 27th December 2016 , 09:00am <h> Getting started : <h> 1 . Find the right vantage point <p> Consider your position carefully , and find somewhere that takes advantage of your background . Think about introducing some foreground , or you could stand 500 meters away from the action and use a telephoto lens to create great depth compression . Consider the practicality of using a tripod in a crowd . Although you need it to do long exposures , it may become a frustrating experience if there 's a good chance of it being bumped . Where you choose to set up is crucial . <h> 2 . Focusing is your friend <p> Once you 're setup in your chosen position , grab your camera and switch on single autofocus ( preferably select the centre point ) . Point the camera at an object in a distance greater than 20 metres away and auto-focus on that object ( take a test shot to check the sharpness ) . Lock the lens on manual focus ( be careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attach it to the tripod . Now your lens is setup to infinity focus and will grab those fireworks , crisply and cleanly . If you have an issue mid-show : turn autofocus back on ; shoot a distant well-lit object ; and repeat . <h> 3 . Timing is everything <p> Consider the length of time you 're going to set for your exposure . Shooting at a standard 1/125th " is not going to give that WOW factor , you really need to begin at 2 " minimum . <p> Lock your camera focus down on its tripod , point it in the right direction and zoom in to gain the desired composition . Next , set the camera to full manual and set your ISO to 400 . An aperture of f4 with a 2 " exposure is a good starting point . <p> *Tip*- Remote triggers are worth the cost ! Bumping your tripod by pressing the button manually will ruin a good firework shot . If you have one , keep your finger on the button and action the frame as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relying on a 2 second timer , you will need to hit the button as the mortar ' thumps ' when the firework leaves the tube . <h> Pushing the boundaries with more advanced techniques : <h> 1 . Playing Around with Shutter Speed <p> Once you 've nailed a few 2 " shots , try changing your shutter speed to 0.8th " , lower your ISO to 100 and keep your aperture at f4 . This will give you the same exposure and allow for 0.8 " worth of action to be captured , creating a busier scene in your image . <p> If you want to push the envelope a little further , try a full 30 " . Keep your ISO at 100 and lift your aperture to f8 . This will give you the same exposure , but allows for 30 generous seconds of fireworks to be captured in one frame . <p> From these 3 setups you can choose which is the most suited to your particular fireworks display . <h> 2 . Getting Creative with Zooming <p> Experiment by zooming in or out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot with the settings above , release the shutter and begin the frame with a firework explosion . While the camera is exposing within those 2 seconds , turn your zoom ring on the lens and watch what happens . <h> 3 . Multiple Exposures <p> Jump into the multiple exposure setting of your camera ; select additive mode and at least three frames . Keep your 2 " settings mentioned above , click the shutter three times in a row and the camera will compile all three exposures into one frame . <p> If you do n't have this setting on your camera , select bulb mode , f.4 and ISO 100 . Hold down the button on your remote release and a piece of black cardboard in your other hand positioned in front of the lens blocking light , then simply move the cardboard to the side each time there is a nice firework explosion .

The brief is set by the client or ad agency and I make it happen . I turn to my Speedlites , my brollys and stands and my EOS 1DX for virtually every shoot . This procedure works perfectly well and business is good . <p> But sometimes you find yourself falling into patterns and adopting the same tried and trusted techniques , achieving very similar results , which of course is what the client wants and what pays the bills . <p> I 'm running a busy commercial operation so when the jobs are flooding in its easy to push personal projects aside . I tend to take the work that pays the mortgage and keeps food on the table . However , life would get boring if you followed the same paths everyday and I firmly believe you have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Plenty of yesterdays hot-shot photographers are today 's forgotten dinosaurs . So I set myself the challenge of working with some new gear ; A EOS 5Ds body , some tiny LED lights and walking a new path where the route was n't set and the outcome unknown . <p> I did n't  have a brief , the images were led as much by the subject as the photographer and it all made for a refreshing change . My project evolved into the series of shots you see before you now . <p> I had been experimenting with LED lighting and particularly liked the way they could be hidden from view to light areas where a flash couldnt . Having progressed through numerous torches and lamps , I sourced a set of tiny LED flat panels that ran off a 12 volt battery and could be squirreled away into the smallest of species . For instance , a child 's hand ! <p> All the kids in the project I know well and this helped me immensely in gaining their trust and relaxing them for the shoot . You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while I often had a planned shot in mind , the results were rarely as intended and are usually better . <p> It was often the childs own choice of costume or sitting position that brought the magic to the photograph . <p> As much as an exercise in lighting , the project was also an opportunity to experiment with my newly acquired EOS 5Ds . The rich blacks and astounding resolution were both a departure from my previous Canon bodies . This was a good way to learn the capabilities and get a feel for the camera , whilst not in the pressure pot of a full commercial shoot .

Here he reflects upon his career and reveals how he captured classic shots of two Australian leaders one on the verge of retirement from an illustrious sports career and the other in the ascension to the most important job in the country . <p> You can not stop learning this profession , and I guess composition is a really big thing to me , and I think if you can start to work that out , you can become a good photographer . <h> On getting into photography <p> I was pretty lucky . I got into photography at a young age . I was about 12 or 13 and a family friend who was a historian had written a book about the history of the South Australian National Football League . I was flicking through it and saw it had a lot of these black and white photographs in it , and I asked him : " Where did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd taken a lot of them himself . My response was : " Oh , what a great job . Sit on the sidelines and shoot the footy . " I just went from there and decided straightaway that 's what I 'd do . <p> I definitely love that I start with nothing . There 's nothing there , and it 's up to me to go out and find a picture and produce something with good feeling and good composition . That is really important to me . <p> I think it was about 1996 when I moved across to Canon . Growing up , my dad had a Canon T70 , which was probably the first camera I picked up . My dad probably wo n't like me saying this , but I do remember while camping once that I picked up the camera and I was trying to work out this split image focus thing and he said something like : " Mate , if you ca n't work that out , you 're not going to be able to do it . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll find out a way to do it , " and I guess I worked it out . But dad has been such a great support throughout my career and showed me what you can achieve by having a great work ethic . <h> On recreating history with Steve Waugh <p> I love sport and was lucky that I had a very good photography teacher at school . As such , most of my career has been sport and its something of a tradition for me to photograph the Australian cricket captain in a portrait setting . <p> &lt;p " &gt;This shot of Steve Waughs retirement from test cricket and the Australian captaincy is one of my most iconic , but at time of the photo shoot , I had no idea of its significance . Merely hours after I captured that photo of Steve he announced his retirement and suddenly that image became the front page on papers around the country . &lt;/p " &gt; <p> Twelve years later , as a Canon Master I was thrilled to return to the SCG with Steve and a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the team around the world . What people did n't realise was that after the talk we were going down to the home dressing shed to recreate Steve 's retirement portrait . It was an amazing experience and one that I loved sharing to inspire other photographers . <h> On that Julia Gillard shot <p> I got thrown in the deep end when Julia Gillard toppled Kevin Rudd for leadership . I was asked to go to Canberra and spend a week following her around . My editor had allowed me to do the series in black and white and to be a fly on the wall for a few days . I remember walking out of a room and 10 minutes later when Julia walked out , I just hit her with a flash of the camera . I do n't think she was expecting that but she saw my passion for the assignment and as such , pictures started to happen . <p> I went back later just before the election was happening , and I desperately wanted to try get a picture of her in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shot was taken it was after midnight .

And I said : " Prime Minister , I am sorry , but I 'm not photographing you in the bath " . And she said : " No , you 're not ! " <p> I put all my energy in to trying to achieve that image . Finding your passion and working hard at it has been my law , I guess .

" You can not outrun the blinding speed of digital disruption .

There 's the importance of network acceleration how , thanks to the power of internet-enabled and mobile technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big companies " . But equally important is what he terms " ultra outcomes " , where big businesses shift from selling the technology to selling the outcome . " Why is Google now in the business of cars ? Because it answered a mechanical problem with an information solution . " <p> Innovation leads to disruption <p> Riddell points out that the simplest of ideas can disrupt everything . He praises his favourite business : the taxi and ridesharing force , Uber . The company showed the taxi industry , globally , that a lack of innovation and a lack of customer focus makes you a big target . " If you do n't  innovate and adapt , you will be disrupted . " <p> Earlier , in a panel discussion at the Future of Work conference , Simon Rossi , GM at Uber Technologies Australia , noted the companys customer-centric philosophy .

@@14685764 @3285764/ <h> Virtual reality : The future of your business or just a game ? <p> 22nd October 2015 , 09:24pm <h> With virtual reality becoming an actual reality in the near future , what potential applications could it have for Australian businesses and consumers ? <p> The technology portrayed in movies such as The Lawnmower Man and Brainstorm has promised to become reality for decades , and its almost here . While both movies received the Hollywood treatment , the technology portrayed was based on reality . <p> A totally immersive environment using helmets or goggles , headphones and a haptic feedback suit were all possible , or nearly possible , in the early 1990s . The problem was that rendering it realistically needed a supercomputer or two networked over high-bandwidth connections . <p> Is that a supercomputer in your pocket ? <p> Hardware has now caught up with the VR vision and modern desktops and laptops are powerful beyond the dreams of 1990s software developers . Indeed , most of us now carry the equivalent of a 1990s supercomputer in our pocket or handbag with our smartphones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is available now for a price ; but what really promises to be a game changer is the advent of relatively inexpensive VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift , the developer kit which costs around US$900 , and the Samsung smartphone-based Gear VR , which costs around US$300 . <p> Virtual reality is nearly here <p> The Oculus Rift virtual reailty headset is the most promising device of its type that has been seen in years . People who have tested it say it envelops users in a all-encompassing environment reminiscent of the holodeck from Star Trek Next Generation . <p> The company , Oculus VR , got started with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign which enabled it to show prototypes at various consumer electronics shows in 2013 . Cashflow issues evaporated when Oculus VR was bought by Facebook and its ground-breaking Rift is now due to be released in 2016 with pre-orders being taken from late 2015 . <p> The Rift has two individual OLED displays with a resolution of 1080+1200 per eye , a wide field of view and a 90Hz refresh rate . It promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will need to be connected via cable to a fairly powerful gaming PC . <p> The Rift has positional tracking via a separate IR sensor situated on the users desk , which enables the Rift to provide spatialised audio through the integrated headphones . <p> Although tethered by a cable , the spatial awareness allows users to use the Rift sitting , standing or walking around the room . The addition of Oculus Touch controllers , due for release several months after the Rift becomes available , makes the users hands part of the position-tracked space , giving the sensation of their hands interacting with the virtual world . <p> A fully developed ecosystem <p> Not long after it exhibited early prototypes , Oculus VR made developer kits available for software developers to develop applications and content with the intention that the Rift is just one part of a fully developed ecosystem at launch . <p> According to the company , a number of game developers have already ported existing games while others are working on games designed specifically for the Rift . Oculus Cinema is a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the virtual environment . <p> While Oculus VR has stated its focus is on gaming , some of the other applications the technology can be used for are obvious . Instead of expensive telepresence suites , geographically distributed teams could hold virtual business meetings or even meet clients overseas in a virtual space . <p> The Rift could be used to train people in a variety of skills using a host of lifelike , role-playing scenarios . Architects are already using VR to walk clients through virtual buildings , and its not a big step to provide someone with the virtual experience of their new kitchen or a new car . <p> Military has been leading the charge <p> The idea of creating a virtualised space for training is not new . The first flight simulators were developed in World War I and in subsequent years armed forces have been early adopters of VR technology . <p> Flight simulators have become ever more complex and many modern navies have ship simulators . Its not surprising that the Norwegian army is just one military publicly admitting its already using VR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other special forces , VR offers faster and cheaper ways to train operatives . Typically , before a unit conducts an operation such as a raid on a building an expensive mock-up of the site will be built for the unit to practice going through all the steps of the raid . VR offers the ability to do this much more cheaply and quickly . <p> Do n't  forget entertainment <p> While there are any number of industrial and military uses for VR , consumer uptake will be driven by entertainment . <p> Video games and movies will become truly immersive experiences , as will more cultural pursuits such as virtual reality tours of art galleries and recreations of important archaeological site . Being able to view the videos of a concert , theatre or dance performance in VR also promises to be an engaging experience . <p> The opportunities are there for Australian businesses all it takes is imagination . 
@@14685765 @3285765/ <h> Painting with light : the biplane below the ocean <p> 29th September 2016 , 03:56pm <p> The silent deep waters of Rabual Harbour in Papua New Guinea became a graveyard of twisted metal during its occupation by the Japanese forces during World War II . These haunting wrecks have lured marine photographers for decades . It so enthralled Canon Master and Tales by Light season one storyteller Darren Jew that his passion to capture a 70-year old Mitsubishi biplane named Pete created an ethereal image that reveals how an old machine built for death and destruction became home to corals and vertebrates that continue to support life . <p> Any dive you do is full of anticipation but diving on a site that you 've longed to dive , it just heightens that excitement that much more . <p> Ever since I was as boy dreaming of destinations around the world , Rabaul was always high on my list of places to go . One of the wrecks that really caught my imagination was a Mitsubishi biplane that the Allied forces code named Pete . I just knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just get these things in your mind from time to time and you envisage the image you want to create . <p> The plan was to photograph it at night using a long exposure created by opening up the shutter for an extended period of time and letting in a lot of light . Long exposure is often used in low light conditions for landscapes or the night sky and these photographs can be enhanced by bringing in an external light source a technique called painting with light . <p> The most challenging images are always the most satisfying , and to create this picture over so many days was just the most amazing experience . <p> Our first night dive on Petes biplane was the result of a combination of planning , negotiation , and practice all of that work to create this one very special moment . And we had 20 minutes and 27 metres to achieve it . As I floated above the wreck and looked at the details through the beam of the torch , I was amazed by the colour and the amount of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was visualising and building the picture as I swam . After 70 years on the ocean floor it was so incredibly intact and everyone was blown away by how beautiful this biplane still was . <p> About Darren Jew is one of the worlds leading marine photographers . He has forged an impressive career having shot for the likes of Tourism Australia , WWF ( World Wildlife Fund ) and the CSIRO . His knowledge of the ocean and its creatures coupled with his adventurous spirit , makes a brilliant subject to document .

@@14685784 @3285784/ <h> Shooting with Auto Focus Produces Blurred Shots <h> Solution <h> Images come out blurred <p> Most cameras now come equipped with a convenient auto focus ( AF ) functionality which allows the camera to automatically focus on subjects without any manual focus adjustment being necessary . <p> It is a limitation of auto focus that some focus points may appear to shift when a picture is taken . <p> The AF focus accuracy of Canon Digital Single-Lens Reflex Cameras and Interchangeable-Lens Compact System Cameras is based on the principle that when a captured image is completely printed out and viewed at a distance appropriate to the print size , viewing it should be the same as viewing a photograph taken by a film camera . <p> However , when using digital cameras , it is easy to magnify or print out just a part of the image after it has been downloaded to your computer . Not printing the complete picture taken can magnify small errors in auto focus that would otherwise not be apparent when being viewed at a more traditional print size . <h> Tips for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below are a few tips to help you take sharp images : <p> 1 . Remember that AF may fail to focus on certain subjects in such cases you are advised to focus on a different point of the subject ( eg. an area with greater contrast ) or to use manual focus ( MF ) adjustment instead please refer to your product user manual for full instructions on how to use manual focus . <p> 2 . Take advantage of a deeper depth of field . <p> " Depth of field " is the range where acceptable focus is achieved in front of and behind the point of focus . The depth of field is changed by both the aperture and focal length of the lens . Using a deeper depth of field will help avoid getting images that are out of focus . <p> Keeping the aperture down ( smaller aperture ) makes the depth of field deeper . <p> If you use a zoom lens , move the zoom control towards wide-angle ( shorter focal length ) in order to get a deeper depth of field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If the camera shakes when shooting it may result in blurred images . Sometimes this may look like a focus problem when it is actually due to shaking the camera during shooting . For tips on preventing camera shake , see the following . <p> After shooting , it is possible to correct the sharpness and contrast of the image taken by using retouching software such as Adobe Photoshop Elements on your computer .

Along with creativity , imagination is the currency of success for us all , and it 's something we have from birth . When we 're tiny humans we visualise creatures in the clouds , draw dreamt-up lands and characters , and act out scenes from exciting fantasies . Many think imagination ends with childhood , a cruel blow that many of us never recover from . But what happens when we lose it- do we really lose it ? <p> Imagination does not breed insanity . Exactly what does breed insanity is reason . <p> G. K. Chesterton <p> What happens is kids go through various stages of development and they experience " magical thinking " . They do n't really understand the world , or science . They do n't understand things like gravity , so they make up stories to explain things in the world , " Dr Guaran explains . <p> " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up stories . Imaginative play or creative play is an important component of all childhood . It peaks at nine or ten years of age . Then you go through adolescence , where you have an idea that you 're immortal , and all powerful- this is especially true for men . So we do n't really lose our imagination , it just changes . " <p> What is the price of this change ? As a child , it 's a huge compliment to be told , " You have a very active imagination . " As an adult , that phrase quickly morphs into an insult , especially when used in the middle of a conversation about relationships , accusations of love affairs or lofty thoughts of self-importance . <p> Poets do not go mad ; chess players do . Mathematicians go mad , and cashiers ; but creative artists very seldom . I am not , as will be seen , in any sense attacking logic : I only say that this danger does lie in logic , not in imagination . <p> by G. K Chesterton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brainiest of us- scientists- tap into their imagination . <p> " A scientist can show us how imaginative adults can be . They see a problem and use their imagination to come up with a solution : it might be the atomic bomb , or it might be medication that can cure a disease , " Dr Guaran says .. <p> " So what they are doing is taking all the knowledge they 've got and say , ' Ok , with all this knowledge , what 's the next step ' They take their knowledge and they use their imagination to produce something extraordinary . " <p> Our imagination never really leaves us . Even if we try to pretend we 've outgrown our creativity , our imagination is right there waiting for us , like a long-lost friend .

Correct exposure refers to optimal exposure for a subject , whereas underexposure is insufficient exposure and overexposure is excessive exposure . <h> Setting Exposure Compensation <p> If the mode dial of this camera is set to a mode other than &lt; M &gt; , the camera automatically sets the appropriate exposure value . If you want to adjust the exposure value that is set by the camera , you can use the exposure compensation setting . <p> Exposure compensation can increase ( brighter ) or decrease ( darker ) the standard exposure set by the camera . You can adjust the value if the mode dial is set to &lt; P &gt; , &lt; Tv &gt; , or &lt; Av &gt; . <p> NOTE <p> The range of exposure compensation <p> The compensable range is within 5 stops in 1/3-stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of light doubles or halves .

Other legal factors to take into consideration include differing intellectual property laws , judicial systems and company bankruptcy rules across the two countries . <p> Companies should develop a contract for any offshore outsourcing agreements , specifying the work to be undertaken , schedules and deadlines for projects , and quality guarantees to measure performance . Additionally , taking the time to select an appropriate vendor for projects and setting out a dispute-resolution procedure should it be needed is essential to avoid any legal issues . <p> Social and cultural factors <p> Companies can come up against social and cultural barriers when offshoring a business function to a foreign country , which can greatly affect the long-term success of a project or business unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with different approaches to completing tasks , varying attitudes toward conflict and also diverse decision-making styles . Cultural issues can also increase significantly after businesses have established an offshore centre and moved into a rapid-growth phase of scaling up employee numbers . <p> As the business function grows and more staff with less experience in Australian or multinational companies come on board , miscommunication can begin to seep in . However , companies can overcome this by engaging outside expertise to carry out an assessment of cultural working differences that could impede team effectiveness . Cross-cultural awareness training is also a good option for companies to educate all levels of management and across the workforce . <p> Technological considerations <p> Many businesses offshore business functions in IT and administration to save money and access lower labour costs .

This type of software could also help businesses cut back certain business functions across administration entirely , which would also negate a move offshore . <p> Do your homework and make sure you take into account any legal , cultural or technological considerations before making the move offshore .

@@14685883 @3285883/ <h> What is aperture ? <h> The Basics : <p> An Aperture is the opening within a lens that controls how much light hits the imaging sensor . Think of it as the pupil in your eye . <p> The size of the aperture will dictate two things ; firstly , your depth of field and secondly , the shutter speed required to expose the image correctly . Adjusting your Aperture settings will therefore play a huge part in the look and feel of the image . <h> A Little More Detail : <p> In photography , the size of the Aperture is expressed in F numbers , for example : <p> F/1.4 , F/2.0 , F/2.8 , F/4.0 , F/5.6 , F/8.0 , F/11.0 , F/16 <p> On the face of it , F numbers seem like quite a random sequence of numbers , but actually represent the diameter of the Aperture as a ratio to the focal length of the lens . Therefore , the smaller the number , the larger the Aperture , and of course the larger the Aperture , the greater the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shutter speeds , F numbers are listed as stops which have a halving or doubling relationship to each adjacent number . For example , F/2.8 let 's in twice the amount of light as F/4.0 , but only half as much as F/2.0 . This of course has a critical effect on exposure ; if you stop down from F/2.8 to F/4.0 , you will need to keep your shutter open for twice as long , in order to let in the right amount of light . <p> So why would you adjust your Aperture speed ? Broadly , there are two reasons why you might adjust your Aperture . <p> Firstly , you might change your Aperture to adjust your depth of field , ie the amount of the image which appears in focus . This of course will play a huge part in how your image turns out . For example , portrait shots tend to be captured with a large Aperture , which will blur the background , making the face stand out more . Likewise , a landscape shot might be captured with a small Aperture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember the relationship between F number and depth of field , think of a small F number ( ie , a larger Aperture ) as giving you a small or shallow depth of field . Likewise , think of a large F number ( ie , a smaller aperture ) as giving you a larger depth of field . <p> Secondly , you might be shooting in low light , and want to use as large an Aperture as possible , so that you can use a fast shutter speed , thus avoiding camera shake blur . The larger the aperture a lens is capable of being set to , the faster the shutter speed you can use this is why youll often hear a lens referred to as being fast . That is to say , typically , large aperture lenses are more expensive than smaller aperture lenses , as it is technically more complex to create a large aperture lens . <p> So how do you know what Aperture a lens is capable of being set to ? This information is always found in the naming convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lens itself . For example , the EF 85mm F1.2L II USM can be set to a maximum of F/1.2 . A zoom lens will often support a different maximum Aperture , depending on the focal length .

Sampson , from the Optical+Biomedical Engineering Laboratory , The University of Western Australia <p> A novel optical imaging device has been developed that can improve our ability to image cancer with microscopic resolution while it is within the body . At the core of the imaging device lies standard optical fibre , together with very small lenses and mirrors fused together and installed in the shaft of a hollow hypodermic needle . We have developed imaging needles with diameters as small as 330 ++m . Using this technology , optical imaging can be performed wherever a needle can be inserted . In particular , we are using our needles to assess cancer boundaries during surgery . <p> An image of the author 's finger holding the needle probe . E is epithelium , D is dermis , and S is a sweat gland . <p> Paul Stewart , with supervisor Dr. Peter Tuthill from The University of Sydney . <p> This project achieves ultra-high resolution imaging of stars using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique employing stellar occultations made by the planetary rings of Saturn . A stellar occultation occurs when a star passes behind a foreground object , with the important occulter here being Saturn 's ring system as viewed from the vantage point of NASA 's CASSINI spacecraft in its orbit around Saturn . It was first suggested more than 100 years ago by Eddington that the detailed behaviour of the shadow cast by such an edge can reveal the structure of the light source . The wave nature of light produces a characteristic diffraction pattern , and careful study of occultations where the Earth 's moon passes in front of a star have historically been used to produce a one-dimensional brightness profile of the celestial target . <p> Using CASSINI 's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer ( VIMS ) instrument , I obtained occultations across the near infrared waveband ( 1-5m ) simultaneously , enabling me to measure the sizes and shapes of stars together with their environments as a function of observing wavelength . Strong wavelength-dependent behaviour of the stellar properties was revealed , pointing to the existence of molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . <p> When the sightline to a star passes behind Saturn 's ring plane , it encounters occultation events at a variety of different ring locations . By combining the one dimensional reconstructions obtained from each event , which all occur at different angles , I have been able to employ tomographic techniques similar to those found in medical imaging to reconstruct unique new high resolution two-dimensional images . This effectively enables the rings of Saturn to be used as a giant telescope which can be used to study the stars . <p> Charles Baker from The University of Queensland , with supervisors Dr. Nicholas Dowson , Dr. Paul Thomas and Professor Steven Rose , from The Australian eHealth Research Centre , CSIRO . <p> Positron emission tomography ( PET ) is an imaging modality used to elucidate the metabolic functioning of tissue .

@@14685942 @3285942/ <h> Automate finance for efficiency gains in 2017 <p> 21st February 2017 , 04:30pm <p> A new wave of robotisation is driving innovation in finance and accounting , an industry that before automation was characterised by increasingly complex operations carried out by financial and accounting specialists . <p> Software robots now perform different tasks in firms that have adopted them , from account reconciliation to intercompany transactions , auditing expenses and managing vendor invoices and payments , recording journal entries , fixed-asset accounting and to maintain account data and perform strategic data analysis . Robotic process automation ( RPA ) is particularly useful and easily adopted in accounts payable across a companys procure-to-pay cycle , where processes such as vendor master data management and invoice processing allow for a greater degree of automation . <p> Some other processes that require the analysis of vendor metadata or strategic analysis are better suited to having trained staff analyse data after it has been collated and sieved into useful formats by robots . <p> Despite naysayers , the growing trend for RPA is unlikely to replace a majority of finance and accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountants and finance specialists play a more strategic part in a companys planning and financial analysis . <p> A/C processes have been traditionally performed by employees working to complete repetitive , time-consuming tasks . But now most of these tasks can be automated , freeing up staff to focus on broader strategic financial analysis . <p> RPA software can be set up to work across the different processes in the procure-to-pay cycle where it functions like a virtual back-end processing centre . It can interact with documents , databases and ERP systems using specific logins . <p> Software robots link applications on an internal and external level . File systems , databases and application programming interfaces ( APIs ) are automated by robots , without the need of full system integration . <p> The benefits of the implementation are manifold . The robots areextremely accurate , make no data errors and do n't  overlook steps . Robots perform these repetitive tasks faster and more efficiently than humans and can easily be scaled up and down to meet the needs and demands of the business . <p> As well as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create audit trails and logs needed for regulatory compliance as they work . Processes such as error reconciliation and account closure become more expedient and almost entirely free from errors with RPA . <p> Discrepancies in vendor contact information in invoices or purchase orders and purchase order amounts can be more rapidly dealt with , therefore eliminating the need for costly oversight and exception handling . <p> This automation can be combined with configurable workflow and data extraction solutions for speedy approval , to implement data structure and to optimise vendor discount management . <p> Robotic software has been especially beneficial for A/P processes where invoice processing is required . This is due mostly to recent advances in RPA technologies that can read and interpret unstandardised invoices and make sense of unstructured data something previous software has been unable to achieve . <p> Invoice processing commonly requires the data entry of indexed invoice data into ERP or legacy systems so that there is matching of the Goods Received Note ( GRN ) , invoice and Purchase Order ( PO ) . But these laborious tasks can now be easily automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming vendor invoices , to produce expense reports and even to process vendor payments and handle disputes or claims . <p> The key software technologies in RPA software produced by companies such as UiPath and Blue Prism that makes this possible are optical character recognition ( ORC ) and Intelligent Character Recognition ( ICR ) . <p> Software with OCR can distinguish differences in text , such as how A is different to B , when users are operating in remote applications and databases like Citrix . ICR helps robots recognise images like buttons and data fields picking out specific information and collating and processing it into useful information . Staff can train robots by do as I do point and click configuration at the user interface level . By mimicking user employee actions , RPA software can be deployed to manipulate and transfer application system data quickly and accurately . <p> Of course , adoption of RPA is not without its challenges . One of the biggest challenges to RPA in an organisation is lack of standardisation in invoicing and documentation that can make it difficult to crosscheck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar problems . <p> Organisations need to adopt technologies that can assist collection of data as it is inputted so that it can be standardised . One way is to leverage the ORC technologies for proto invoicing whereby identified patterns in the data fields of invoices are used to generate invoices automatically . <p> Process inefficiencies can affect the effectiveness of software robots , highlighting the importance of organisations to streamline these processes . Examples of process inefficiencies include missing vendor codes and manual approval processes that can lead to delays . Effective process discipline is vital in a manual setup , since AP processes greatly depend on the staffs training and skillset . <p> In Australia , vendor agnostic sourcing and management advisory services company , Minefields , released a report into RPA in the Australian financial services sector . The report estimated a 30 per cent cost savings to Australian adoptees of RPA . <p> Minefields surveyed leading service providers in Australia about their plans to adopt RPA . A huge 90 per cent said they were committed to adopt the technology in the future . <p> Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the wave of innovation . Big players Telstra , ANZ , Westpac and AMP have implemented some form of RPA into their business . <p> Will RPA reduce finance sector jobs ? The term jobpocalypse has been used to describe possible widespread job losses in the industry due to RPA . But industry experts remain optimistic about jobs . <p> The Mindfields report cites a 20 per cent reduction in staff numbers in businesses that have adopted RPA , not a significant figure . But the report also states it is highly likely that the market will continue to evolve and new job opportunities will emerge , particularly in key areas such as cloud , big data and advanced visualisation . <p> To prepare your accounts payable for RPA ensure you standardise your invoices as much as possible by ensuring invoices are of a similar format . Also , reduce inconsistent and unstructured data across the lifecycle of your business from generation of invoice receipt to approval . Most importantly , eliminate process inefficiencies by reducing manual approval processes and ensuring effective process discipline across your business sectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast Business team are a group of dedicated journalists and writers who create content on behalf of Canon .

@@14685975 @3285975/ <h> What is Focal Length ? <h> The Basics : <p> Focal length does n't  actually refer to the length from front to back of your lens ; it is in fact the distance between the optical centre of a lens and the imaging sensor of the camera . The focal length of a lens changes the angle of view which impacts the image that is ultimately captured . A shorter focal length will have a wider angle of view allowing a greater area of the subject to be captured , whereas a longer focal length has a narrower field of view resulting in greater magnification . <p> Its easiest to remember that the longer the focal length the smaller the field of view and the larger the subject appears to be . <h> A Little More Detail : <p> A standard , or normal lens ( so called because it closely approximates the human field of view ) is 50mm . Broadly speaking , anything over this becomes telephoto , while anything under becomes wide-angle . <p> The focal length of a lens is fixed for non-zoom lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EF-35 F/1.4 L II will always have a 35mm focal length . With zoom lenses , the focal length changes between a set range . For example , the EF 24-70 F2.8 L USM II will have a focal length between 24mm and 70mm , depending on much the lens is zoomed in or out . <p> One important factor to bear in mind with focal length is that the size of the imaging sensor will also affect the angle of view . For example , all of Canons EF lens range are designed to be used on Full Frame cameras , ie , a camera with a sensor that is the same size as the 35mm film format . When you put that lens on a camera with a smaller APS-C sized sensor , such as Canons entry to mid level range EOS cameras , the image will be cropped slightly , giving a telephoto effect . Because of this , you 'll often hear photographers using the term crop factor and 35mm equivalent , to explain how the imaging sensor size has changed the effective focal length . 
@@14685976 @3285976/ <h> Organisational change : Should you introduce a flat structure ? <p> 19th February 2016 , 09:24pm <h> More and more companies are implementing flat-business structures and even managerless systems . How can you decide whether its right for your business ? <p> A flat-business structure scraps top-down management in favour of putting every employee on the same playing field . While a traditional hierarchy improves efficiency , it can also be a barrier to organisational change . Companies like Google and Zappos opted for flat structures to create environments that foster innovation . So what type of businesses can benefit from a flat structure ? <p> Adaptable and innovative <p> A flat organisation typically has thin levels of management where all employees have the power to make decisions . According to researcher Tim Kastelle , this set-up is great for companies that are looking to innovate , need to respond to a rapidly changing environment and have a shared purpose . <p> In 2014 , e-commerce retailer Zappos implemented a holacracy operating structure with no job titles or managers . Its 1500 employees are now organised into about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be personally accountable for decisions . Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh says he wanted to set up an environment where " the personalities , creativity and individuality of all the different employees come out and can shine " . <p> Staff in the spotlight <p> One of the biggest benefits to adopting a flat structure is that employees generally benefit from more responsibility and autonomy . If employees are creating their own project goals , they are more driven to achieve them . <p> Additionally , employees in flat organisations tend to be more adaptable to changing circumstances and can develop their own operational processes without seeking the approval of upper management . <p> And the benefits do n't  end with increased employee engagement . Fewer management layers mean flat organisations spend less on salaries and can outsource other business functions like IT and recruiting to further reduce costs . <p> A productivity dampener ? <p> On the flip side , while a flat structure aims to heighten employee productivity , it can also work the other way . Human Capitalist warns that flat structures may not work for companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals . If your organisation relies heavily on each team member doing their own job , then it may be critical to have a well-established hierarchy . <p> Additionally , in a flat organisation , some staff may end up working passively without a clear leader . They may also be unsure about who to speak to for complicated issues . <p> Google discovered this in 2002 when it flattened its organisation to generate more concept development among employees . However , instead of making their own decisions on projects , staff went directly to co-founder Larry Page . After becoming overwhelmed with a large amount of requests , Page reinstated all managers after two months . <p> Flow-on effects <p> Adopting a flat structure can have a number of positive effects for businesses seeking an innovative and entrepreneurial culture . Companies with flat structures stay closer to customers by responding more efficiently to their changing needs . <p> Additionally , by giving everyone in the company an equal voice , businesses can discover new ideas and insights . For example , video-game developer Valve implemented a flat structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generates an estimated US$1 billion a year . <p> Overall , the key to a successful flat structure and strategic organisational change is clear communication with all employees and a cohesive culture and vision .

I 've always wanted to travel , it was the thing I wanted to do most , but I never dreamed photography would rival my passion for travel , or become the passion that enabled my travel. - <p> Having recently returned from a- Canon Collective- photo safari in Namibia I have had the great fortune of- travelling- with the sole purpose of seeking out the ultimate landscape shoot . Hosting 12 guests , we spent four days shooting in- Sossusvlei- where we worked to capture the perfect landscape photo ; think dunes for days , bright skies , glowing oranges and reds , it really was a photographer 's playground . <p> - I enjoy exploring new places and spaces and I often find myself in awe of Mother Nature , so naturally I 've found my niche shooting landscapes . <p> - Emma Desira , Canon Collective Ambassador <p> Whether you 're heading abroad , across country or just to your favourite spot down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any landscape scene you seek out . <p> - <h> So what is a good landscape photo you ask ? <p> As a landscape photographer a great deal of time is often spent seeking out the optimum location . When I 'm scouting my location I 'm often looking for a place that portrays a sense of space and depth or a location that has an interesting subject matter . If I 'm at an iconic location I consider how I can create something that is different and unique , rather than replicating shots that I have already seen . Be sure to also scout your location under different lighting conditions , the same location can look significantly different at various times throughout the day . Quite often success comes from shooting the same landscape on many occasions , do n't forget that you are shooting the splendour of nature and no two days are the same . <p> - <p> Once I 've found my location , I believe a great landscape photo is a combination of great technical and compositional skills and an insightful understanding of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a unique point of difference and if you can make the audience feel something , then even better. - <h> Once you have found your location , let 's talk about gear and camera set up for landscape photography <p> I 'm often asked which lens should I use ? When we shoot a landscape typically our subject is quite a distance away from us and we are capturing a wide amount of space . As such landscapes are often shot at shorter focal lengths up to approximately 35mm . The 16-35mm range is very popular for landscape photographers , while the 11-24mm appeals to those after an ultra wide option . With that said get creative and experiment ; throughout our time in Sossusvlei I primarily shot with the 100-400mm and a 24mm TSE lens , neither are your typical landscape choices but I was delighted with the results from both . <p> If you are a beginner looking for landscape photo tips and wanting to move beyond Automatic , try a semi automatic exposure setting like Aperture Value , or AV on your exposure dial . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aperture while the camera balances out the available light to ensure a nice even exposure . Your aperture selection is particularly important for landscape photography as it impacts your depth of field. - When shooting landscapes I 'd recommend f/8 - f/14 , just remember the narrower the aperture ( f/14 ) the greater your depth of field . <p> Where possible keep your ISO nice and low , ISO 100 is typically my preference , especially when I am set up with a tripod . <p> When shooting in a semi automatic exposure mode like AV , - exposure compensation can be useful for when you want to finesse your exposure making the image brighter or darker . On most Canon cameras this can be achieved by adjusting the Quick Control Dial or the Aperture/Exposure Compensation button ( AV+/- ) . By adjusting and therefore compensating to the + side the image gets brighter while adjusting to the " side makes the image darker . <p> - <p> - For those more intermediate and advanced photographers experienced shooting in a Manual Exposure mode , your aperture and ISO settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 and f/8-f/14 ) . - Once I 've selected my ISO and the desired aperture , these two settings will typically remain consistent throughout the shoot , while my shutter speed serves as the variable . <p> To make the image brighter , the shutter speed needs to be slowed down and conversely , to make the image darker the shutter speed needs to be increased . - In order to make these- judgments- I am typically guided by the camera 's internal light meter or histogram . I find the histogram particularly useful when I need to ensure I am capturing details at both extremes of my exposures ; the brightest and darkest points in my image . <p> I was always taught that a good exposure has detail in the shadows and detail in the highlights. - <p> When shooting landscapes I always travel with a sturdy tripod as it allows me to shoot with slower shutter speeds in low light . A landscape shoot at first light or last light , often requires shutter speeds between 20-30 seconds . During the exposure the tripod minimises any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or utilising the cameras in-built two-second timer can also further limit potential camera movement . Without the ability to shoot with slow shutter speeds in low light , much higher ISO 's and wider apertures will be required in order to balance out your exposure . Sometimes this is inevitable for example an Astro Landscape shoot . <p> - <p> A tripod paired with the use of ND filters also has the added advantages of shooting with slower shutter speeds during bright daylight to add a sense of movement to your images . To really create a sense of movement , try shooting in bulb mode and experiment with exposures that go beyond 30 seconds . <p> Over the years I 've learnt that the difference between a good photo and a great photo often comes down to composition . <p> The rule of thirds can be a great place to start if composition is new to you . Simply put , if you divide your frame of view into thirds vertically and horizontally you will find four intersecting points . By utilising the intersecting lines and points as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well balanced image . Landscapes often incorporate a horizon line ; consider how the rule of thirds can be used to position your horizon line . If you utilise the top thirds typically you accentuate your foreground , while placing the horizon line on the bottom third accentuates your background. - <p> We composing my images I also think about how I can incorporate design elements such as line , shape , space , texture , form and tone to add another dimension to my image . These elements can often bring a sense of direction to a shot or help frame the shot. - <p> - Considering your positioning can also be another way to increase the compositional strength of your image . Typically when we shoot we raise the camera to our eye , thus creating an image of what we see . By shooting from a higher or lower angle you can create something just a little bit different , in these instances a small shift up or down , left or right can often make all the difference . <p> - Your use and understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images . Using the right light , and knowing when to shoot can often transform a good image into something truly spectacular . Practice the art of looking , and observe your surroundings paying attention to quality and direction of the light even when you do n't have a camera in your hand . Often light is fleeting , have you ever parked the car and ran through the landscape to get just the right vantage point at just the right moment ? The practice of observing light will help create familiarity so when you are out on location with your camera , literally chasing the light and under pressure you will know exactly what to look for to craft a spectacular image . <p> Above all , do n't forget photography is about light . <p> Now it 's your turn , grab your camera and go and enjoy the beautiful great outdoors .

@@14685989 @3285989/ <h> Dr Chris Brown 's vision photographing Sperm Whales in the Azores . <p> 9th May 2017 , 08:15am <p> I 've set myself a near impossible task . Attempt to photograph one of the shiest , most mysterious creatures on their terms and in their home environment of the ocean . <p> This group of islands have to be one of the most unique and isolated locations in the world . The Azores is essentially a volcanic time capsule that 's floated to the surface in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean . <p> And its secrets are only just being discovered . A walk along the volcanic coastline reminds you of just how much ocean surrounds you . Its a quirky place full of quirky encounters of the human and animal kind ( I talk about more of these encounters from our Azores expedition here ) . That vast Atlantic ocean has provided a barrier to the culture and the environment changing but the deep , impossibly clear waters have also provided transport to allow some very special creatures to pay the islands a visit . <p> You realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally skim the surface when it comes to our interactions with the natural world . <p> With thousands of metres of volcano towering above you , thousands of metres of water under you and thousands of kilometres of ocean around you , the chances of arranging an encounter with an Azorean local at a mutually agreeable location are slim . Youve just got to hope that some luck shines down on you . <p> If it was n't already a challenge , if Sperm Whales do n't  like you , they disappear . And seriously disappear . Almost 2500m down into the deep blue water . There 's not even any light past 900m so when they want to avoid the spotlight they can really do it . Adding to the complications are the fact that I 'm in the water without scuba gear . <p> The bubbles scare off the whales so itll just be my lungs up against a whale that can easily hold their breath for 45 minutes <p> The challenge of photographing anything large like a whale is giving a sense of scale . But Krystle wont be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give me so much more . I want to capture the moment that an adventurer like Krystle encounters this so-called beast . History is littered with stories depicting sperm whales as killers capable of ramming ships to sink them . <p> Technically however , I had to be careful . We were shooting this image of a diving , fast moving whale in deep water that sucks the life out of your lungs and the light out of your frame . <p> I was shooting everything on one crazy breath of air and having to make multiple adjustments for focus and light changes . <p> But first we had to find them . <p> Wildlife have a way of looking at your plans and laughing at them . You can get frustrated but in a way they 're simply finessing your trip to ensure you truly treasure the encounter that you are finally gifted . <p> After consistent whale sightings for weeks , we hit the water and did n't  see a single whale for five days . <p> It was hurting us to know such incredible encounters were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me even more intrigued by the social structure of these whales . What event had caused every single sperm whale to disappear from our island and congregate elsewhere ? A feeding frenzy ? A birth ? Or perhaps a death in the family ? Whatever it was , the first sighting of the whales after this event saw the most peculiar bonding moments that many locals had never witnessed . Up to 10 sperm whales were swimming in formation and then spending long periods of time gently caressing each other . <p> It really was a moment where you begin to wonder whether their concept of family is even stronger than ours . <p> Its always hard to compare anything to your first sperm whale encounter . After five days of nothing , we had received word that a blow had been seen . These blasts of air from the blowhole are often the only indication you get . So naturally we were desperate to get in the water . But these whales were incredibly shy and diving at the first sign of a boat . <p> You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember hunting so its probably not a surprise . <p> Anyway , I 'd been dropped into the water to swim to where we thought a blow had come from . But there was nothing . Suddenly , with me still in the water , the team saw another blow 200m away so they sped off in that direction leaving me behind . But then , the eeriest thing happened . I began to feel the communication clicks of a whale . Thinking I was imagining it , I stuck my head under and they were certainly coming in fast and loud . A few seconds later , through the blue , I saw the most remarkable sight . A 25 metre long sperm whale sped through the water like a submarine , arcing and fixing that big eye on me as he passed . <p> He was clearly as surprised as I was but I managed to capture the moment with an image I 'm incredibly proud of . This will stay with me for a lifetime . <p> I love the way this film captures the quirky nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle from this far away place that really demonstrates the beauty of the Azores along with the challenges you face filming in a place that time has forgotten . <p> First contact . This is the moment I refer to above . This is shot off a 14mm lens meaning he s far closer than he seems . The clicks he was directing towards me ( their form of sonar ) were telling him exactly who or what I was . I often look into that eye and wonder who was more surprised <p> The final image . Incredibly , this was taken on the last morning . After 11 days in the Azores , it took the last few hours to nail the image I 'd been dreaming of all along . In spite of whale shyness , family business and underwater housing issues , we finally had the image we wanted . The moment where the misunderstood giants of the deep met with Krystle in neutral territory . <p> Its a scary thought that there are over 2000m of ocean beneath you . Here , Krystle Wright explores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small . <p> The " Vigia " ( whale spotters ) are revered characters on the island . They were the eyes of the whale hunting industry , but today still work by spotting whales often up to 20km off the coast , but for a more peaceful purpose . Tourism . They 're also methodical record keepers and have details of every whale that has swum past Pico island ( and blasted air out of its blow hole ) for the last 30 years . There 's some history in those hands <p> Manta Ray . These ocean giants are renowned for being shy , but this guy was far from it . In fact for almost an hour we swam , circled and summersaulted together .

I 've used an aperture of f/3.2 , speed of 5.2 " and and ISO of 400 for this shot . <p> What I love about this shot is that there were no stars out and it was cloudy early in the evening , but somehow through those sparks flying into the air I was able to create stars of my own . <p> Later in the evening the stars came out and I managed to capture this great image of friends around the campfire .

And I guess the hope is that the image allows you to enjoy the meal long after the taste of it has faded . <p> Straight away I always have to fight the initial urge to dive right in and start eating when a beautiful and delicious meal is served , because right now the priority is getting a nice shot . <p> I always look to find a focal point the key to what might be a great food photograph . I am always looking at textures , at colours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a food priority straight away . <p> You could say I 've got a bit of a unique approach to food photography , I kind of see food like a landscape on a plate . <p> To capture this landscape on my plate , I have used an aperture of f/2.8 , speed of 1/200 " and ISO of 100 . So in this image , my duck is like a mountain range and all the little bits around it , like the orange and the peas , is kind of like the foreground of the shot . And just like a landscape photograph , I am trying to find a way to step the eye from the foreground to the background . <p> So for a different view in landscape photography you may get up in a helicopter and take an aerial view , and likewise shooting from above works really well with food because it gives you a really good idea of the texture and the layout of the dish . So no matter whether its the colours of Indian spices or the wafts of a Brazilian churrasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a landscape and work your angles .

@@14686068 @3286068/ <h> Daniel Linnet 's Top 10 Speedlite Tips <p> Although it might seem daunting at first , the Speedlite is actually one of the easiest tools to operate straight out of the box . <p> I call it " sun in a can " , simply because it allows me to place the light exactly where I want it , when I want it , opening up a whole new world of creative possibilities . <p> Just like learning how to use your camera for the first time , it requires a little bit of practice and a touch of perseverance but the reward when you finally grasp it are well worth it . Here are my top tips to get you started . <h> Tip #1 : Do not fear <p> Using flash should never be a frightening experience , in fact these days the communication between the camera and your flash ( ETTL or Evaluative Through the Lens ) is so advanced you can often just switch it on and it will give you good results straight up . Great results however , take just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Understand natural light <p> My suggestion is always to first get a basic understanding of working with natural light before progressing to using flash . Often you will either be trying to emulate , substitute or supplement natural light with your flash . Learn to understand and see lighting directions such as front , side , rear and 45 degree light . This is of great value when deciding on where to place your flash when using it off camera . <h> Tip #3 : Imagine the sun <p> Whenever I use flash , I find it helps me predict what effect it will have on my image by visualising each Speedlite as portable sunlight that is placed in the ideal position for my desired effect . <p> Above Image - single Speedlite placed high at camera right to recreate light coming through a small window near the roof of this underground bakery . <h> Tip #4 : Know when to use flash <p> Flash can be used in a number of practical and creative ways . <p> As a main source of light to illuminate your subject when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as low lit indoor events and functions or night time photography . <p> To fill in the shadows when the contrast range of a photograph is too great . Also know as " fill flash " . <p> On a grey overcast ( low contrast ) day , to add direction and contrast to the lighting , making your subject pop ! <p> On dark foreground subjects against a sunset background to help balance the exposure levels <p> Above Image - single on camera Speedlite in ETTL mode ( +/- 0 ) to balance the subjects with the brighter background . <h> Tip #5 : Know your camera 's maximum sync speed <p> This is the fastest shutter speed at which the flash would synchronise with the camera . Generally for DSLR cameras it is between 1/160sec and 1/250 sec . The newer breed of mirrorless cameras are able to sync at much faster shutter speeds ( often up to 1/2000sec ) for that very reason there 's no mirror to pop out of the way . <p> All shutter speeds slower than your maximum sync speed are okay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds High Speed Sync mode is available <h> High Speed Sync <p> This flash mode allows you to synchronise the flash at faster shutter speeds , but with a trade off . The best way to describe the difference is that during normal sync , when the mirror is up and out of the way and the shutter fully open , the flash discharges during that exposure . With high speed sync , the exposure happens during the flash . In other words the flash starts firing just before the exposure adding to the existing light for when the exposure happens . As a result you get considerably less power output and greater drain on the batteries . This is best used for fill flash in bright contrasting environments . <h> Slow Speed Sync <p> Because the flash burst happens so fast it can often be used to freeze movement when using slower shutter speeds to bring in more of the available light or create movement effects . Try using flash at slower shutter speeds like 1/30th , 1/15th or even slower to get something like this : <p> Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec ) to capture the existing background lights and colour with single on-camera Speedlite in ETTL mode . Aperture was set at f2.8 . <h> Tip #6 : Trust in ETTL <p> The lens flash metering uses your cameras internal light meter to measure the required flash output based on your selected aperture . This is aided by other information being relayed to the flash at the same time , such as the distance of the subject to the camera ( from lens focusing information ) for greater exposure accuracy .

Renowned beach photographer Eugene Tan set the scene for the launch at Bondi Icebergs , with the high-achieving founder of Bondi-based Aquabumps gallery , publisher and aerial photography pioneer unveiling his most audacious project to date . <p> The result of a 12-month journey , and with the support of Canon , Tan achieved his long-held dream of producing a huge print of one of his aerial photographs for everyone to enjoy . Over a 24-hour period Tan installed a 49-metre long , 13-metre wide , 700 square metre print of one of his most popular shots taken above the Italian Amalfi Coast on the bottom of the famous Bondi Icebergs swimming pool . He then took to the air to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening to print the shots and unveil them together with the rest of the Amalfi collection to 120 guests assembled at Icebergs overlooking the art installation . <p> " The Icebergs exhibition is a melting pot of my passions : aerial photography , Italy , the beach , Bondi , and large-scale prints , " says Tan . " I pioneered aerial beach photography in Australia over 10 years ago and have always wanted to produce one of my aerial images publically in a huge format . Icebergs was a logical location choice and the closest replication of the famous Italian beach clubs on the Amalfi Coast , which has become one of my favourite locations to shoot . " <p> " For this to be at the iconic Icebergs pool in Bondi Beach , where Aquabumps started 18 years ago , is really a dream come true . I started Aquabumps because of my passion and love of the beach and to share my images with more than 300,000 people daily all over the world to be able to show them this will be pretty cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in partnership with Canon Australia , Eugene Tans installation kicks off the Show Us What 's Possible initiative , which challenges professional photographers , cinematographers , and creative artists to push the boundaries of their imagination and , through their amazing work , redefine the creative potential of Canon products . <p> " Were proud of the gear we make but its only in the hands of creative artists that we can see what 's truly possible when using Canon products , " says Jason McLean , Canon Australias Director of Consumer Imaging . " Show Us What 's Possible was born from our desire to support professional creatives in making their big dreams a reality and help them push the boundaries . " <p> " With the Bondi Icebergs spectacle , Eugene has shown us an amazing application of print , photography and video to create a visually stunning installation and content for all to enjoy . We cant wait to see the incredible work to come from creatives around the country . " <p> Tan fell in love with shooting Italy from above in 2015 specifically the Amalfi Coast with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular artworks to feature in Aquabumps Bondi gallery . <p> The project was realised using Canon capture and print equipment including the 50-megapixel EOS 5DsR DSLR camera and the Arizona 550 flatbed inkjet printer . After a 50 hour printing process , Aquabumps production partner for large-format applications , Scaffad , spent five hours installing the 24-piece print on the bottom of Bondi Icebergs pool . <p> Eugene Tans documentary film of the making of his art installation will be launched online in early March on Canons Stories and Aquabumps channels . Additionally , Aquabumps is today opening a new gallery at 119 George Street in The Rocks , Sydney , after a dedicated 15 years in Bondi . <p> Make your dreams a reality : <p> Show Us What 's Possible encourages the most creative individuals to pitch their remarkable projects to Canon Australia for support .

@@14686084 @3286084/ <h> A scientific approach to innovation <p> 20th July 2016 , 09:24pm <h> How do we really drive innovation in business ? <p> When most of us think of innovation , we think of a lone genius such as Elon Musk dreaming up disruptive ideas destined to change the world . The reality , however , is somewhat more prosaic . While lone geniuses have changed the world , innovation , especially in the early decades of the 21st century , is more likely to be a team effort . <p> While its tempting to think of innovation as something that 's somehow organic and just springs into the world from someones consciousness , Dr Amantha Imber , a Melbourne innovation psychologist and founder of Inventium , spends much of her time reading scientific journals to get a deeper understanding of what spurs on innovation . <p> Spanning fields such as psychology , cognitive science , neuropsychology and management science , she looks at research that demonstrates effective methods to get increased innovation output as a result . <p> Defining the structure and strategy <p> Possibly the most important insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organisations , innovation ca n't be left to chance ; it needs to be a process with a defined structure and strategy . She says that while it may sound like a motherhood statement , the first priority of organisations wanting to innovate is to have an innovation strategy . <p> " By that I mean a clear point of view on where they want to focus their innovation efforts . One of the key considerations is making sure their areas of focus are not just about incremental innovation in the core business . They need to be making sure there is a focus on more disruptive or breakthrough opportunities they can pursue . " <p> The second thing organisations need to have is a clear process for innovation . So , consider " what are the key stages we need to go through for an innovation to be successful " , Dr Imber says . Its also vital to answer the question , " if someone in the company has a great idea , what do they do with that idea ? " . <p> However , some organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation . So do n't  rock the boat , says Dr Imber . Organisations need a process that sits outside the normal hierarchy of the organisation . The process makes really clear the what and how for people to engage with innovation in the organisation . <p> While its vital to have a strategy to embrace innovation and a process for bringing a potential innovation to management , Dr Imber also argues for the creation of innovation capability within organisations . Flying in the face of lone genius nostrums of innovation , she believes that " innovators are made as opposed to born " . So , what that means for organisations is that they need to invest time and money in training their people in how to be better innovators , she says . <p> Culture is vital <p> Organisations need to look at their culture and deliberately build a culture where innovation thrives . Dr Imber goes into the process in some depth in her book , The Innovation Formula , but among the elements required to build such a culture is the need for managers to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation culture has found that within organisations with lots of layers , managers and particularly top management , need to really walk the talk . They need to talk about innovation and why its important and actually demonstrate that through their behaviours and engage directly in innovation . " <p> The worst thing that can happen is when staff members hear senior leaders , or the CEO of the company , talking a lot about innovation but not actually following through with action , explains Dr Imber . <p> Fighting decision fatigue <p> Other techniques that Inventium has come up with for fostering innovation in business include down-to-earth , coalface methods such as changing the way brainstorming sessions are conducted and different ways of looking at a challenge . Dr Imber says that after Inventium had come across some research on decision fatigue , it became apparent that the way idea generation workshops are usually held would n't produce an optimal result . <p> Decision fatigue comes out of the concept that our ability to make decisions , or our willpower , is a finite resource . Some people have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time but , nonetheless , its a finite resource . If we make a decision after we 've exhausted that resource , were unlikely to make good ones . <p> " We found that how most organisations run idea generation workshops is theyll take a full day out of the office , spend all morning generating ideas and then in the afternoon , theyll start to make decisions . That 's not utilising how the brain works most effectively , so we rethink innovation workshops by breaking them into two half days one morning where were generating ideas and then come back together the next morning , and that 's when we make decisions . " <p> Crushing assumptions <p> Inventium has also developed a tool called The Assumption Crusher . Dr Imber explains : " You think of all the assumptions you hold in relation to this problem you are trying to solve . Assumptions stem from your thinking and can be real or perceived . For example , one common assumption is our budget is X dollars to solve this problem . So what you want to do once youve identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to crush an assumption is by asking what if the opposite was true . For example , the assumption might be there 's an available budget of $50,000 to solve a problem . But what if there was only $5 to solve the problem what could that look like ? Or , what if there was $5 million to solve it what could that look like ? <p> Just by crushing those assumptions , it really shifts your point of view immensely and really opens up a whole range of solutions that were not available to your brain because your brain cant help but make assumptions , says Dr Imber . <p> 18 months to an innovative organisation <p> While learning The Assumption Crusher technique may only take five minutes , Inventium typically works with companies for a much longer period of time . " To change things at a systems level cutting across a whole organisation , you want to allow a good six to 12 months , " says Dr Imber , pointing to client Mirvac , which her team worked with the property developer intensively for 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them transform how the company approached innovation . They were at the time quite reactive and they did n't  have a clear innovation strategy . And over the course of 18 months , we helped them build an innovation program they called Mirvac Hatch . <p> Dr Imber and her team helped Mirvac set a clear innovation strategy for where they were going to be focusing their innovation efforts . They then built an organisation wide innovation process and about 40 innovation champions were trained , who essentially are the mentors , coaches and facilitators of innovation to the several thousand employees who work across Mirvac . <p> The result proved that taking a systematic , scientific approach to innovation could pay off beyond an organisations wildest expectations . The company debuted at number three on the Australian Financial Review ( formerly BRW ) 50 Most Innovative Companies list for 2015 and was awarded the Best Innovation Program . There 's a science behind everything , and when it comes to innovation , it may just be the missing key to you businesss success . <h> Article by Darren Baguley <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on a plethora of business and technology titles .

When I came across photos of Mount Paris Dam it immediately jumped to the top of my hit list . It was decommissioned in 1965twenty years later holes were blasted through the walls to reclaim the natural river flow . I 'm an engineer and nature lover , so this place ticked all the boxes . I also enjoy getting lost , which is exactly what happened when we tried to find this place . <p> When I came across photos of Mount Paris Dam it immediately jumped to the top of my hit list . <p> I was with two friends and I did n't  fully research how to get to the damwe foolishly relied on Google Maps to point the way .

So when we got as close as possible to the dot on Google Maps we parked our cars and started walking . At that point , Google said the dam was about two kilometres away . <p> Not so . We ended up walking six kilometres all up , trying unsuccessfully to find the dam . Worst of all we had no reception ! We eventually decided to walk back to cars and drive the rest of the way . No joke , a further three kilometres along the road we found a homemade sign pointing in the direction of the dam . Thank you Google for that unexpected hike . <p> We found a homemade sign pointing in the direction of the dam . <p> In the end the hike was a blessing in disguise .
