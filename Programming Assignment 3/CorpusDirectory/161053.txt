@@35723234 @4723234/ <h> Jesus Christ : Resurrection and Ascension <p> Template:JesusNavigation <p> The resurrection of Jesus , with its completion in the ascension , setting the seal of the Father 's acceptance on His finished work on earth , and marking the decisive change from His state of humiliation to that of exaltation , may be called in a true sense the corner stone of Christianity ( compare 1Co 15:14,17 ) . It was on the preaching of Christ crucified and risen that the Christian church was founded ( e.g. Ac 2:32-36 ; 1Co 15:3,4 ) . Professor Harnack would distinguish between " the Easter faith " ( that Jesus lives with God ) and " the Easter message , " but the church never had any Easter faith apart from the Easter message . The subversion of the fact of the resurrection is therefore a first task to which unbelief addresses itself . The modern spirit rules it out a priori as miraculous . The historical fact is denied , and innumerable theories ( imposture , theories of swoon , of hallucination , mythical theories , spiritualistic theories , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these theories can stand calm examination ( see the writer 's work , The Resurrection of Jesus ) . The objections are but small dust of the balance compared with the strength of the evidence for the fact . From the standpoint of faith , the resurrection of Jesus is the most credible of events . If Jesus was indeed such an One as the gospel history declares Him to be , it was impossible that death should hold Him ( Ac 2:24 ) . The resurrection , in turn , confirms His claim to be the Son of God ( Ro 1:4 ) . <h> The Resurrection <p> ( Matthew 28 ; Mark 16 ; Luke 24 ; John 20 ; 21 ; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 ) <p> With the narratives of the resurrection are here included as inseparably connected , those of the appearances of Jesus in Jerusalem and Galilee . The accounts will show that , while the body of Jesus was a true body , identical with that which suffered on the cross ( it could be seen , touched , handled ) , it exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a new phase of existence , in which some at least of the ordinary limitations of body were transcended . Its condition in the interval between the resurrection and the ascension was an intermediate one--no longer simply natural , yet not fully entered into the state of glorification . " I am not yet ascended .... I ascend " ( Joh 20:17 ) ; in these two parts of the one saying the mystery of the resurrection body is comprised . <h> a ) The Easter Morning--the Open Tomb <p> The main facts in the resurrection narratives stand out clearly . " According to all the Gospels , " the arch-skeptic Strauss concedes , " Jesus , after having been buried on the Friday evening , and lain during the Sabbath in the grave , came out of it restored to life at daybreak on Sunday " ( New Life of Jesus , I , 397 , English translations ) . Discrepancies are alleged in detail as to the time , number , and names of the women , number of angels , etc. ; but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , while Joh gives a more detailed account of particular events . <p> ( 1 ) The Angel and the Keepers . <p> No eye beheld the actual resurrection , which took place in the early morning , while it was still dark . Matthew records that there was " a great earthquake , " and tells of the descent of an angel of the Lord , who rolled away the stone , and sat upon it . Before his dazzling aspect the keepers became as dead men , and afterward fled . The chief priests bribed them to conceal the facts , and say the body had been stolen ( Mt 28:2-4,11-15 ) . <p> ( 2 ) Visit of the Women . <p> The first intimation of the resurrection to the disciples was the discovery of the empty tomb by the women who had come at early dawn ( Mt 28:1 ; Mr 16:2 ; Lu 24:1 ; Joh 20:1 ) with spices , prepared to anoint the body of Jesus ( Mr 16:1 ; compare Lu 23:56 ) . Apparently ignorant of the guard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll away the stone from the door of the tomb ( Mr 16:3 ) , and were much surprised to find the stone rolled away , and the tomb open . There is no need for supposing that the women mentioned all came together . It is much more probable that they came in different groups or companies--perhaps Mary Magdalene and the other Mary , or these with Salome , first ( Matthew , Mark ; compare the " we " of Joh 20:2 ) ; then Joanna and other members of the Galilean band ( Luke ) . ( On the appearance of Jesus to Mary , see below . ) <p> ( 3 ) The Angelic Message . <p> As the women stood , perplexed and affrighted , at the tomb , they received a vision of angels ( Matthew and Mark speak only of one angel ; Luke and John mention two ; all allude to the dazzling brightness ) , who announced to them that Jesus had risen ( " He is not here ; for he is risen ; .... come , see the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell His disciples that He went before them to Galilee , where they should see Him ( Matthew , Mark ; Luke , who does not record the Galilean appearances , omits this part , and recalls the words spoken by Jesus in Galilee , concerning His death and resurrection ; compare Mt 16:21 ) . The women departed with " trembling and astonishment " ( Mark ) , yet " with great joy " ( Matthew ) . Here the original Mr breaks off ( Mr 16:8 ) , the remaining verses being an appendix . But it is granted that Mark must originally have contained an account of the report to the disciples , and of an appearance of Jesus in Galilee. <h> b ) Visit of Peter and John--Appearance to Mary <p> ( John ; compare Mark 16:9,10 ; Luke 24:12,24 ) <p> The narrative in John enlarges in important respects those of the Synoptics . From it we learn that Mary Magdalene ( no companion is named , but one at least is implied in the " we " of 20:2 ) , concluding from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at once ran to carry the news to Peter and John ( " They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we know not where they have laid him " ) . These apostles lost no time in hastening to the spot . John , who arrived first , stooping down , saw the linen cloths lying , while Peter , entering , beheld also the napkin for the head rolled up in a place by itself . After John likewise had entered ( " He saw , and believed " ) , they returned to their home . Meanwhile Mary had come back disconsolate to the tomb , where , looking in , she , like the other women , had a vision of two angels . It was then that Jesus addressed her , " Why weepest thou ? " At first she thought it was the gardener , but on Jesus tenderly naming her , " Mary , " she recognized who it was , and , with the exclamation , " Rabboni " ( " Teacher " ) , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " etc . ( Joh 20:17 , margin " Take not hold on me " ) , i.e. " Do not wait , but hasten to tell my disciples that I am risen , and ascend to my Father " ( the ascension-life had already begun , altering earlier relations ) . <p> Report to the Disciples--Incredulity . <p> The appearance of Jesus to the other women ( Mt 28:9,10 ) is referred to below . It is probable that , on the way back , Mary Magdalene rejoined her sisters , and that the errand to the disciples--or such of them as could be found--was undertaken together . Their report was received with incredulity ( Lu 24:11 ; compare Mr 16:11 ) . The visit of Peter referred to in Lu 24:12 is doubtless that recorded more precisely in John . <h> c ) Other Easter-Day Appearances ( Emmaus , Jerusalem ) <p> Ten appearances of Jesus altogether after His resurrection are recorded , or are referred to ; of these five were on the day of resurrection . They are the following : <p> ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described . <p> ( 2 ) The second is an appearance to the women as they returned from the tomb , recorded in Mt 28:9,10 . Jesus met them , saying , " All hail , " and as they took hold of His feet and worshipped Him , He renewed the commission they had received for the disciples . Some regard this as only a generalization of the appearance to Mary Magdalene , but it seems distinct . <p> ( 3 ) An appearance to Peter , attested by both Lu 24:34 and Paul ( 1Co 15:5 ) . This must have been early in the day , probably soon after Peter 's visit to the tomb . No particulars are given of this interview , so marked an act of grace of the risen Lord to His repentant apostle . The news of it occasioned much excitement among the disciples ( Lu 24:34 ) . <p> ( 4 ) The fourth was an appearance to two disciples on their way from Jerusalem to Emmaus--a village about two hours distant ( Lu 24:12-35 ; Mr 16:12,13 ) . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and on the strange tidings of the women 's vision of angels , when Jesus overtook them , and entered into conversation with them . At first they did not recognize Him--a token , as in Mary 's case , of change in His appearance--though their hearts burned within them as He opened to them the Scriptures about Christ 's sufferings and glory . As the day was closing , Jesus abode with them to the evening meal ; then , as He blessed and brake the bread , " Their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight " ( Lu 24:30,31 ) . They hastily rose , and returned to the company of disciples at Jerusalem . According to Mr 16:13 , their testimony , like that of the women , was not at first believed . <h> d ) The Second Appearance to the Eleven--the Doubt of Thomas <p> Eight days after this first appearance--i.e. the next Sunday evening--a second appearance of Jesus to the apostles took place in the same chamber and under like conditions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of this second meeting was the removal of the doubt of Thomas who , it is related , had not been present on the former occasion . Thomas , devoted ( compare Joh 11:16 ) , but of naturally questioning temperament ( Joh 14:5 ) , refused to believe on the mere report of others that the Lord had risen , and demanded indubitable sensible evidence for himself . Jesus , at the second appearance , after salutation as before , graciously gave the doubting apostle the evidence he asked : " Reach hither thy finger , and see my hands , " etc . ( Joh 20:27 ) , though , as the event proved , the sign was not needed . The faith and love of the erst-while doubter leaped forth at once in adoring confession : " My Lord and my God . " It was well ; but Jesus reminded him that the highest faith is not that which waits on the evidence of sense ( " Blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed , " Joh 20:29 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts for the time to Galilee . Jesus had appointed to meet with His disciples in Galilee ( Mt 26:32 ; Mr 16:7 ; compare Mr 14:28 ) . Prior , however , to this meeting--that recorded in Mt 28:16-20 , probably to be identified with the appearance " to above five hundred brethren at once " mentioned by Paul ( 1Co 15:6 ) --there is another appearance of Jesus to seven disciples at the Lake of Galilee , of which the story is preserved in Joh 21:1-23 . <p> ( 1 ) At the Sea of Tiberias--the Draught of Fishes--Peter 's Restoration . <p> The chapter which narrates this appearance of Jesus at the Lake of Galilee ( " Sea of Tiberias " ) is a supplement to the Gospel , but is so evidently Johannine in character that it may safely be accepted as from the pen of the beloved disciple ( thus Lightfoot , Meyer , Godet , Alford , etc . ) . The appearance itself is described as the third to the disciples ( Joh 21:14 ) , i.e. the third to the apostles collectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been present , of whom five are named--Peter , Thomas , Nathaniel ( probably to be identified with Bartholomew ) , and the sons of Zebedee , James and John . The disciples had spent the night in fishing without result . In the morning Jesus--yet unrecognized--appeared on the beach , and bade them cast down their net on the right side of the boat . The draught of fishes which they took revealed to John the presence of the Master . " It is the Lord , " he said to Peter , who at once flung himself into the lake to go to Jesus . On landing , the disciples found a fire of coals , with fish placed on it , and bread ; and Jesus Himself , after more fish had been brought , distributed the food , and , it seems implied , Himself shared in the meal . Still a certain awe--another indication of a mysterious change in Christ 's appearance--restrained the disciples from asking openly , " Who art thou ? " ( Joh 21:12 ) . It was not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , before Jesus sufficiently disclosed Himself in the touching episode of the restoration of Peter ( the three-fold question , " Lovest thou me ? " answering to the three-fold denial , met by Peter 's heartfelt , " Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee , " with the words of reinstatement , " Feed my lambs , " " Feed my sheep " ) . In another way , Jesus foretold that Peter would have the opportunity of taking back his denial in the death by which he should glorify God ( Joh 21:18,19 ; tradition says he was crucified head-downward ) . Curious inquiries were set aside , and attention recalled to duty , " Follow thou me " ( Joh 21:22 ) . <p> ( 2 ) On the Mountain--the Great Commission--Baptism . <p> Though only the eleven apostles are named in Matthew 's account ( Mt 28:16 ) , the fact of an appointment ' for a definite time and place ( " the mountain " ) , and the terms in which the message was given to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied in Paul 's " above five hundred brethren at once " ( 1Co 15:6 ) . The company being assembled , Jesus appeared ; still , at first , with that element of mystery in His appearance , which led some to doubt ( Mt 28:17 ) . Such doubt would speedily vanish when the Lord , announcing Himself as clothed with all authority in heaven and earth , gave to the apostles the supreme commission to " make disciples of all the nations " ( Mt 28:18-20 ; compare Mr 16:15 , " Go ye into all tho world " etc . ) . Discipleship was to be shown by baptism " into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit " ( one name , yet threefold ) , and was to be followed by instruction in Christ 's commands . Behind the commission , world-wide in its scope , and binding on every age , stands the word of never-failing encouragement , " Lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule with doubt of the resurrection itself . <p> It will be noticed that the Lord 's Supper and Baptism are the only sacraments instituted by Jesus in His church . <h> f ) Appearance to James <p> Paul records , as subsequent to the above , an appearance of Jesus to James , known as " the Lord 's brother " ( 1Co 15:7 ; compare Ga 1:19 ) . No particulars are given of this appearance , which may have occurred either in Galilee or Jerusalem . James , so far as known , was not a believer in Jesus before the crucifixion ( compare Joh 7:3 ) ; after the ascension he and the other brethren of Jesus are found in the company of the disciples ( Ac 1:14 ) , and he became afterward a chief " pillar " of the church at Jerusalem ( Ga 1:19 ; 2:9 ) . This appearance may have marked the turning-point . <h> g ) The Last Meeting <h> The Ascension <p> ( Luke 24:50-53 ; Ac 1:6-14 ; compare Mark 16:19 ) <p> Jesus had declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and Luke in Ac 1 narrates the circumstances of that departure . Jesus might simply have " vanished " from the sight of His disciples , as on previous occasions , but it was His will to leave them in a way which would visibly mark the final close of His association with them . They are found , as in the Gospel , " assembled " with Him at Jerusalem , where His final instructions are given . Then the scene insensibly changes to Olivet , where the ascension is located ( Ac 1:12 ) . The disciples inquire regarding the restoration of the kingdom to Israel ( even yet their minds are held in these temporal conceptions ) , but Jesus tells them that it is not for them to know times and seasons , which the Father had set within His own authority ( Ac 1:7 ) . Far more important was it for them to know that within the next days they should receive power from the Holy Spirit to be witnesses for Him to the uttermost part of the earth ( Ac 1:8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and a cloud received Him out of their sight ( Ac 1:9 ) . Then , as the apostles stood gazing upward , two heavenly messengers appeared , who comforted them with the assurance that in like manner as they had seen Jesus ascend into heaven , so also would He come again . For that return the church still prays and waits ( compare Re 22:20 ) . <p> See , further , ASCENSION . <p> Retracing their steps to Jerusalem , the apostles joined the larger company of disciples in the " upper room " where their meetings seem to have been habitually held , and there , with one accord , to the number of about 120 ( Ac 1:15 ) , they all continued steadfastly in prayer till " the promise of the Father " ( Lu 24:49 ; Ac 1:4 ) was , at Pentecost , bestowed upon them . 
@@35723235 @4723235/ <h> Distinctive Theologies in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew <p> In our first three lessons , we looked at themes both distinctive and dominant to the synoptic gospels ' portrait of Jesus . We looked at that which was most likely , even from a purely historical point of view , not presupposing Christian faith , to be historically accurate or inferable from that which is historically accurate . To complement this focus on the material most common to the three synoptics , we now focus in turn on the distinctive theologies or , better put , what is both dominant and distinctive within each of the given synoptic evangelists . <p> Because there is good reason to believe that Mark was the first of the four gospels written , we will begin with an overview of some of the key items dominant or distinctive to Mark . Then we will proceed to Matthew , Luke and John . So , to a theology of the gospel of Mark . For each of our four reviews of gospel theology , we will begin with views of Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel centers . Then we will move on more briefly to other key theological items in each gospel . <h> I. Key Theological Emphases in the Gospel of Mark <h> a . Mark 's View of Jesus <p> For Mark , much of what he is trying to do theologically appears to be related to the unique two-part structure of his gospel . <h> 1 . Jesus as Miracle Worker and Popular Prophet <p> It has regularly been observed that , from 1:1 to 8:29 ( or perhaps 8:30 ) , there is entirely a focus on Jesus ' adult ministry . It has rapid action , fast-paced narrative sequence and the frequent use of the word immediately to link events potentially separated by a certain amount of time to keep that sense of rapidity going . Per segment of text , there is a significant focus on Jesus as miracle-worker and as the popular self-styled prophet/rabbi that attracts ever-increasing crowds . This is in part because of His teaching , but even more because of His miracles . Indeed , there is what one might call a growing sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus as Suffering Servant <p> This is followed then abruptly with 8:30 ( or 8:31 ) to the end of the gospel with a much slower narrative in terms of the amount of time covered . There is much more of a focus on the preparation for Christ 's death and the road to the cross . There is a much higher percentage of dialogue and teaching , as over against miracles or other fast-paced events . And thus the focus is much more on Jesus as the suffering Messiah . <p> Various proposals from time-to-time have attempted to understand Mark as having inherited one of these two points of focus from his tradition " from Christians who began to put together their way of framing the life of Christ before him . Mark then uses the other one of the two emphases as a balancing feature . <p> Thus , for example , some have stressed that , as the gospel spread into Greek and Roman circles , Jesus may well have been thought of as a theos an- " r , the Greek for a divine man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a very exalted figure , but one whom Mark then ameliorates or moderates with his portrait and emphasis on Jesus as Suffering Servant . Conversely , others , though perhaps not as often , have seen Mark as inheriting the view of Suffering Servant and wanting to balance that out with his emphasis on Jesus ' great power and authority and miracle-working ability . <p> Both approaches , however , seem too one-sided . A writer wanting to play down what he believed was too strong an emphasis in his tradition would probably not have retained a full half of his gospel for that emphasis . For this reason it would seem that Mark is deliberately trying to stress both Jesus ' divinity and His humanity , both His suffering and His exultation . He stresses both the road to the cross and His coming glory foreshadowed in part already during His ministry . <h> b . Titles Used to Refer to Jesus <h> 1 . Son of God <p> In addition to this balance , a key Christological title for Mark is Son of God or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently in the gospel , it appears at highly strategic places in Mark 's narrative . First of all , it is in Mark 's opening verse which forms a kind of headline to the gospel : the beginning of the good news of Jesus , the Christ and Son of God . It recurs again in the climactic position on the lips of the centurion who watches Jesus die and confesses : " Truly this man was the Son of God " ( 15:39 ) . In between these two texts , we read that the voice from heaven designates Jesus as Son at His baptism ( 1:11 ) and then again at His transfiguration ( 9:7 ) . Intriguingly , elsewhere the title occurs only on the lips of demons representing their supernatural knowledge of Jesus ' identity ( see 3:11 ; 5:7 ) . <h> 2 . Christ <p> The other Christological title that appears in Mark 's opening verse is indeed Christ , the Greek translation of Hebrew Messiah or Anointed One . This title is not particularly common either . In fact , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Caesarea Philippi ( 8:29 ) , and then six times later in Mark 's narrative . But all of these opening eight chapters , as already noted , seem to build toward the confession on the road to Caesarea Philippi as the pivot or hinge or turning point of Mark 's gospel , with Peter 's bold announcement immediately silenced as Jesus goes on to redefine it in terms of the suffering that Peter is not yet ready to accept . <p> Indeed , what makes the title " Christ " so significant for Mark is not its frequency , but the fact that this practice of Jesus silencing those who come to recognize him as Messiah ( or its functional equivalent ) put so starkly with Peter ( 8:30 ) is a recurring both dominant and distinctive theme in Mark . It appears in the other gospels , but not nearly as frequently . More so than elsewhere , Jesus regularly commands people not to tell anyone about His identity . We see this when He separates off the insiders from the outsiders in terms of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons ' confessions of Christ are rebuked ( 1:25 , 34 ; 3:12 ) . We see it when spectacular miracles are followed up by commands to silence , as if that were realistically possible ( see for example 1:44 ; 5:18-19 , 43 ; and so on ) . <p> A famous view was promoted by the turn of the 19th to 20th century scholar , William Wrede . He dubbed this the Messianic Secret theme , or motif , in Mark 's gospel . He argued that this was Mark 's technique for introducing the view , or the conviction , that Jesus was the Messiah , when in fact He had never Himself made or acknowledged such claims . The idea then was that Mark introduced this literary fiction of Jesus , regularly silencing people who had come to this understanding , so that they would not tell others . This then supposedly explained why in Mark 's day , writing probably in the 60s , he was able to call Jesus the Messiah , even though many of his readers presumably would not have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . <p> It is much more likely , however , that Jesus did believe Himself to be the Christ and so proclaim and acknowledge that fact . But He was very hesitant about accepting the title , or accepting it unqualified . This , no doubt , would have produced premature enthusiasm for a military ruler or royal Messiah , when in fact that was not how He saw His mission during this first coming of His on earth . Clearly popular Christological hopes did not leave room for a suffering Messiah . It was not just Peter who was unprepared for such a claim . Only after Christ 's crucifixion and resurrection could His more glorious nature be described without this kind of fear of misunderstanding . Thus 9:9 is the one place in Mark 's gospel where the Messianic Secret theme appears , but a limit is put on the so-called secrecy . After His resurrection , then that veil of secrecy can be lifted . <h> 3 . Suffering Servant <p> As we noted in discussing the theology of the death of Christ in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel also that contains the two most crucial passages for demonstrating His role as Suffering Servant in 10:45 and in 14:24. <h> c . Role of Disciples and Discipleship <p> When we turn to other distinctive and/or dominant themes of the gospel of Mark outside of perspectives on Jesus , the role of disciples and discipleship hits us immediately . Somewhat akin to the Messianic Secret theme is the frequent negative portrait of the disciples , particularly with them also failing to understand fully what Jesus was about . As we already mentioned , even they , at one level , did not grasp Jesus parables , though at least they remain followers of Jesus to hear the explanations which others do not ( see 4:11-13 , 33-34 ) . Elsewhere Mark describes their heats as hardened or that they have little or no faith . They are perplexed or puzzled after various miracles . On one crucial occasion after the transfiguration , they are wholly unable to fulfill Jesus ' already previously given charge to them to cast demons out of a particular individual ( see 9:14-29 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuke Peter immediately after his confession on the road to Caesarea Philippi , because he has no room for a concept of a suffering Messiah . Indeed the account of the disciples ' spiritual blindness on this occasion is contrasted with two miracle stories shortly before and after this passage ( 8:22-26 ; 10:46-52 ) in which literal blind people received their sight and apparently become spiritual followers of Jesus as well . <p> Then , of course , climactically at the end of the gospel , Peter denies his Lord and Judas betrays Him while all the disciples flee . On the assumption that Mark 's gospel ended at 16:8 , as it does in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts , the entire narrative ends with the women fleeing the tomb saying nothing to anyone because they are afraid . <p> On the other hand , while they do fail to understand , the disciples are also those who did respond to His initial call to follow Him ( see the various call narratives in chapters 1-3 ) , are given truths that outsiders are not permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear promises about the future in which , at the end of human history as we now know it , they will receive special privileges , or in the case of Jesus ' resurrection in the more immediate future . Thus , their ultimate role seems somewhat ambiguous . <p> The same can be said for Jesus ' women followers , even though they were not part of the formal gathering of twelve apostles . Throughout most of Mark 's gospel they appear to fare better than the inner circle of twelve men . Jesus praises their tenacious faith ( 5:28 , 34 ; 7:29 ) , their sacrifice ( 12:41-44 ) and lavish love for Himself ( 14:3-9 ) . When the men flee , the women stay and are there present to watch Jesus die on the cross , to see where He is buried and go to the tomb to honor it after the Sabbath has past ( though , of course , they do not find it ) . But the women 's bewilderment at the angel 's announcement of the resurrection , their flight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel ended , somewhat qualifies their success earlier on . This suggests that ultimately all of Jesus ' followers of either gender fail Him at one point or many . <p> At first glance , this would seem to be an odd emphasis for a gospel , until we realize that Mark was probably written to Roman Christians in the 60s . This was shortly before or in the midst of Nero 's persecution of Christians in that region . Therefore , this is , in a backhanded way , a theme that has particular poignancy for these Christian churches . They would have known , by the very fact that disciples had subsequently come and evangelized them ( Peter himself being the first leader of the church in Rome ) , that the disciples did not end on the bleak note that it appears they might in Mark 's narrative alone . Jesus was able to reinstate them and use them mightily in the first generation of Christian history as described in the book of Acts . <p> Therefore , those who felt inadequate or felt that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Lord during times of persecution should have been able to take heart . Just as Jesus was able to forgive His closest followers when they repented and use them mightily , He could do the same with them . <h> d . Mark 's View of End Times as Imminent <p> Another key theme for Mark has often been identified as his view of eschatology or end-times events as still imminent . He sees it as still a lively hope of that which might happen quite soon . This is appropriate for the earliest gospel . One looks particularly at the one extensive sermon that Mark preserves compared to numerous , longer , uninterrupted messages in the other gospels and discovers that it is the sermon Jesus preached on the Mount of Olives about the events surrounding the destruction of the temple and then beyond that to the end of the age and to His return in chapter 13. <h> e . Use of the Word Gospel to Refer to the Story of Jesus ' Life and Ministry <p> So too it would appear that Mark may well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel , Greek euaggelion , or good news , for the story about Jesus , rather than just the message Jesus Himself brought and announced . This is the way a number of translations take Mark 1:1 " the gospel of Jesus Christ ; the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ . The of the means about . In several other places in Mark 's narrative , he adds the term gospel into his narrative where others do not have it . Understandably , Mark 's finished product was then given this title and it became increasingly a way of referring to a book or work of literature about Jesus . <h> II . Key Theological Emphases in the Gospel of Matthew <p> Compare then these brief theological musings concerning Mark 's theological emphases with what we find when we turn to the gospel of Matthew . Matthew 's structure , more often than not , parallels Mark 's . He too has a key turning point at Peter 's confession on the road to Caesarea Philippi in chapter 16 , with the pivot probably coming between verses 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would appear that Matthew is also particularly concerned to introduce into Mark 's narrative ( which he otherwise broadly follows ) five key segments of texts that appear as sermons or comparatively uninterrupted discourses of Jesus of a chapter or more in length . These five include the so-called Sermon on the Mount ( in chapters 5-7 ) ; the instructions to the disciples for their first missionary journey ( in chapter 10 ) ; a lengthy discourse in parables ( 13:1-52 ) , eight to be precise ; Matthew 18 entirely devoted to the topics of humility and forgiveness , both from divine and human perspectives , addressed solely to the disciples ; and then chapters 23-25 . These can be viewed as either one or two addresses back-to-back that include His woes to a select group of scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy ( chapter 23 ) , followed by His discourse , or message , to the disciples on the Mount of Olives about the coming end . <h> b . Matthew 's View of Jesus <h> 1 . Jesus as Teacher like Moses <p> Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appropriate to begin with Jesus as teacher for Matthew 's distinctive portrait . Some have even gone so far as to observe that the five blocks of sermonic material in Matthew match in number the five books of Moses in the Torah or Pentateuch ( Genesis through Deuteronomy , the five books of the law with which the Hebrew Scriptures begin ) . This may well be simply a coincidence . It is hard to know how it would be proved . But in either event it is certainly fair to see Jesus as being portrayed as a teacher like Moses , but also as One who is greater than Moses . His teaching is not simply a new law , but a law that is doable , written on human hearts as Old Testament promises of the new covenant stressed . Jesus also speaks of this in His paradoxical words in Matthew 11:28-30 in which He invites all who are weary to come to Him for His yolk is easy and His burden is light . These are terms not normally associated with that which is either easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has miracles surrounding His infancy " another key distinction between Matthew and Mark . The first two chapters of Matthew show key events surrounding Jesus ' birth . He causes turmoil among the rulers of the land , again like Moses . Again like Moses , He survives when babies His age are massacred . He retraces the journey of the exodus to and from Egypt . He is tempted in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights , just as the Israelites wandered in the wilderness . But where they gave into temptation , Jesus resists . Perhaps then , we are also to see some of this parallelism as showing Jesus succeeding where Israel of old , at the beginning of the first covenant between God and His people , proved a failure . Even mountains , much like Mount Sinai where Moses received the law in the book of Exodus , remain more significant in Matthew than in other gospels " including as places of revelation , not only in the Sermon on the Mount , but in the Transfiguration and the giving of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus <p> i . Son of David <p> Titles more common and distinctive to Matthew include Son of David , which stresses His regal ancestry and thus King and Royal Messiah as well . Son of David occurs nine times in Matthew , eight of which are not found in any other gospel . The title fits Matthew 's Jewish orientation ( which we will turn to in a moment ) , and the conventional expectation of a Messiah who would be a descendant of the lineage of the house of David and who would exercise kingly functions . Thus Herod and his followers ( 2:1-12 ) fear a literal king who will dethrone them because their power is illegitimate " illegitimately usurped . And Pilate wonders ( 27:11 ) if Jesus is a King of the Jews . Intriguingly , whereas these people in power who should have been able to recognize a true Messianic candidate but ca n't , individuals who address Jesus as Son of David are consistently the powerless ones ( particularly those in need of physical as well as spiritual healing ) . <p> ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heightened Son of God Christology in the gospel of Matthew . Key references , again , frame Matthew 's text ( see both 2:15 and 26:63 ) . The devil assumes Jesus to be God 's Son at his temptation ( 4:3 , 6 ) . Only in Matthew do the disciples confess Jesus as Son of God after he walks on the water ( 14:33 ) . This is one of those places where in Mark , dramatically different , their hearts are hardened . Of course , one can imagine some mixture of both after such a remarkable miracle , so that these need not be flat out contradictions . But it is striking how each writer chooses to emphasize a different aspect of the account in line with their overall emphases . <p> Perhaps even more striking is the elaborate expansion of the Cesarea Philippi narrative in Matthew 16 . Instead of having Peter confess Jesus as the Messiah and then having Jesus immediately silence him , Peter says : " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . " And Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , but My Father who is in heaven . " And Jesus then goes on in the famous passage regarding the keys to the kingdom to declare that on the rock , which Peter represents , He would build His church . <p> iii . Emmanuel - God with us <p> Another framing device sees Jesus as not merely a heightened Son of God but God with us , Emanuel . This title used at His conception ( 1:23 ) and implicit in His closing promise ( 28:20 ) : " I will be with you " , God with you or us always . <p> iv . Lord <p> Perhaps the most important of Matthew 's titles for Jesus is not one of his most distinctive . Many people call Him Lord here and in other gospels . And , as we noted in our last lecture , in some contexts it need mean nothing more than Master . But in several places particularly in Matthew ( see 8:2 , 6 , 25 ; 9:28 and perhaps also 2:2 ; 8:11 ; 14:33 ) , He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> c . Wisdom Incarnate <p> Finally , we may note the theme of wisdom incarnate in the gospel of Matthew . In 12:42 and 13:54 , Jesus ' wisdom is highlighted . In 11:19 , John the Baptist and Jesus are said to vindicate God 's wisdom . And in 11:25-30 , which we have already alluded to part of , Jesus calls the lowly to Himself and promises them rest in a passage quite similar to one in the intertestamental book of Wisdom attributed to Ben Sirach . Perhaps Matthew has a slightly distinctive concern , at least among the synoptic gospel writers , to portray Jesus as God 's wisdom incarnate based on the already existing pattern of Proverbs 8 and 9. <h> d . The Move from Particularism to Universalism in the Offering of the Gospel <p> Other distinctive and dominant themes for Matthew include what has been called the move from particularism to universalism in the gospel offer . More clearly than in any of the other gospels , early on in Jesus ' public ministry , He stresses that His mission is solely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He makes this claim both in the context of sending out the twelve ( 10:5-6 ) and also in His initially brusque reply to the Canaanite woman 's appeal for healing for her daughter ( 15:24 ) . <p> Yet this is also the gospel that ends with the fullest version of the Great Commission in which Jesus sends His disciples to the ends of the earth to make disciples of all nations . Matthew is the only gospel that includes the quasi-parable of the sheep and the goats ( 25:31-46 ) , announcing the judgment of all peoples or nations , presumably following the evangelism of all nations . And Matthew is the only gospel which , in its account of the parable of the wicked tenants ( 21:43 ) , includes the line from Jesus that the kingdom would be taken away from the current Jewish leadership and given to a people or nation who will produce its fruit . <p> Thus , it appears that Matthew is following very much the logic that Paul in Romans 1:16 spells out : that the gospel was first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been God 's elect people in the Old Testament . Because it was from them that the Messiah was to emerge , they had the right to hear the gospel first . But God 's intention was never to stop at that point . It was then to move on the rest of the world . <h> e . The Jewish Emphases in the Gospel of Matthew <p> The very Jewish emphases of Matthew 's gospel can be viewed in numerous other respects . Matthew quotes the Old Testament about twice as often as Mark and has about twice as many texts in which the Hebrew Scriptures are explicitly said to be fulfilled . We see a barrage of these already in the infancy narrative ( chapters 1 and 2 ) . Indeed , if one asks why Matthew includes such different events surrounding Christ 's birth as Luke ( the one other gospel to deal with this period of Jesus life ) , the answer almost certainly is because he is portraying those five clusters of events that can be said to fulfill various prophesies , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns of God 's acting in human history repeating ) . And he does so because , as early church tradition uniformly insisted , Matthew is the one gospel of the synoptics , and probably the one gospel of the four , written to exclusively , or almost exclusively , Jewish Christians . <p> Not surprisingly , he would want to link the story of Jesus as he presents it back to the Old Testament wherever possible . This was both to confirm these Jewish Christians in the choices they have made to follow Jesus , as well as to give them theological ammunition ( as it were ) to defend those choices as they share the good news with family and friends in the Jewish world who have not yet chosen to follow Jesus as Messiah . <p> In the same context , we are not surprised to see the concept of Jesus fulfilling the law and the prophets ( 5:17-20 ) . Prophecy in the sense of prediction , we , of course , expect to be fulfilled . But how is the law fulfilled " especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sermon on the Mount are all examples in which Jesus takes issue with prevailing interpretations of the law , if not with the law itself ? Presumably the answer is that the word for fulfill can and did often in the Greek , and the underlying Hebrew and Aramaic , mean something like what in English we would mean if we said to fill full " that is to bring to full completion all of the intended meaning of some initial law or principle or event . <h> f . Jesus Demands Righteousness of His Followers <p> Thus a dominant and distinctive theological emphasis in Matthew 's gospel is also that He regularly demands righteousness of His followers . Indeed Jesus requires a greater righteousness than even the key Jewish leadership ( 5:20 ) . But , again , if we appeal to 11:28-30 , we see that with this greater demand comes a greater empowerment . <h> g . Discipleship <p> When we look at Matthew 's view of discipleship and , although it can be and has been overstated , there is nevertheless a perceivable difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disciples in Mark , and a somewhat more positive picture of them in Matthew . In a number of key places where Mark stresses their lack of faith , Mathew focuses on at least a fledgling belief that they do have ( see 8:26 , 13:51 and 14:33 again ) . <h> h . Matthew Uses the Greek Word for Church , " ekklesia " <p> Intriguingly , Matthew is also the only one of the four gospels ever to use the Greek word for church , ekklesia . And then he uses it only three times and in two verses ( 16:18 ; 18:17 ) in the context of Peter 's foundational role in the assembly of the Jesus ' followers and then when similar promises are given to the entire twelve in the context of community discipline and forgiveness ( 18:17 ) . <h> i . Matthew Refers to Jesus ' Followers as " Little Ones " <p> A distinctive term for Matthew for Jesus ' followers is " little ones " ( see 10:42 ; 18:6 , 10 , 14 ; 25:40 ) , stressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that Matthew may reflect the later establishment of key offices or roles in his church , or in the Christian church more broadly , with such distinctive references as those to wise men , prophets and scribes ( 10:41 ; 13:52 ; 23:34 ) . <p> He may even be concerned to oppose false teachers in his midst who rely on a kind of charismatic or elitist 's spiritual , self-appointed authority despite an unwillingness to follow even basic universal moral law that spans both covenants . This could explain the strong warnings of the Sermon on the Mount ( for example , 7:15-23 ) . <h> j . Growing Conflict with Jewish Authorities <p> Finally , a key theological emphasis in Matthew , also reflecting the narrative structure of the gospel , is the growing conflict with Jewish authorities . Whereas in Mark , these conflicts seem to punctuate a narrative which otherwise returns to speak of Jesus ' popularity and fame until reasonably close to the final stages of His earthly life , in Matthew a graph could be plotted of a fairly linear downward progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of His society as things become more and more hostile as Matthew 's narrative unfolds . <p> How does this mesh with a gospel which , as we have already seen , is otherwise so thoroughly Jewish ? Most likely Matthew 's Jewish Christian audience , sometime in the 60s at the earliest , has increasingly broken from the local synagogue many times . No doubt , this was because it was the Jews who expelled their members who acknowledge Jesus as Messiah . But , as we see so often in the book of Acts when Paul is rejected by sufficient numbers of the local synagogue so that he turns to the Gentiles in that community , the location of his ministry does not geographically move very far afield . Indeed , Graham Stanton has used the expression " the synagogue across the street " based on various archeological excavations from communities in the ancient Mediterranean world where church and synagogue were literally across the street to one another to suggest the theological environment in which Matthew 's church finds itself . Or , put another way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them and simply become assimilated to part of a larger Gentile community . They are still actively engaged in defending their choices and in trying to call their Jewish friends and family to join them . <p> Thus warnings of coming judgment make sense in this context " even the strong ones , like the woes of chapter 23 or the cries of the crowd at the crucifixion in 27:25 , " His blood be on us and on our children . " Nothing here should be taken as indicting the entire Jewish people or a generation beyond that in which judgment did fall on the children of the generation that crucified Jesus ( that is to say , in the destruction of Jerusalem in AD70 by the Romans , 40 years after Christ 's crucifixion in AD30 ) . Still there is judgment on those who were antagonists toward Jesus and never repented from that position . Many of these then went on to be persecutors of Jesus ' followers as well . <p> Given this background it is not surprising that Matthew has a distinctive and dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they held the power in the Sanhedrin at the time of Jesus ' crucifixion . They appear seven times in Matthew , always negatively , whereas in the rest of the gospels they appear only twice . 
@@35723238 @4723238/ <h> Centrality of Christ and God in Paul 's Theology <p> Hello . I am Tom Schreiner and I teach New Testament at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville Kentucky . I am also the preaching pastor at Clifton Baptist Church . And I will be giving these lectures on Pauline Theology in five hours . <h> I. The Basic Claim <p> When we think of Pauline theology , I think we need to focus on what is most important in Paul 's theology . And the focus , I would argue , is on God and Jesus Christ . Paul 's theology is God-centered and Christ-centered . We think here of Romans 11:36 , speaking of God : " For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . " So , Paul 's theology is focused on God , the One from whom all things come and through whom all things are accomplished . And ultimately all things are for His glory . In Pauline theology God is the center of that theology . <p> But God , in Pauline theology , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ . So it is not as if God and Christ are separate , but God and Christ work together in Paul 's theology . We think here of 1 Corinthians 8 : 6 , where Paul says : " Yet for us , there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things and for whom we exist . " So , all things come from God and all things are for God 's glory . We exist for Him . " And one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and through whom we exist . " So we see there that Paul puts God and Christ together as equally significant and central . <h> a . The Preeminence of Christ <h> 1 . Colossians <p> If we think further about Paul 's theology , we can see that Christ is preeminent in his theology . We think here of Colossians . Christ is the image of God . He reflects who God is . He is the firstborn of all creation . That does not mean that He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the Creator of all . All things are created by Him and for Him ( Col.1:16 ) . But if something is created by Christ , by His agency and for His glory , then Christ is magnified in the creation . He is before all things and in Him all things hold together ( Col.1:17 ) . Christ is the Head of the church ( Col.1:18 ) . So again we see His centrality . He is to be preeminent in everything ( Col.1:19 ) . <p> Paul is dramatically Christ-centered , is n't he ? He says , in thinking about conversion : " As you receive Christ Jesus the Lord , walk in Him " ( Col.2:6 ) . Conversion is receiving Christ as Lord . In Colossians , the false teachers go astray because they do not teach according to Christ . They move their hearers and converts away from Christ . We learn that all the fullness is in Christ and you are complete in Him ( Col.2:9-10 ) . So the only way to completion " the only way to fullness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no other way . Christ is glorified in that the fullness of believers is realized as believers rest in Him . <p> Paul says : " Think on the things above where Christ is " ( Col.3:1 ) . The fullness of God comes when we reflect on Christ . Your life is hidden with Christ in God and Christ is our life ( Col.3:3-4 ) . It is truly stunning , is n't it , how focused on Christ Paul is in his theology ? God is glorified ; God is magnified ; God is lifted up when Christ is central . <h> 2 . Romans <p> Of course , Paul 's probably most full and detailed explanation of his gospel comes in the book of Romans . Paul introduces in that book the gospel of God " the fulfillment of the Old Testament Scriptures . And that gospel , he tells us , is the gospel concerning His Son . What is the good new about ? What does the good news focus on ? The good news focuses on the Son , Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main issue . He is the main person . God has so arranged the history of His saving purposes so that Jesus would be praised . <h> 3 . Galatians <p> In the book of Galatians , we have false teachers who are arguing that believers must obey the law and be circumcised to be saved . That troubles Paul greatly , because it compromises the centrality of Christ and His cross . He argues that if righteousness comes by the law then Christ died for nothing ( Gal.2:21 ) . The problem with the law-based and circumcision-based gospel is that it diminishes the importance of what Christ has done and the importance of Christ 's cross . Galatians 3:1 says : " O foolish Galatians ! Who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly proclaimed as the crucified one ? " So again , the problem with the false-teachers ' gospel is that it does not focus on Christ and His cross . It takes away from the atonement that Jesus has accomplished . <p> The blessing of Abraham , Paul tells us , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed of Abraham and that seed of Abraham is Christ ( Gal.3:16 ) . If one is going to belong to the family of Abraham , one needs to be incorporated in the Christ to belong to Christ . He is the only pathway to the blessing of Abraham . Paul says the law is our pedagogue ( Gal.3:24 ) . The law is our tutor . The law is our guardian until the time of Christ . So the Mosaic Law was meant to be enforced for a certain period of salvation history . And now that Christ has come , we are no longer under the law . All of the Old Testament points to Jesus and climaxes in Him and focuses on Him . <h> 4. 1 Corinthians <p> We see the same thing in 1 Corinthians . We see the centrality of God and Christ in Corinth . The Corinthians have gone astray because they have forgotten about Christ and Him crucified . That is the message that Paul teaches in 1 Corinthians 1:17-18 . He proclaims the word of the cross . He preaches Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us will boast only in the Lord ( 1:23 ) . We are not to boast in ourselves and what we have accomplished and our obedience to the law " our wisdom , our might , our strength . But God has chosen us in Christ for salvation so that we would boast only in the Lord and not boast in anything or anyone else . Paul says : " I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified " ( 1 Cor.2:3 ) . The message of the cross is the message of Christ crucified and His great work . <h> 5 . Philippians <p> What I am arguing here , over and over again , is the centrality of Christ in Paul 's theology . And I am just showing you this in a lot of verses . In the book of Philippians , Paul rejoices when people preach Christ ( 1:18 ) " the joy of the proclamation of Jesus Christ . Paul says : " For me to live is Christ and to die is gain " ( 1:21 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paul 's theology is Jesus Christ , because to live , Paul says , is Christ and to die is gain . Nothing is more important for Paul than Jesus Christ and to live for His glory and praise and honor . In fact , the greatest thing for Paul would be to die , because if he were to die he would be with Christ and that is his goal . That is his longing . <h> 6. 2 Corinthians <p> All of God 's promises ( now I am moving to 2 Corinthians ) , all of God 's promises are " yes and amen in Christ " ( 2 Cor.1:20 ) . Again , we see the centrality of Jesus in that all the Old Testament climaxes in Him . All the Old Testament points to Him and finds its fulfillment in Him . We also see that the glory of Christ outshines the glory of Moses and the law ( 2 Cor.3:10-11 ) . There was glory in the giving of the law and on the face of Moses . But the glory of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like the glory of the sun and the glory of Moses is like the glory of the moon . There was glory on Moses ' face , but the glory of Christ exceeds Moses ' glory . And it shines brighter and truer so the glory of Moses always pointed to Christ and His glory so that He would receive the praise and honor forever . <p> That fits with 2 Corinthians 2:4-6 . There Paul speaks of the God of this world ( Satan ) , who has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing what ? To keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ . What unbelievers do not see is that Christ is glorious " that He is beautiful ; that He is wonderful . Satan blinds unbelievers from seeing that . So they think Christ is not exciting or glorious or beautiful or the reason for living . Satan blinds people from seeing that . <p> The glory of Christ who is the image of God " we already saw that in Colossians , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For what we proclaim is not ourselves . " And that is true of all of us as Christian ministers . We do not proclaim ourselves , do we ? We do not proclaim our own wisdom and strength . We are weak and sinful in and of ourselves . " But we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord , with ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake . " So God calls us not to proclaim ourselves and our wisdom and our might , but Jesus . <p> And then we see in 2 Corinthians 4:6 " " For God , who said let light shine out of darkness . " And where did God say that ? God said that in Genesis 1:3 , did n't He ? It was on the first day of creation . Where the world is covered with darkness , God said let the light shine out of that darkness . Let it blaze out of that darkness . But now He has shown in our hearts to get the light of the knowledge of the glory of God . So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the face of Jesus Christ . Verse 4 spoke of the glory of Christ . Now Paul speaks of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . So , we see again that God 's glory is maximized " God 's glory is manifested ; God 's glory is realized " in Jesus Christ ( in the face of Jesus Christ ) . <h> b . The Glory of God and the Glory of Christ <p> In 1 Corinthians 10:31 , we read that we are to do all things to the glory of God , whether we eat or drink or whatever we do . We are to do it for the glory of God . But doing those things for the glory of God does not cancel out the glory of Christ . We read in Colossians 3:17 " the Father through Him . " So , we read in 1 Corinthians 10:31 that whether we eat or drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the glory of God . But another way of saying the same thing is what we find in Colossians 3 : 17 " whatever we do , whether it is in word , whether it is in speech or action , we are to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through Him . So , do everything for the glory of God . Another way of saying that is to do everything in the name of Jesus . We see again that Jesus is maximized " Jesus is praised ; Jesus is honored " when God is glorified . There is no conflict between the glory of God and the glory of Jesus . <h> 1 . The Failure to Honor God is the Root Problem <p> In Romans 1:18-25 ( we will see this again later ) , what is root sin ? The root sin is the failure to give glory to God . The failure to honor and praise and esteem God as we should , that is the very heart of sin . Sin detracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be God-centered , to rely on Him . Romans 14:23 says : " Whatever is not of faith is sin . " So sin is a failure to trust God in everything . In Romans 4:19 , we see that faith gives glory to God , trusting that His word is reliable . Sin is a failure to trust God . Whatever is not of faith is sin . Sin is a failure to see that God is strong . Sin is a failure to believe that He will do what He promised . The root issue in all of life is always : Are we glorifying and honoring God ? Sin does not glorify and honor God , because it does not view Him as trustworthy . Sin does not believe that God would satisfy us . Sin looks to other gods to protect us and satisfy us and keep us safe . But faith glorifies God by trusting Him to protect us and Him alone and not looking to any other idols or any other helps or any other totems or fetishes , but only trusting in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money or our reputations , but only in God . <h> 2 . Honoring God with our Bodies <p> In 1 Corinthians 6 , Paul talks about the need to be sexually pure and not to commit sexual sin . Obviously , we see in Scripture that we are only to engage in sexual relations when we are married , with our spouse . So we glorify God with our bodies ( 1 Cor.6 ) . We glorify God with our bodies by doing with our bodies what God has commanded us to do , and not sinning against Him and doing what He has forbidden us to do . <h> 3 . Honoring God with our Money <p> In Philippians 4 , we see that we glorify God with our money when we give as He has commanded us . When we are generous , we glorify God . When we trust Him , we can help others who are in need . Because Paul says : " And my God will supply every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus " ( Phil.4:19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we glorify Him in the midst of this by giving our money to others . We trust that God will supply our needs . And since He has promised to supply our needs , we generously give to others and we do not hoard money for ourselves . That is in Philippians 4. <h> 4 . Honoring God in our Relationships <p> Romans 15:7 says we are to glorify God by accepting one another " by loving one another ; by receiving one another ; by having fellowship with one another . In Ephesians 5:22 and following , where Paul speaks of the relationship between husbands and wives , he emphasizes that we do everything in Christ . We do everything in the Lord . We do everything to bring Him praise and honor and glory . Wives do not just submit to husbands because it is the right thing to do and husbands do not merely love their wives and sacrifice for them because it is the right thing to do . It is the right thing to do , but we do so because it glorifies and honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 5 . Finding our Satisfaction in God <p> In Romans 5:11 , where Paul speaks of the great salvation we have received , he ends by saying we boast in God in Jesus Christ . We exalt in God " we find our satisfaction in God ; we glorify God " by enjoying Him . We glorify God by finding Him to be our all in all . We glorify God by exalting in Him " boasting in Him ; rejoicing in Him . So , glorifying God is not just an abstract idea . It is something practical and useful for our everyday lives . <h> c . God 's Great Work for us in Christ <p> In Ephesians 1:3-14 , Paul speaks of the great work that is done for us by God . God has elected us before the foundation of the world to be saved . God has redeemed us . God has disclosed the plan of all of salvation history in Christ . God has given us of His Spirit . But what he says over and over again is : He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can just read those verses and see over and over that what God has done , He has done for us in Christ . So again , Christ is the focus in those verses . <p> Maybe I should read some of those . He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places . He chose us in Christ , in Him ( Eph.1:4 ) . We are to be holy and blameless before Him . He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ ( 1:5 ) . He blessed in the beloved , who is Jesus Christ ( 1:6 ) . In Christ , we have redemption ( 1:7 ) . The mystery of His will He set forth in Christ ( 1:9 ) . The plan for all the fullness of time was to unite all things in Christ ( 1:10 ) . In Him , we have an inheritance in Christ ( 1:11 ) . He speaks of those who hope in Christ ( 1:12 ) . In Him , we were sealed with the Spirit ( 1:13 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very central in the book of Ephesians and in these first verses . <p> We see later on in the chapter that Christ rules over all authority and power . If you will look at the one to come . And He put all things under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church which is His body , the fullness of Him who fills all in all . " So Christ rules over all demonic powers , over all angels , over all things . He is the Sovereign One . <p> We see also Ephesians 2:7 the centrality of God and Christ . It says there that God 's whole plan in the history of salvation is that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what will we be doing through all eternity ? We will be praising God for the immeasurable riches of His grace that He showed us in Christ . We already saw in chapter 1 that all of salvation history is united in Christ . God 's whole plan was to focus on Christ . And so here we see the riches of God 's grace in Christ is what we will praise for all of eternity . We will be focusing on what God has done for us . God 's salvation is described in Ephesians 3:8 as the unsearchable riches of Christ . And through the church God 's manifold wisdom is made known ( 3:10 ) . The rulers and authorities and the demons will see God 's great saving purposes that have been accomplished in Jesus Christ . So , you can see how crucial Christ is. <h> d . Spreading the Knowledge of Christ <p> Paul 's whole goal is to bring the knowledge of Christ to others . And I think it is helpful for us to see then , when we think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's goal is to bring the knowledge of Christ to others , especially to the Gentiles . Paul 's joy in life and the joy of all in ministry is to spread the knowledge of Christ to others . <h> 1 . Paul 's Testimony of Conversion <p> He emphasizes , does n't he , in his letters that he was unworthy ? We think of 1 Corinthians 15:9 and following and 1 Timothy 1:12 and following and Ephesians 3:1 and following . Paul emphasizes that , as a missionary , he was unworthy . Because he persecuted the church of God , he was not worthy to be a missionary . But God had called him . God 's grace had worked in him . On the Damascus Road , God summoned Paul to faith in Jesus Christ . And he summoned him to be the apostle to the Gentiles . <p> That is very clear , is n't it , in the book of Galatians " that God 's supernatural work is what changed Paul ? We see in Galatians 1:11 " " For I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is not man 's gospel . " Paul did not preach a human gospel . He did not receive it from any man ( 1:12 ) . No man explained the gospel to him " " nor was I taught it , but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ . " Jesus Christ appeared to him on the Damascus Road . " You have heard of my former life in Judaism , how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it . " Before Paul was converted , he tried to rule out the Christian faith and opposed it violently . And he was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age , among my own people , so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers . Paul was a very ardent Jew and observant of the law , before he was saved . But God intervened , did n't he ? And God turned him around . We see in verse 18 : " But when He would set me apart before I was born " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born to be an apostle . And he called Paul by His grace . Again , that is on the Damascus Road . <p> What can account for Paul 's conversion ? He was absolutely convinced , was n't he , that Jesus Christ was not the Messiah ? He was convinced that Jesus was a pretender . And therefore he persecuted the church and tried to destroy it . He was absolutely convinced that he was right . But he understood , did n't he , that he was dramatically wrong ? And he was turned around by God 's grace . When God called him , God was pleased to reveal His Son to Paul supernaturally on the Damascus Road " when Jesus Christ appeared to him and spoke to him and commissioned him to be an apostle . And He did so , so that he would share the good news with Gentiles " the good news of the gospel . His call to apostleship was supernatural , even when he was unworthy . <h> 2 . Paul 's Testimony of his Missionary Goal <p> Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that in Romans 1:14-15 , Colossians 1:25 and 1 Corinthians 9 . That was the passion of his life : to preach the gospel . And we know that he endured persecution and difficulty and suffering and people attacked him for his apostleship . This was no easy matter . Paul did not live a comfortable life , but he was willing to suffer all things for the sake of the gospel " for proclaiming the gospel and for bringing it to others . <p> It took extraordinary effort . We read about it in Colossians 1:28-2:3 . And we know that it was plagued by suffering . We read in 2 Corinthians 11 all of the difficulties that Paul experienced . The proclamation of the gospel was no easy task , but for Paul it was a joyous task because that is what God had called him to do . And he imitates Christ . He is not Christ , of course . But he imitates Christ in that he also endures suffering . Only Christ 's death is atoning and brings forgiveness of sins . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Paul 's suffering does replicate Christ to some extent . It is the means by which the message of the gospel goes out to others , so that others can be included in God 's saving purposes . <p> So , the message of the gospel " the suffering that Paul undergoes as one who is called and converted on the Damascus Road " that message of the gospel is shown to be precious precisely because Paul suffers . His suffering shows the preciousness of the gospel and that he is willing to give all so that the gospel would go forth . <h> 3 . Paul 's Testimony to the Gentiles <p> The other interesting thing about Paul is Paul is called to be an apostle to the Gentiles . We might think with Paul 's Jewish background and training in the Scriptures and his work as a Pharisee that God would call him to be an apostle to the Jews . But God is sovereign . God chose Paul and called Paul and elected Paul to bring the gospel , not to the Jews , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the earth . Paul says in Romans 15:16 that he has a sort of priestly call to bring this gospel to the Gentiles . And that is an issue that Paul often defends in his letter " that the gospel is bringing the good news to the Gentiles . <p> As a Jew he must defend the bringing of the gospel to the Gentiles . He must show that this is theologically right , because some of the Jews believe that the good news was only for them . They believed that it was restricted to a single people group . And Paul wants to make clear that that is not the case . The gospel is for all people " not only the Jews , but also to the Gentiles . The gospel goes to the very ends of the earth and it can not be restricted only to the Jewish people . Paul has to theologically defend that , of course . And he does that . He shows that the inclusion of the Gentiles is a fulfillment of God 's saving purposes . <p> Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not part of God 's covenant people . That is very clear in Ephesians . Previously the Gentiles are the uncircumcised . They are outside God 's covenant . They are separated from Christ ( Eph.2:12 ) . They are alienated from the commonwealth of Israel . They are not part of Israel . They are not part of Christ . They are strangers to the saving covenants of promise . They have no hope , no salvation and they are without God in the world . That was the state of the Gentiles before the coming of Christ . Paul does not view them as being saved . <p> But it is so important to share the glory and beauty of God in Christ , because it is necessary for salvation and for knowing Christ and loving Christ and serving Christ . It is all , for Paul , about Christ . And now , in Christ Jesus , the Gentiles are near . They are no longer separated from God 's promises through the cross of Christ if they put their faith in Him . Paul does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he argues instead that the enmity between Jews and Gentiles is removed in the cross of Christ . The Gentiles are not automatically saved now that Christ has come . They need to be reconciled to God in Christ . They need to know about what Christ has done for them , and that is why Paul engages in missions . Missions is so important because it focuses on what Christ has done and brings Him all the glory and honor . And that good news is shared through him . <p> We think here of Colossians 1 . This is the passion of Paul 's life : the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations , but is now revealed to His saints . And that is the riches of the glory of Christ being in you . And that was the passion of Paul 's life . Paul was willing to suffer and die so that Gentiles " those who did not know Christ , those who were separated from Christ " would come to know Him and would be saved and would experience God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to share the riches of Christ . Paul was willing to give his life for it . <h> 4 . Paul 's Testimony about the Necessity for Gospel Preaching <p> A very important verse in this regard is Romans 10:14 where Paul says : How then will they " how will anyone " call on Him in whom they will not have believed . Paul has just said in the previous verse that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . But how do you call on the name of the Lord , he says in Romans 10:14 , unless you believe ? You only call on someone in whom you believe . And how are they to believe in Him of whom they have never heard ? They will not believe in Christ if they have not heard of Him . That is why it is absolutely essential to preach the gospel . Those who are saved are only those who believe . And those who believe are only those who have heard . And how can someone hear ? Well , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are they to hear without someone preaching ? If there is not preaching , they do not hear . The message must be proclaimed through a preacher . And how are they to preach unless they are sent ? Unless someone goes and preaches they will not hear . And they can only believe if they hear . And they will only call if they believe . <p> And so it is so important , is n't it , to hear the gospel ? Paul says , so faith comes from , what ? Hearing . Faith comes from hearing the gospel , and hearing through the word about Christ " the word of the gospel . So , the preaching of the gospel is absolutely crucial and fundamental because , if the Gentiles have not heard this word , they are not saved . They are outside of God 's purposes . <p> We read in Romans 1 that the wrath of God is poured out on the Gentiles who have seen the revelation of God through nature . They have seen God as powerful and they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they have rejected that revelation . They have turned away from God and worshipped idols . They have worshipped the creature rather than the Creator . They have worshipped stone and wood and statues and images and animals and the sun and the moon , rather than worshipping God in Christ . So they are without excuse . Paul does not give any indication , does he , that the revelation that comes through nature saves ? The only thing that saves is the gospel and trusting in Christ and believing in Christ and resting in Christ and knowing Christ . And therefore that is why it is so important that the gospel of Christ is proclaimed , because without it the Gentiles are apart from Christ and separate from God 's saving promises . And therefore it is very crucial , is n't it , to preach the gospel to those who have not heard it , just as the Apostle Paul did , because faith comes from hearing . And just as Paul did that in his day , so we do today . We proclaim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ . <p> So , this is a mystery , Paul says in Ephesians 3:6 and Colossians 1:27 , that was not revealed in the Old Testament . A mystery is something that was previously secret , but has now been revealed . It is something that was previously hidden , but is now made known . That mystery is that Jews and Gentiles are now united in Christ through the gospel . That mystery is that when Gentiles believe , they are part of the people of God . They are part of what God is doing in Christ . So now there is not a separation between Jews and Gentiles . But Gentiles who believe the gospel and trust in it are saved and united with the Jews in one people of God . So that is a part of Paul 's ministry as well as to bring this good news to the Gentiles of unity in Christ . So , Paul 's desire is to bring this gospel to the ends of the earth , from Jerusalem to Illyricum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must hear the gospel of Jesus Christ to be saved , if only the gospel saves and nothing else , then Paul is very passionate about bringing this gospel to the ends of the earth . <h> 5 . Paul 's Summons to Pray for Mission <p> And he summons people to pray for his mission . 2 Thessalonians 3:1 " " Pray that the word of the Lord would run and be glorified . " In Colossians 4:2-3 " " Pray for him to have wisdom to spread the message in boldness . " And , of course , that is still true today . We pray that the message of the word would be spread . The way the gospel is hindered is if that word is not proclaimed to all peoples in all segments . So one of the ways Satan works today is by hindering the preaching and spreading of the gospel to all peoples . So we are to pray that the word would be unleashed , because the power is in the word of the gospel . And when that word is spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross that we already saw in 1 Corinthians 2 . <p> Remember , faith comes from hearing the word of the gospel . We saw that in Romans 10:17 or in Galatians 3:2 . The Galatians receive the Spirit by hearing the message of the gospel with faith . So , how do people receive the Spirit ? It is by hearing the message that message goes forth . So , Paul as a missionary would plant churches wherever he went . We see that in 1 Corinthians 3 . He would lay a foundation , as he says . That foundation is Christ and Him crucified . He would give birth , so to speak ( 1 Cor.4:15 ) , to a new congregation . He would betroth them . <h> 6 . Paul 's Call to Persevere <p> And he would emphasize that those new converts not only need to believe initially , but they need to persevere ( 1 Thess.3:1-10 ) . Paul knows that they are really Christians " that they really received the gospel , that they truly believe " when persecution came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on people again and again to stand in the Lord . Philippians 4:1 " to hold fast the word . If we do not hold fast the word , Paul says , my work is in vain . They need to continue to believe . Paul can summarize his mission in Romans 1:5 and Romans 16:26 as " the obedience of faith " . It is not just the initial call to believe , but it is the continuing to believe that is the evidence that we have truly believed . He calls on the believers in Philippians 1:27 to " live worthily of the gospel " . Or in 1 Corinthians 15 he calls them to stay true to the gospel to the end , so that they do not fall short of the power of the gospel of Christ " so that they keep believing the message they first embraced . <p> Paul emphasizes that the power is in the gospel ( Rom.1:16 ) . He is not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God resulting in salvation to everyone who believes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes ( Col.1:6 ) . We saw this just a moment ago , did n't we ? The power is in the word . Satan wants the word not to go forth . So we are to pray that the word would run and be glorified , because the gospel has an inherent power . Wherever it goes , it bears fruit and increases . Hence Paul 's great desire to see the gospel spread . <p> And , of course , Paul has other people who work with him , like Euodias and Syntyche , two women who spread the gospel ( Phil.4:2-3 ) , probably especially amongst women . There are other evangelists . <p> And , of course , the gospel is attractive to people when there is moral excellence in the lives of believers as well . When believers live as the children of light , we see in Ephesians 5:7 and following , that commends the gospel to others . When people live in a wise and godly way with outsiders , they commend the gospel to them . The gospel is shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is pleasing to God . We see that as well in Titus 2:1-10 . When believers live out their lives in a godly way that is pleasing to God , then unbelievers take notice and they are attracted to the gospel of Christ . <h> II . Conclusion <p> We need to remember what we started with today . And that is the gospel is to be proclaimed for the glory of God and Christ . We see that in Romans 1:5 , do n't we ? It is the glory of Christ that is the purpose of the gospel . We are to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of His name among all the nations . We do this for the sake of His name " for the honor and glory of Jesus ' name . We do this , as Romans 16:25-27 says , to bring glory to the only wise God . The gospel is spread to bring glory to Him . <p> We see in Philippians 2 that , at the name of Jesus , every knee will bow in heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father . That is what animates our mission : bringing glory to God and seeing God honored and praised . And that is why Paul is willing to suffer . That is why he is willing to endure such difficulty . It is for the comfort and strength of believers . It is for the salvation of others . The treasure of the gospel is in earthen vessels because it commends the glory of Christ . The sufferings of Paul 's ministry show that the strength is in Christ , as we see in 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 . Christ is strong and Paul is weak . That shows that Christ is glorious . <p> Paul as a minister , is a prisoner for the sake of the Gentiles . He does it for their glory . He endures all his suffering ( 2 Tim.2:10 ) for the sake of the elect . In Colossians 1 , he fills up Christ 's afflictions to fulfill the word of God " to advance the gospel so that God would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paul 's theology . It is the glory of God in Christ . It is God being magnified in Christ and honored in Christ and praised in Christ . And that is why Paul engages in ministry , so others will know Christ and love Him and serve Him and follow Him forever .

Humanity&amp;#39 ; s Origin : God the Creator of Human Beings == <p> The Bible is clear that God created all that is . The Bible begins with this in Genesis 1:1 , &amp;quot ; In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . &amp;quot ; Of course , that is comprehensive and , by implication , that includes human beings . Yet , it&amp;#39 ; s very clear that , in Genesis 1 and 2 , special priority is given to the creation of human beings . <p> == A. Special Place for the Formation of Humanity == <p> There is a special place for the formation of humanity , as can be seen by a number of factors as you look through chapters 1 and 2 of Genesis . Just the terminology used of the formation and creation of humanity is interesting . The word ' ' bara ' ' , that is used in Genesis 1:1 , &amp;quot ; In the beginning God **26;0;TOOLONG the heavens and the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , of male and female , in the image of God in verse 27 . This term is a term that is always used in the Old Testament with God as its subject . God is the one who , ' ' bara ' ' , creates . It is used here to indicate the distinctive work of God in doing this . Notice , too , the shift in the language used of the formation of man in Genesis 2:7 , &amp;quot ; God **25;28;TOOLONG the man from the dust of the ground . &amp;quot ; The term used here is a term that communicates the notion of shaping or molding in a particular way , whereas in Genesis 2:22 , &amp;quot ; The Lord God **28;55;TOOLONG into a woman the rib which He had taken , &amp;quot ; the word could be translated as &amp;quot ; built . &amp;quot ; It carries the notion of a very organized and designed project that is constructed . These terms that are used of the formation of the man and the woman indicate design , purpose , and intent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms that are used , that the language changes in Genesis 1 . As we have read earlier , in the other days , the other parts of creation , &amp;quot ; God said , &amp;quot ; and &amp;quot ; God said , &amp;quot ; and &amp;quot ; God said , &amp;quot ; and then various parts of creation would come into being . When we come to verse 26 , it is &amp;quot ; God said , &amp;#39 ; Let us make man in our image according to our likeness . &amp;#39 ; &amp;quot ; There is this sense of deliberation that is communicated in the formation of man . Notice , of course , the obvious inclusion in the creation of man and woman , that they are created in God&amp;#39 ; s image . We will talk more about that in a moment , but that is stressed in both verse 26 and 27 ; man and woman are created in the image of God . One last item , just to indicate the special place that the creation of humanity has in this account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter 1 , that is given full play or , as it were , the movie version . In chapter 2 , that gets expanded for us so we can understand the creation of first the man and his obligations to the garden , and then the creation of the woman to be the helper to him . Clearly , God isolates out , separates out the creation of man as the most significant part of creation , the last created act in the sixth day . It is the very end of the created purpose of God , after which it says , &amp;quot ; He looked at all that he had made , and behold , it was very good , &amp;quot ; ( Genesis 1:31 ) . Clearly , there is a special place for the formation of humanity . <p> == B. Brief Theology of Humanity&amp;#39 ; s Creation by God == <p> Let me just itemize for us real quickly five things that would indicate a theology of humanity&amp;#39 ; s creation by God <p> === 1 . God is ultimate , while all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to overestimate how important this is . We need to realize that we owe everything to God who was our Creator . Our very design , to live as the human beings he created us to be , is owing to God&amp;#39 ; s design . We are not the byproduct of chance processes that just happened to end up the way we are . No , we were shaped and formed and made by God , and our dependence upon Him is absolute . God is ultimate . He is the one who receives all the glory for all of His creation , including the creation of humanity , and we need to acknowledge our wholehearted dependence upon him . <p> === 2 . Humanity owes God obedience , loyalty , and worship . === <p> Now why is that ? It is simply because He owns us . To create is to own and to own is to have the right to rule . So , God , as Creator and Owner of us , then requires our obedience to Him . This is not an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obligation , from the very first instant of humanity&amp;#39 ; s existence , to give to God their obedience , loyalty , and worship . We truly are made to bring glory to God and to acknowledge Him as our source and provider ; the one to whom we owe everything . <p> === 3 . Humanity , as created by God , was entirely ( body and soul ) good . === <p> In the western tradition in theology there has been a tendency to diminish the importance of the body and exalt the importance of the soul . In biblical theology this just is not accurate . God intentionally made both body and soul . He told the man and the woman , before sin occurred , that their mandate was to reproduce . In other words , sexual relations were designed by God and are part of the created order . Certainly they are marred because of sin , no question about that . The point is , our sexuality , our bodies , as well as our souls are created by God and are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God intended in creating us . <p> To none of the rest of creation does God give a moral commandment , as He does to the man in the garden , when He says to him , &amp;quot ; Of all the trees you may freely eat , but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not eat of it , for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die , &amp;quot ; ( Genesis 2:15-17 ) . It sets up , right at the very beginning , the moral imperative that humanity must realize they are required by God to obey . But , they are given a kind of freedom in which they may obey or not . So , they must use this gift of moral freedom in a way that would bring God glory and themselves blessing , rather than to bring harm and destruction to themselves . The whole history of the human race shows how these two tracks are followed , either of obedience or disobedience , as our moral freedom is expressed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes and yet a differentiation in the creation of the man and the woman . === <p> It is very clear , in Genesis 1 that God created both male and female in the image of God . Both share together a common , equal humanity , equal personhood , equal dignity , equal respect for one another . Yet , man is man , not woman ; woman is woman , not man . God intended for there to be created differences between man as man and woman as woman , even though both are equally human . Those differences include , among other things , an establishment , in the very Garden of Eden itself , of an authority or a male headship that was given to the man , while the woman was created to be the helper , the helpmeet , for the man . We will perhaps be able to talk a bit more about this later , but this understanding is called a complementarian view . The woman complements the man as she comes into being , and she comes to help fulfill what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal in their personhood and human essence , and yet different in the roles that each is designed and commanded to carry out , with male headship being a part of the very created order . <p> == II . Humanitys Constitution == <p> Here is just a brief sketch of some of these issues that are involved in the question of how we are made up as human beings . What is the parts list of a human being ? Are we made up of one thing or two things or three things ? We see that theologians have differed on this . <p> == A. Theories on the Structure of Human Nature . == <p> There are really three main views that have been proposed , and still are being advocated , by various groups of people . <p> === 1 . Monism. === <p> The monist view is simply the view that we are one thing , a body/soul unity . When we read in the Bible of our heart , or our body , or our soul , or various parts of us , these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that there really is no legitimacy to distinguishing separable parts of the human being . One advocate of this view , G. C. Berkouwer , a Dutch theologian , has argued that , if we divide the human being into body and sou , l it can result in either a depreciation of one or the other . In fact , we ought to keep the two together . My own view is that there is an interrelation of body and soul that is undeniable and must be recognized and , in fact , has very many practical implications . On the other hand , I think that the question of whether the body and soul are separable from one another requires other data from Scripture . This is especially true , as I&amp;#39 ; ll mention in a moment , with the doctrine of the intermediate state , which talks about what happens right at the point at which a person dies . It seems to me that this is where the monist view breaks down . Scripture seems to be very clear that our bodies go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , continue to live , as we either go to the presence of the Lord or go to a place of judgment or torment , awaiting the final judgment . <p> === 2 . Dichotomy . === <p> This view has a long tradition ; it goes back to Tertullian . The first major defense of this view is Tertullian&amp;#39 ; s Treatise on the Soul . It really is the predominant view through the history of the church . It is the view I favor . I believe Scripture weighs in for this view and expounds this view in ways that I find problematic in the others . Essentially , the dichotomist view argues that we are made up of two things , two parts as it were , material and immaterial . You could call them body and soul if you wish . It does seem as though Scripture supports the notion that the intermediate state is true . For example , Jesus says to the thief on the cross , in Luke 23:43 , &amp;quot ; Truly I say to you , today you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , among other things , that while the body of that thief on the cross will go to a grave , the soul , the thief himself , as it were , the inner person , will go to be with Christ in paradise . So , it is difficult to see how a monist view could be true . Or , for example , in Philippians 1:21-24 where Paul wishes &amp;quot ; to depart and be with Christ for that would be better , yet to remain on in the flesh , &amp;quot ; in other words , my bodily existence &amp;quot ; is necessary for your sake . &amp;quot ; Obviously , Paul considers this to be a very important step in life , as it were . When you die , you go to be with Christ . Or , the way he puts it in 2 Corinthians 5:8 , &amp;quot ; Absent from the body , present with the Lord . &amp;quot ; The argument for the intermediate state , I think , is very strong and compelling and indicates , at least , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we will talk about in a moment , trichotomy , three parts ? It looks as though the language of the Bible speaks of soul and spirit as basically interchangeable . It&amp;#39 ; s hard to see that there is any significant , consistent difference between the two . Let me give you just a couple of examples . In Luke 1:46-47 , notice the parallelism where Mary says , &amp;quot ; My soul exalts the Lord and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. &amp;quot ; There it looks very clear that spirit and soul are being used virtually synonymously in this parallelism , this sort of Hebrew parallelism , that we find in this passage . The same kind of thing is echoed in an Old Testament passage , Isaiah 26:9 , &amp;quot ; My soul longs for thee , my spirit seeks thee earnestly . &amp;quot ; Again , the parallelism indicates a very close similarity in soul and spirit ; they are basically used interchangeably or synonymously . I don&amp;#39 ; t think a strong case can be made for separating soul and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point number three . <p> === 3 . Trichotomy. === <p> The trichotomy view holds that there are three substances , body , soul , and spirit . Of course , they agree with the dichotomists that the intermediate state requires something more than a monist view . They differ , though , with the dichotomists in arguing that what is really required is , in fact , a trichotomist view , that there are three parts . One of their main texts for arguing this is 1 Thessalonians 5:23 which says , &amp;quot ; May your spirit , soul , and body be preserved complete at the revelation of Jesus Christ . &amp;quot ; There they say , &amp;quot ; Well , it looks as though Paul is indicating three parts of us . May all of you be preserved complete , namely your spirit , soul , and body . &amp;quot ; The other verse that they site is Hebrews 4:12 , where the Word of God is spoken of as &amp;quot ; piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit , joints and marrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide soul and spirit would seem to indicate that these are separable . Let me give a quick response to both of these . First , in the 1 Thessalonians 5 passage , when Paul says , &amp;quot ; May your spirit , soul , and body be preserved complete , &amp;quot ; surely he is saying , &amp;quot ; all of who you are , may all of who you are be preserved complete at the revelation of Jesus Christ&amp;quot ; . But , there are other places in Scripture , most notably the Great Commandment where all of who you are does not include the spirit . I find this just remarkable . For example , in Matthew 22:37 , Mark 12:30 , Luke 10:27 , these are the Great Commandment passages ; &amp;quot ; Love the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , mind , strength , &amp;quot ; no mention of spirit . I think we should conclude then that in neither the Great Commandment passage nor 1 Thessalonians 5:23 , do we have a parts list . I think both are meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us clear indication of there being separate soul and spirit . Hebrews 4:12 says that , &amp;quot ; The Word of God pierces as far as the division of soul and spirit&amp;quot ; . The very next phrase is , &amp;quot ; and of joints and marrow&amp;quot ; . Who is going to say that joints and marrow are separable substances ? Rather , joints and marrow are two aspects of one thing , two aspects of a body , of a physical entity . I think the same thing could be said of soul and spirit , two aspects of one entity . Therefore , I don&amp;#39 ; t think the main biblical arguments for trichotomy are compelling . My own view , then , is that the dichotomy view is in all likelihood the one that Scripture commends most , although both the dichotomy and trichotomy view are held by a number of very prominent evangelical Christians , and both are viable views . The monist view , I think , is the one that is the most troubling , because of its difficulty in handling passages that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Soul . == <p> We move now to the question of the transmission of the soul . Here , there are two main views that have been argued for the question of how it is that we become human beings with souls , with an immaterial part . Surely , the material part of us has come about because of the process of biological reproduction that God established at the very beginning . A man and a woman have sexual relations and they conceive a child and biologically that child has its body as a result of the reproductive process . How is it , though , that this little one , who we call a human being , has a soul ? How does this happen ? There are two main views on this . <p> === 1 . Creationism. === <p> Don&amp;#39 ; t confuse this with creationism as it relates to the broader question of how God created the heavens and the earth and the timing for that and so on . This is not creation versus evolution . This is a particular view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The creationist view , held in Reformed and Roman Catholic traditions , in particular , argues that God creates each soul separately and puts it into , joins it with , a human body at some point between conception and birth . Different creationists will vary on when this happens . Some hold that it happens at birth , so before that point you have a human body but not a human soul . In fact , President Clinton , back when he was in first installed into office , supported his view of abortion by appeal to this doctrine . If ensoulment , as it is called , does not take place until the baby takes its own breath , the soul does not come into it until birth , then it is not a human being before that . Most in the Reformed tradition have argued that ensoulment takes place at conception . Certainly , if you hold this view , you must agree that it is an enormous risk to abort one who may , in fact , be a human being with a soul , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being . This is not the view I hold , but if you do hold this creationist view , I would encourage you , knowing that we can not be dogmatic on when ensoulment takes place , to err on the side of caution . When you are hunting , if you see a bush move , you don&amp;#39 ; t shoot . It may be a hunter ; it may be a human being . Likewise , the fetus may be a human being at the very point of conception , and certainly we should treat the fetus as a human being with respect to its right to life and treat it as such . <p> === 2 . Traducianism. === <p> The traducian view comes from a Latin word ' ' traduco ' ' , which simply means , &amp;quot ; to carry over . &amp;quot ; Traducianism holds the view that the soul , as well as the body , are carried over or brought forward from the human parents . In other words , this view holds that , as God developed the reproductive process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual reproduction , to conceive not just human bodies but whole human persons . Really , if this view is true , and it is the view I favor , I believe there is some compelling reason for holding it ; it really does make sexual intercourse for the purpose of procreation a sacred event . It is remarkable when you think of what happens as a husband and a wife engage in sexual relations and conceive a child . What happens is that they become , as it were , co-creators with God . They are the ones to whom God has given the privilege , from this point on , to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth with their kind . In fact , one of the arguments for this view is that , in the book of Genesis , the various species are said to reproduce after their kind . Bears produce bears , not just biologically , but everything that they are ; elephants produce elephants ; fish produce fish . Well , human beings produce human beings , that is , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed . It may be one of the reasons that God has made the sexual act of human beings to be the extraordinary experience that it is . Maybe God wishes to convey by this the joy and the exaltation he has in the formation of human beings , who are his image , so he grants to human beings the privilege of sharing in that creative process . <p> What is presented in argument for this view ? One thing that is noted is the fact that , in Genesis 1 , both man and woman are created in the image of God . Then , when they have a child , that child is created in the image of the man . If you look in Genesis 5:3 we read , &amp;quot ; Adam lived 130 years and he became the father of a son in his own likeness , &amp;quot ; this is referring to Seth , &amp;quot ; and according to his image , and he named him Seth . &amp;quot ; Isn&amp;#39 ; t that interesting , that man and woman are created in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is born , as it were , in the image of Adam , who was the image of God ? So , it looks as though our image of God status has come down a long line of parents , grandparents , great grandparents . You would back it all the way up to the original pair , Adam and Eve , and realize that the image of God is passed on through this . <p> Another reason for holding this view is that , in the Old and New Testaments , you find descendents as being spoken of as &amp;quot ; in the loins of their ancestors . &amp;quot ; You can see this in Genesis 46:26 and Hebrews 7:9-10 . Levi paid tithes to Melchizedek , we are told in Hebrews . How did that happen ? Levi was born many , many years later . He did that as Abraham ; he was in the loins of his father Abraham . So you see , this idea that Levi&amp;#39 ; s very existence comes out of Abraham seems to indicate more than simply physical bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must move ahead . The traducian view does account better , it seems to me , for not only biological similarities between parents and children , but also emotional , psychological , and dispositional similarities between parents and children . This is even in cases where children are separated from their parents at birth , say through adoption or some other means . Studies have shown that those biological children often times share in characteristics of their parents that aren&amp;#39 ; t accounted for by their environment . This indicates a continuity of the whole person between parents and children . <p> == III . The Image of God == <p> I&amp;#39 ; ll just acknowledge at the very beginning , that this is a very interesting and complicated area and we have only a very short time to develop a few of the main ideas . But , I hope it will be helpful in understanding the significance and the value that God has invested in human beings as His image . Everybody agrees that &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; in Genesis 1:26-27 is significant . The text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Then God said , &amp;#39 ; Let us make man in our image according to our likeness . Let them rule over the fish of the sea , the birds of the sky , over the cattle in all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the female he created them . &amp;quot ; Clearly , &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; is meant by the author of Genesis to indicate something significant , but , here is the problem . In the history of this doctrine it is just not clear what the significance is ; there have been disagreements . Three main views have been proposed . <p> == A. Major Understandings of &amp;quot ; Image of God&amp;quot ; == <p> === 1 . Structural Understanding . === <p> This has been the most prominent view . This is simply the view that something about our makeup , our constitution or our structure is what accounts for our being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in the second century , argued that the image of God is our reason and volition , but the likeness of God was something different , our holiness . As a result , the likeness of God is lost in the fall and regained in redemption , but we all have the image of God because of our capacity of reason and volition . Augustine understood the image of God as the reflection of the Triune persons of God mirrored in the distinct , yet unified , intellectual capacities of memory , intellect , and will . Thomas Aquinas , in the 13th century , locates the image of God in man&amp;#39 ; s reason , by which we have the capacity to know and love God . There have been these various proposals that something structural accounts for our being the image of God . It makes us different from the animals . It makes us more like God because of that structural feature or features . <p> === 2 . Relational Understanding . === <p> The relational view is one that developed more recently . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology , were Karl Barth and Emil Brunner . The relational view argues that the text itself , in Genesis 1:26-27 , indicates that it is male and female who is the image of God . Verse 27 female he created them . &amp;quot ; That language is very important , indicating , for these theologians , that it is the male/female relationship , or in more general terms , it is relationality that constitutes the image of God . <p> === 3 . Functional Understanding . === <p> This again is a more recent understanding . I think it is clear to say that the structural understanding , or some form of it , has been the most consistent one through church history . Yet today , the functional one is receiving a great deal of attention and appreciation . In fact , my own view , that I will mention in a moment , tends to give favor to the functional understanding . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God&amp;#39 ; has to do primarily , not with our structure or relationship , but as our structure and our relationship are put to work , as it were , that is , as we are called to do what God has commanded us to do . Advocates of this view , Leonard Verduin and D. J. A. Clines , have argued that the double-reference in Genesis 1:26 , 28 of man ruling over the fish of the sea ( notice that is mentioned twice in this image of God passage in Genesis 1 ) , the birds of the air and so on can not be accidental . What God intends by this is for His image-of-God-people to represent Him in ruling the earth that He has made . In other words , they become , as it were , vice-regents for God . Yes , He is King , but notice that in Genesis 2 God takes Adam , who is image of God , and tells Adam , &amp;quot ; You cultivate the garden Adam . Now it is my garden , I made it , &amp;quot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of it . You become caretaker of My creation . &amp;quot ; Notice the animals . How significant this is that He says , &amp;quot ; Adam , you name them . &amp;quot ; Granted , they are God&amp;#39 ; s animals ; God has the right to name them . To name something is to indicate your authority over , your ownership of , even . So God , in giving the right of naming the animals to Adam , is indicating , &amp;quot ; You have rulership over these creatures that I have made . Yes , I made them but you act as vice-regent and rule over the animals . &amp;quot ; <p> == B. The Image of God , the Fall , and its Renewal == <p> === 1 . Ancient Near Eastern Background . === <p> One very helpful thing , I think , in trying to make sense of the image of God , what happens to it in the Fall and what happens to it in our restoration in Christ , is the ancient near eastern background that D. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of years ago , asked this very simple question . &amp;quot ; Why is it that the writer of Genesis , Moses , did not define for us what &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; is ? Obviously , it is important ; everybody agrees with that . But why didn&amp;#39 ; t he tell us what he meant by it . &amp;quot ; Clines suspected that the reason he didn&amp;#39 ; t is because it was already understood ; it was a commonly understood term or phrase . He went to work and looked in the ancient near eastern background to this and discovered that , sure enough , &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; is there and used prominently in the ancient near eastern context . &amp;#39 ; Image&amp;#39 ; can refer to inanimate objects , but , when it refers to a human being , it is of a king who has rulership responsibilities that he carries out on behalf of one of the gods . It looks as though this does give preference to the functional notion of &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Relational , and Functional . === <p> My own understanding of image of God really attempts then to bring together the structural , relational , and functional aspects of this . Let me read my own definition of image of God . It is contained in an article , if any of you wishes to get it , &amp;quot ; Male and Female Complementarity in the Image of God&amp;quot ; in the &lt;u&gt;Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood&lt;/u&gt; , 7/1 Spring 2002 issue . The definition reads as follows : &amp;quot ; The &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; in man , as functional wholism , means that God made human beings , both male and female , to be created and finite representations ( images of God ) of God&amp;#39 ; s own nature , that in relationship with him and each other , they might be his representatives ( imaging God ) in carrying out the responsibilities he has given to them . In this sense , we are images of God ( the structural side of things ) in order to image God ( the functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordering of our lives and carrying out of our God-given responsibilities . &amp;quot ; I think this notion of functional wholism conveys the notion that we are made a certain way to do a certain thing . Yes , the structure is important ; the relationship is important ; but all of that is there to serve the purpose of the function that God has given to us . Another book you might want to look at on this that is very helpful is Anthony Hoekema&amp;#39 ; s , &lt;u&gt;Created in God&amp;#39 ; s Image&lt;/u&gt; . He has a very helpful discussion and basically argues along the same lines as I am presenting here . <p> === 3 . Effects of the Fall and our Restoration into the Image of Christ . === <p> It is so interesting ; if &amp;#39 ; image of God&amp;#39 ; is fundamentally functioning in a way that carries out God&amp;#39 ; s purposes , you can see where the Fall just really distorted that . Even though we still retain reason , will , a spiritual nature and the rest , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting as God&amp;#39 ; s vice-regents ; rather , we are in rebellion against Him and guilty of treason against the King . So what has to happen , in Christ , is that we have to be restored to a place where we once again live the way Christ lived . How did Christ live ? Over it again we read , &amp;quot ; I came to do the will of the Father who sent me . I don&amp;#39 ; t speak on my own initiative ; I speak as the Father taught me. &amp;quot ; We need to be &amp;#39 ; images of God&amp;#39 ; the way Christ was the &amp;#39 ; Image of God &amp;#39 ; par excellence , who lived his life to carry out the will of the Father . The restoration of us involves the restoration of our substance , surely our structure , as our minds and wills are reshaped to be Christ-like , but then , that has the function or the outcome of enabling us to do what we were called to do . In that sense , we become like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God&amp;#39 ; as we are remade the &amp;#39 ; image of Christ&amp;#39 ; . <p> == DOCTRINE OF SIN == <p> == I. Nature of Sin . == <p> == A. The Essence of Sin == <p> === 1 . Urge for Independence from God . === <p> It seem to me that sin , at its very essence , in Genesis 3 , is an urge for independence from God . It seems as though this urge for independence is evident when the woman in the garden is urged by the serpent , who is there , to look at the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil differently than she had ever seen it before . The serpent tells her , in verses 4 and 5 , &amp;quot ; Surely you will not die , &amp;quot ; denying , of course , what God had told to Adam , &amp;quot ; For God knows that in the day that you eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . &amp;quot ; Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about God as the source of her good , the one who wishes her best , who wants to provide and care for her . The tempter is causing the woman to think of God as a withholder , stingy , resentful , not wishing for her to experience all that can be experienced in life . She looked at the tree , in verse 6 , and she saw that it was &amp;quot ; good for food&amp;quot ; , it was &amp;quot ; a delight to the eyes&amp;quot ; and &amp;quot ; desirable to make one wise , so she took from its fruit and ate ; and gave to her husband who was with her , and he ate . &amp;quot ; <p> === 2 . Three Kinds of Urges for Independence ( Gen. 3:6 ) === <p> ====a . The Hedonist Urge. ==== <p> She saw that the tree was &amp;quot ; good for food . &amp;quot ; In other words , she said , &amp;quot ; I will have my appetite satisfied my way , I don&amp;#39 ; t care that God has said that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like the looks of it , I&amp;#39 ; ll eat it . &amp;quot ; This is the hedonist urge . <p> ====b . The Covetous Urge. ==== <p> She saw that the tree was a &amp;quot ; delight to the eyes . &amp;quot ; Obviously there was no prohibition against looking at the tree , so this must mean that she wanted to take it . A delight to the eyes meant she liked what she saw and she wanted it to be hers , even though God had said she could not have it . Nonetheless , she coveted what God said she could not have and she took it . <p> ====c . The Prideful Urge. ==== <p> Then she saw that the tree was &amp;quot ; desirable to make one wise . &amp;quot ; Here she wanted to have her own wisdom ; she did not want to be dependent upon God . The prideful urge brought her to this place of rebellion . <p> Three kinds of urges for independence , the hedonist urge , the covetous urge , the prideful urge , all move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to us our destruction . This is so instructive , because obviously , the path to wholeness and righteousness and happiness is just the opposite of these . The hedonist urge is the opposite of finding our satisfaction in God ; covetous urge , the opposite of being content with what God gives us ; the prideful urge the opposite of giving glory to God rather than wanting glory to come to ourselves . <p> == B. Total Depravity. == <p> It is a very important doctrine that both Arminian and Calvinist traditions have affirmed in the history of the church . It really grows out of a view that was proposed by Augustine way back in the early church , was lost for a fair part of the middle ages , through much of Roman Catholicism , but revived in the Reformation period . <p> === 1 . Definition . === <p> The doctrine of total depravity affirms , first of all , the definition that every part of us is affected by sin . Every part of us , our mind , our emotions , our will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sin . Sin&amp;#39 ; s effect is pervasive is another way to think of it . You should understand &amp;quot ; total&amp;quot ; here in an extensive sense , indicating every part is affected , not an intensive sense , that is , it does not mean we are as bad as we could be . And we should give God praise for this . Our minds , for example , though corrupted , are not as corrupted as they could be . They still can think true thoughts , even though they can&amp;#39 ; t think truly enough . Our wills are corrupted , but they are not as bad as they could be ; it is not that every single action we perform is of the same kind of evil . Jesus said , &amp;quot ; If you , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children . &amp;quot ; So even evil people , unregenerate people , can do good things . Total depravity refers to the extent of sin that affects all of us . <p> === 2 . Support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at is Romans 1:21ff . You can see there the progression of sin and the affect on mind , emotion , will and body . All aspects of us , including turning from our natural sexual drives to unnatural ones , are results of sin in us . Consider also Romans 8:5-8 , Ephesians 4:17-18 , and Galatians 5:16-17 , 24 . <p> == C. Total Inability . == <p> This is a doctrine that flows out of total depravity . <p> === 1 . Definition . === <p> Because every part of us is affected by sin , we are totally unable to live lives , make choices or carry out actions that are pleasing to God . <p> === 2 . Support . === <p> Consider , for example , John 15:5 where Jesus says , &amp;quot ; Apart from me you can do nothing . &amp;quot ; This &amp;quot ; nothing&amp;quot ; certainly does not mean that you&amp;#39 ; re frozen ; you can not act ; you can not do anything . What does he mean ? He means you can not do anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eternal value . You are unable to do anything that God would look at and say , &amp;quot ; That is good , that is honorable , that is glorifying to me. &amp;quot ; Or , consider Hebrews 11:6 where we read , &amp;quot ; Without faith it is impossible to please God . &amp;quot ; So that means that all people who are not Christians , all people who are not believers , who do not have faith in God through Christ Jesus , are not able to please God . That does not mean that everything they do is equally evil ; but it does mean nothing that they do is pleasing to God . Nothing that they do gives glory to God . Nothing that they do would God say is good , even though they are not doing necessarily overtly evil actions at every point . <p> There is another passage that I think is very important to bear in mind here , especially as it relates to the question of whether unbelievers , apart from grace , can believe in Christ or come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:5 , &amp;quot ; Those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh and those who are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit . &amp;quot ; He has in mind here two categories of people ; those who are &amp;quot ; according to the flesh&amp;quot ; are unbelievers and those who are &amp;quot ; according to the Spirit&amp;quot ; are believers , the Spirit has come within them . What does he say about these two ? Verse 6 , &amp;quot ; The mind set on the flesh is death , but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace . Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God for it does not subject itself to the law of God and it is not even able to do so , and those who are in the flesh can not please God . &amp;quot ; It is very clear that in the flesh , of our own , apart from God&amp;#39 ; s work of grace within us , we can not do anything to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about this in another lecture later . In the Arminian tradition , Jacob Arminius was insistent that grace is needed to overcome the affects of total depravity and total inability so that we could believe in Christ . All of us are saved by grace and apart from ourselves we would never come . <p> == D. Acts of Personal Sin . == <p> Let me just mention to you here these four categories and give you a few passages for each one . <p> === 1 . Commission and Omission . === <p> Acts of personal sin can come in the form of sin as commission , that is , sins that we carry out and do , commit , and sins of omission , that is , sins when we fail to do what we ought to do . Sins of commission are easy enough to understand . Think of the Ten Commandments , Exodus 20:13-17. &amp;quot ; You shall not murder , steal , commit adultery , covet , &amp;quot ; so on . These are clearly actions that we ought not do , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sinful . For example , in James 4:17 James says , &amp;quot ; The one who knows what is right to do and does not do it , to him it is sin . &amp;quot ; Or consider Matthew 25:41-46 where Jesus says , &amp;quot ; Because you did not give me a cup of water , you did not visit me in jail , because of the things that you did not do , you will be guilty then of judgment . <p> === 2 . Outward Actions and Inward Attitudes . === <p> Obviously some sins are outward in nature , either sins that you commit or things you fail to do that are outward . Murder , stealing , or failing to help when you should , those are all outward sins . There are also sins of attitude that are in some ways more fundamental ; they give rise to outward actions of sin . I think this was what Jesus was getting at in Matthew 5 where he spoke , for example , of one who has not murdered yet . But he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are angry toward your brother , you are guilty of murder ; or if you lust after women you are guilty of adultery . That does not mean to say that the attitude is the same as the action , but it is to say that the attitude is itself sinful , is a sinful action as well . Look at some point at Deuteronomy 28:47-48 and you will see in the Old Testament that this distinction was made as well . They were to obey the law , but they were to do so with a glad heart as well . Outward action and inward attitude both mattered . <p> === 3 . Conscious Rebellion and Ignorance . === <p> Some sins are voluntary , consciously done and others are done out of ignorance ; the person does not know that he has sinned , but he has sinned nonetheless . Look , for example , at Numbers 15:27-31 , Particularly for the sins of ignorance , consider 1 Timothy 1:12-14 . <p> === 4 . Greater and Lesser Sins . === <p> It does seem as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider these passages : Matthew 12:31-32 , Matthew 23:23 , and 1 Corinthians 6:17-18 . <p> == E. Systemic or Social Manifestations of Sin . == <p> It is clear that sin is not only an attitude and action of individual human beings , but also sin can be manifest in social structures . These come in two different forms . <p> === 1 . Good Structures used for Evil . === <p> One is when social structures are created for good purpose , but then used for evil . Look , for example , at Amos 5:10-15 , where the gate of the city , which is the place where justice is meant to be meted out , is used to benefit the oppressor and hurt the poor . Here you have a good structure , a judicial system , that is used for evil . <p> === 2 . Formation of Evil Structures to do Evil . === <p> The Scripture also condemns , even more severely , the formation of evil structures , which are designed from the outset to do evil . Consider , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king enacts statutes that are intended from the very outset to do evil . I think of the Roe v. Wade decision of our Supreme Court as an example of a declaration as law of something that is by its very nature evil , that is , permitting the killing of innocent human life through abortion . <p> == II . Original Sin == <p> == A. Definition . == <p> The term &amp;#39 ; original sin&amp;#39 ; might convey the notion that this is the doctrine about where sin originates , say , in the Garden of Eden or , perhaps before that , with Lucifer who fell from heaven . Actually , the doctrine is not about that . Rather , it is about how the stain of sinfulness is passed on to , or originates in , each individual person . That is , how do you and I become sinful ? How is sin passed on to us ? <p> == B. Theories of Original Sin == <p> === 1 . The Federal or Representative Theory . === <p> This is held by many , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view , Adam was the representative or the federal head of the human race , and when he sinned he brought sin upon all of the human race . How was that ? Simply , because as the federal head or the representative , the judgment that was given to him was a judgment that legally was required to be given to us as well . The judgment of death to Adam was a judgment on Adam and all whom he represented . One of the compelling reasons for this view , for those in the Reformed tradition , is they see this theory of federal headship to apply not only to Adam , but also to Christ . Just as in Christ His righteousness comes to us , and we had nothing to do with the righteous act of Christ in His obedient life and His obedient death on the cross , yet we benefit from it as His righteousness is imputed to us , that is , we are credited with the righteousness of Christ though we had nothing to do with it . Federal theologians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that we had nothing to do with the sinfulness of Adam , and yet his sinfulness is imputed to us or charged against our account . They understand these two aspects of federal headship , of Adam and Christ respectively then , to be parallel . <p> === 2 . The Realist or Augustinian Theory . === <p> Augustine was the one who first proposed the notion that the sin of Adam and Eve , his wife , is passed down to us through this long chain , as it were , of reproduction . Most people who hold this view also hold the traducian view of the origin of the soul , and hold that parents reproduce whole persons . They also pass on their sin to those whole persons . We actually become sinners because we were in Adam as he sinned . There is an analogy that is sometimes used for this . If you think of an oak tree , at one time that mighty oak tree was all contained in this little seed called an acorn . In that acorn , whatever the oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there was a disease in the oak tree that shows up later on , that gave deformed branches or something like that , that same disease would be somehow apparent in the genetic structure of the acorn itself . So , likewise , when Adam sinned , in a sense there was a malstructure that took place , that is , a sinfulness that took place in Adam , so when he reproduced , he reproduced of his kind . Therefore , we stand in Adam as those who come out of him and share in his sinfulness . It is sometimes called the realist view , because there is a sense in which we were really in Adam when he sinned , according to this view . Augustine took this from Romans 5:12 ; this is the key text on this doctrine , we read , &amp;quot ; Therefore , just as through one man , &amp;quot ; Adam , &amp;quot ; sin entered the world , and death through sin , and so death spread to all men , because all sinned. &amp;quot ; Augustine understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we become volitional creatures and make our own choices , but rather we sin because we were in Adam seminally , really there but in seminal form , we were in Adam when he sinned . <p> One thing in conclusion here is that , whichever view you hold on this , the federal view or the realist view , both amount to the same answer to this question . Are we born into this world sinners or do we become sinners when we sin ? Both views would answer the question , we are born into this world sinners . We actually carry out that sinfulness volitionally when we are able to think and make our own decisions and the like . But , nonetheless , we are born into this world in sin , whether it is because the sin of Adam is imputed to us in the federal view , or whether we inherit a sinful nature from Adam in the realist view . We are conceived and born in sin and come into this world with sinful natures . We are totally depraved , totally unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will express that nature in rebellious actions . I have children myself and can remember points when I first saw the sin nature of my children expressed in a very , very young age , with their sense of autonomy and rebellion and wanting their own will .

For Sankara , there is only subject , but for Ramanuja there is subject and object .

@@35723265 @4723265/ <h> Human Nature and the Soul <h> A. Theories on the Structure of Human Nature <p> There are two issues that are involved in the question of humanity 's constitution . One is , how are we made up ? It is sort of a question of a parts list . What makes up a human being ? Are we one thing ? Are we two things ? Are we three things or more ? That is what this section is about , the Structure of human nature , what makes up a human being . If you answer this question that we are made up of something physical and spiritual , then the next question is , how do we get the spiritual part ? Where does that come from ? So the transmission of the soul will be the next thing that we look at . <p> In terms of the structure of human nature , that is , what makes us up as human beings , there are really three main positions that are held . <h> 1 . Monism <h> a . The View <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Bible talks about human beings it does so referring to parts of us , but those parts are never to be understood , according to this view , as separable from us . It talks about our minds or our heart or our soul or our body or whatever , but none of those instances of referring to parts is meant to indicate that these are separate substances . They are really just aspects of one unified substance ; hence the term Monism . We are one thing , not two or three or more substances brought together . We are one substance . <p> One of the main proponents of this view is H. Wheeler Robinson . Another more recent advocate is Robert Brinsmead . Probably the most famous person that you have heard of is G. C. Berkouwer , who argued for Monism in his book ' ' Man , the Image of God ' ' . <h> b . Support <p> The Bible describes us as whole human beings that are affected by physical influences as well a emotional , spiritual , and intellectual ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us physically . Does n't that indicate that there is this integration and oneness of who we are ? If you are depressed , you might not eat the way you should . Intellectual things can affect your spiritual reality . How many people have had doubts about things intellectually , and their spiritual life is hampered by that ? There is this integration indicating that we are all connected together ; a body-soul unity . We are all connected together and we ought not see parts of us as separable ontological units , according to this view ; they are not separable from one another but rather always functioning together . So we are not human unless everything is together . <h> c . Response <p> I think that it is absolutely right that there is this integration that takes place in who we are . Clearly God made us in such a way that our minds , emotions , bodies and wills are interconnected . That seems to be experientially so very true of us . But does that observation entail that we are all one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing be true with a different ontology ; namely , we are made up different substances which together work in an integrated away ? In other words , I do n't think that you have to hold to Monism to account for integration . Monism is not necessary to account for a unified sense of our interconnectedness as human beings . So the question is , is there biblical evidence that Monists may not appeal to ; biblical evidence for understanding who we are as inseparable substances ? At this point my response is , let 's look further . It makes sense , but are there biblical reasons for thinking that there are in fact separable substances that make up the human nature ? If so , then you have to return to this question , how does the integration take place ? <h> 2 . Dichotomy <h> a . The View <p> This view holds that we are made up two substances . We are a dichotomous reality ; two substances brought together which are physical and nonphysical , material and not material substances , normally referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the word soul , that is the most common term used in terms of the nonmaterial aspect of us . We are physical beings , and we are immaterial , spiritual beings . Those two things come together to form who we are as human beings . But nonetheless , they are separable realities . In saying that , the Dichotomist is not saying that they are best separated , or they ought to be separated , or that we are fully functioning human beings as God created us to be when they are separated . The Dichotomist is claiming that they are in principle separable ; you can divide up these two realities of material and spiritual or body and soul . The first person to argue a Dichotomist view in church history was Tertellian . Tertellian gave a defense of this view in his ' ' A Treatise on the Soul ' ' , in which he argued for the separation of the soul from the body . It has been a dominant view through the history of the church ; there is probably more representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More have held to a Dichotomist view . <h> b . Support <p> In terms of differing with Monism in particular , the Dichotomist would want to point to passages which seem to indicate a clear separation of soul from body at the point of physical death . If true , this presents the Monist view with tremendous problems . How can this be ? Are we really human ? Maybe not in the full sense , but do we not continue to exist after death , and yet our bodies are in the grave ? Look at Luke 23:43 , Jesus ' statement to the thief on the cross . <p> Lk 23:43 And he said to him , " Truly I say to you , today you shall be with me in Paradise . " <p> Later that day the body of the thief on the cross was in the grave . What about Jesus saying today you shall be with me ? We know Jesus ' body was in a grave until resurrection morning . So how can this be unless the " you " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist after they have separated from their bodies . It seems to indicate that that is the case . <p> Matt 10:28 " Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul ; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell . <p> 2 Cor 5:8 we are of good courage , I say , and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord . <p> This is a great comfort to those who lose loved ones who are believers to think they are absent from the body just like that , but grandpa , or mom is with the Lord . That is a wonderful comfort . <p> In Philippians 1:21-24 Paul expresses his desire to be Christ but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for the sake of others . <p> Phil 1:21 For to me , to live is Christ and to die is gain . Phil 1:22 But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean fruitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose . Phil 1:23 But I am hard-pressed from both directions , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , for that is very much better ; Phil 1:24 yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake . <p> To depart and be with Christ means to die physically . To remain in the flesh is not to be with Christ . So Paul anticipates that at the instant he dies , he is separated from his body and goes to be with the Lord . <p> The second argument is more of an argument in response to the Trichotomist view that says there are three parts of who we are : body , soul , and spirit . The Dichotomist wants to give some arguments here that indicate that soul and spirit are used interchangeably quite often in Scripture . <p> Jn 12:27 Now my soul has become troubled ; and what shall I say , " Father , save me from this hour " ? But for this purpose I came to this hour . <p> Jn 13:21 When Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and testified and said , " Truly , truly , I say to you , that one of you will betray me . " <p> In the first one Jesus says , " Now my soul has become troubled " and in the second one it says of him , " He became troubled in spirit . " What are we to make of that ? The Dichotomist will argue there really is n't a distinction that you can maintain between ' ' pneuma ' ' ( spirit ) and ' ' psuche ' ' ( soul ) . They are used in functionally the same way . <p> Is 26:9 At night my soul longs for you , indeed , my spirit within me seeks you diligently ; for when the earth experiences your judgments the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness . <p> These are synonymous parallelism type indicators that it is hard to distinguish soul and spirit in either Old Testament or New Testament references . <p> The third and last argument that Dichotomists would give is that there are occasions when Scripture refers to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become significant when we think about the Trichotomist view . The word for spirit is ' ' pneuma in Greek and ' ' ruach ' ' in Hebrew . <p> became a living being . <p> There is no mention here of spirit . He is fully human when he has a body from the dust of the ground formed and breathed in soul . That does it ; there is not a third component that is needed , namely , a spirit . <p> Matt 10:28 " Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul ; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell . <p> To kill the body is not necessarily to kill the soul , and yet body and soul together are used as a summary phrase for all of who we all your mind . " <p> This is an interesting passage because in all of the Synoptics you do n't find spirit in any of the renderings of them . Love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind and strength ( if you have all four present ) . Where is spirit ? I take it that Jesus , or the person who says this to Jesus , mean love the Lord you God with all of who you are , every aspect of your nature . Love the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , mind , and strength . The notable absence there in light of the Trichotomist view , is no mention of spirit . <h> c . Response <p> My own thought is that I find this a very compelling view . I think that are problems with the Trichotomist view . The Monist view , in my judgment , altogether fails at the question of the death of a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper , a philosopher at Calvin Seminary , wrote a book a few years back called ' ' Body , Soul , and Life Everlasting ' ' and he makes this point . You ca n't have a Monist view if you take seriously that at death we are absent from the body but present with the Lord . How can this work with a Monist view ? The only thing that you could say is that there is some kind of spiritual resurrection that takes place ; and some have held this , that absent from the body present with Lord means that you are spiritually raised at that point . The problem with that is that it conflicts with the doctrine of the resurrection of the body which takes place at the coming of Christ . So that is not going to work . I think that the Dichotomist view clearly is on track in arguing for at least these two . Then the question becomes , should we add a third one : spirit ? My own view is probably not . <h> 3 . Trichotomy <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three parts : body , soul and spirit . The prevailing view of this notion through the history of the church has been that all human beings are made with body , soul and spirit together , but spirit is not oriented toward God until regeneration takes place . This view makes a whole more sense when you look at the spiritualism that is present in so much of the world that is n't Christian . I am from the Pacific Northwest . The Pacific Northwest , Washington and Oregon states , are so different from the Northeast , New England area because the Northeast is kind of dead spiritually . It is kind of like Europe , there is hardly any spiritual interest up there at all . In the Northwest there is vibrant spirituality : occult , paganism , neopaganism , new age , you name it . Go to the book stores in Portland , Oregon and the New Age section is packed with books ; there is a lot of interest . This view would hold that there is this spiritual capacity in every person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another view that has been advocated more recently that there is no spirit until you become a Christian . So you have a body and a soul , and the spirit is added at that particular point . For most of church history those that advocated a Trichotomist view held that all three are present . <p> What is the difference between the three ? The body is our physical aspect . The soul is the aspects of human nature that we have in common with the animal kingdom . So even things like reasoning are not distinctive to humanity . We know this even better now than would have been the case hundreds of years ago . With emotions , at least dogs have emotions ; I do n't know if cats do or not . I have never been convinced of it . Dogs certainly do . Just look at Fido when you come home . Certainly there are appetites , longings , drives , aspirations ; all of that is part of the soul according to this view . It is emotions , feelings , thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . What is spirit ? Spirit , according to this view , is the center of our connection with spiritual reality . You will never come home at the end of the day and find your dog or your cat or your chimpanzee or your dolphin worshipping . It is not going to happen . They wo n't be kneelling in front of an altar , praying ; but you might find your son or daughter doing that ; you find people doing that . So it is this connectedness with , awareness of , and reaching out toward a spiritual reality , a transcendence reality that marks the spirit according to this view . <h> b . Support <p> The fist observation that a Trichotomist would want to make is that it is interesting that both Old and New Testaments have their respective words for soul and spirit . In the Old Testament the word ' ' nephesh ' ' is used in and in the New Testament the word ' ' psuche ' ' is ued for soul . For spirit , in the Old Testament ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament pneuma . So you have in both Testaments distinctive terminology , and it raises the question , is terminology indicative of ontology ? Is it referring to separate things ? If you analyze that , it is not a very strong argument . Because how many terms are there for different parts ? There are ears , noses and eyes , how many words are we going to make up because we have parts for them . It does n't get us anywhere . <p> The second argument does certainly favor their position understood as they do . There are a couple of passages in particular and two main ones they argue are like full fledge proof for a Trichotomist view . <p> In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul is indicating that he is longing for God to do this sanctifying work in these people . <p> 1 Thess 5:23 Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely , and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . <p> They say here is clear text indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and body preserved complete . May he sanctify you entirely . This comes the closest , they argue , to anything like a parts list of a human being , an indicator of our ontology , what we are , those three things . <p> The second passage , not quite as forceful , though nonetheless important , is Hebrews soul and of spirit , <p> Can they be divided ? Yes , there it : the division of soul and spirit , indicating that these are separate things . <p> The also refer to 1 Corinthians 2:14,15 and 1 Corinthians 15:44 where Paul uses ' ' psychikos ' ' and ' ' pneumatos ' ' indicating the " soulish " person and the spirit person . They say that indicates that soul and spirit are distinct @ are spiritually discerned . 1 Cor 2:15 The spiritual person judges all things , but is himself to be judged by no one also a spiritual body . <h> c . Response <p> 1 Thessalonians 5:23 , on the surface , ' ' prima facia ' ' as they say it in Latin , this does look like a very strong case for the Trichotomist view . I can see why people are persuaded by it . However , in my judgment , the main thing that leads me to question this is that I do n't think this passage is different in kind than the " Love your Lord your God " passage ( Matt 22:37 or any of the Synoptic accounts of that ) . Love the Lord your God with all of who you are ; clearly that is the implication . Can you imagine if , in fact , spirit is what the Trichotomist says it is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God with all your heart , soul , mind and strength , " and leave out spirit . What an omission . The very part of you that is most essential in connecting with God is left out . It is seems to me it is more likely to say neither of these passages is meant to give an ontology . Neither one is to give a parts list of who we are as human beings . It is picking out major aspects to indicate the whole ; parts for the whole . It could have been two items . Even with the " Love the Lord your God " statement , the Synoptic accounts are not identical . So you have difference among them . Well my guess is that for one writer it does n't matter about this part , right ? No , it is part for whole that is the point of it . You could have picked out more parts ; you could have picked out fewer parts , but the point is the parts represent the whole . My suspicion is that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not giving an exact parts list , but he is indicating parts for whole . It could have been two ; it could have been four , whatever . But the fact that he mentions body , spirit and soul is not in itself decisive . <p> What about Hebrews 4:12 ? This is an easier one in my judgment to show the problem with the Trichotomist argument because if you read the whole verse you realize that there is a problem intentions of the heart . <p> Would you want to say joints and marrow are separable substances ? Or is n't the point actually the opposite of what the Trichotomist is saying ? The Trichotomist is say that indicates the division of two separable things . Is n't the point rather that the word of God is so powerful that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow , and bring a division into what is one ? Is n't that the point ? That would ague then for the division of soul and spirit not being ontologically separate , but that the Word of God can enter into what is one thing and divide it or can open it in a way to expose what is there ? That seems to fit better with what he is saying . <p> So it looks to me that neither one of the passages that would be the strongest case for a Trichotomist view in fact argue for it , although people are free to differ on that . My own judgment is that I do n't find either of those passages clearly compelling . <p> One more comment . Suppose you end up with a Dichotomist view ; what about the Monist question of the wholeism of our experience ? I think it is just as true to say that the way God made us is that he made our spirit and body , which are separable , but he means for them to work together . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that they have inherit integration by design . So I do n't think you have to hold a Monist view to account for all of that integration that takes place . <p> A comment in regard to this view . The Trichotomist view has implications for spirituality that are troubling . It is troubling because if spirit is really what relates us most directly to the Lord , and spirit is not soul , what is soul ? Mind , emotions , will affections , longings , drives , aspirations is all here , but what is it ? Number one , it is very ethereal . This view promotes a mystical view of spirituality , a kind of connectedness with God that is really not connected with the way we think or the way we feel . It fits very well with the view in ' ' The Cloud of Unknowing ' ' ( if you are familiar with that document from church history in the late medieval period ) , in which entering into a relationship with God is the finite entering the infinite , the bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in . We enter into unknown . That fits this really well . You try not to think , you try not to feel , and it ends up being this sort of odd spirituality that actually fits the culture we live in . It is much more like Buddhist , Zen meditation than Christian meditation . But what if spirit and soul are in fact the same thing ? We are bodily and spiritual beings , then we realize spiritual growth has everything to do with how we think , how we feel , what we choose , what we value . Those things become central to spiritual growth , not something that is sort of peripheral to the whole question . So spiritual growth becomes a matter of how do we retrain our minds , as it talks about in Romans 12:1,2 . How do we develop affections so that we love the Lord our God with our hearts , soul , mind and strength ? How do we develop wills that will choose to follow the will of God as Christ did ? It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what spirituality is . Meditation is not escaping rational thought about God . Biblical meditation is zeroing in on rational thoughts of God as he has revealed himself in his word ; it is thinking hard about who God is and his attributes and Scriptural truths that reshape the way we think . I do think that this has some implication in terms of how we understand what life is as a Christian and how to grow in Christ . <h> B. Transmission of the Soul <p> There are two main views . If you hold either a Dichotomist or Trichotomist view , either one of them , then you have the question of , how it we become beings that are " ensouled " ? Where we have the immaterial part , how does that happen ? <h> 1 . Creationism <h> a . The View <p> This is the view widely held in Roman Catholic and Reformed circles , in particular , that God creates a human soul and joins it to the human body at some time between conception and physical birth . Our former President Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pro-choice position on abortion . I taught with a theology professor at Bethel Seminary , Clarence Bass who holds this view . He caused Bethel all kinds of problems because he was pro-choice . His argument was until a baby is born , it is not a person . They take Genesis 2:7 as the indicator of full life ; God breathed into Adam and he became a living soul . So when a baby takes its first breath on its own , that is when " ensoulment " takes place , according to some who hold this view . So until birth , even partial birth , if the baby has n't breathed yet , then it is n't a human being ; it is n't a person according to some who hold this view . There are advocates of this view , of creationism , who say , we do n't know when " ensoulment " takes place , so we dare not abort the fetus because it may be a human person ; we may be killing a human person . This is the Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sort of an argument of avoiding the greater evil of killing what could , in fact , be a human person . <p> Let me chart this out for you . God creates Adam and Eve and through biological reproduction bodies are formed , through sexual reproduction . The woman conceives and a fetus , a human body is formed , but God provides the soul in each case to that particular individual . People who hold this view , the Creationist view of the soul , tend to hold also a federal view on how we become sinners . The sin of Adam is charged against us , and so God creates a good soul and then imputes the sin of Adam to that soul . So we are ensouled with the sinful soul of Adam . The Creationist view of the transmission of the soul is usually linked with , especially in reformed theology , the federal headship view of original sin , of how we become sinners . <h> b . Support <p> Genesis 2:7 is seen as a paradigm . That God created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done with the body . Then he breaths into it the breath of life . So Adam is the paradigm . <p> They argue that it accords best with Christ 's humanity . This way Christ can be born of Mary and have a fully human body , but the soul be given to him by God who is sinless . For every other person who is in Adam , the sin of Adam is imputed to that person , every one of us , every single human being , except one : Christ because he is the second Adam . He is not in the line of Adam , for he receives a good pure soul . It is not imputed with sin . So the body comes through the line of Adam and Eve and the soul is created by God . They argue that that helps . <p> The other argument is that it fits best with the federal headship view . If you are inclined toward a federal headship view of sin , then you will likely be inclined toward this Creationist view as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Response <p> I will save the response until I do the other one . There is a lot to commend it , but you have to look at more evidence . <h> 2 . Traducianism <h> a . The View <p> Where does this term Traducian come from ? Traducianism comes from the Latin word ' ' traduco ' ' which means to carry over or bring across or transfer . It has been held mostly in Lutheran and Baptist traditions although some Reformed theologians hold it . For example W. G. T. Shedd 's Systematic Theology argues for this view . According to this view , God creates Adam and then Eve and gives to them the responsibility to procreate who they are as they are as human beings ; namely body and soul are passed on , ' ' traduco ' ' , transferred over through the human reproductive system . So when parents conceive a child , they conceive a human being not just a human body . There is procreation that takes place in this view . There is a sense in which in the Creationism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body are , in both cases , from God . But in the Creationist view the soul is created by God directly or immediately without any mediation whereas in this view the soul is created by God immediately through the mediation of the parents bringing about a body-soul person . <h> b . Support <p> You could look at Genesis 1:26-28 . You could also look at Genesis 5:3 where the human pair is told to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth . The implication is just like cows and horses and fishes . What do they reproduce ? Cows and horses and fish . And humans reproduce humans ; they really do procreate . They are involved in the task that God had given them of filling the earth with humans . Genesis 5:3 I think is really significant on this point ; it is a very strong text indicating this view . <p> Gen 5:3 When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he became the father of a son in his own likeness , according to his image , and named him Seth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeness of Adam . Is he image of God ? Yes , go to chapter 9 ; you ca n't kill because you are killing someone who is made in the image of God . How did Seth get in the image of God ? By being made in the image of Adam who is in the image of God . How are you in the image of God ? By being in the image of your parents who are in the image of their parents , who are in the image of their parents , who are ultimately in the image of Adam . So there is this procreation that takes place . Seth is in the image and likeness of his father . <p> The second argument is that the Bible speaks in some cases of descendants as being in the loins of their ancestors . For example , Genesis 46:26 and Hebrew 7:9,10 . <p> Gen 46:26 All the persons belonging to Jacob , who came to Egypt , his direct descendants , not including the wives of Jacob 's sons , were sixty-six persons in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Abraham even Levi , who received tithes , paid tithes , for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him . <p> That seems to indicate that there is a tie between Levi and Abraham that indicates that he really does come from Abraham . It seems to indicate this line of transferring humanity on through . <p> What about the argument about Christ in the other position ? Can this view account for Christ 's sinlessness ? Yes it can , simply by arguing in one of two ways . When we come to Christ one argument is that the sin that had been imputed and passed on to all of the subsequent generations just simply by miraculous interception is not allowed to in relation to Christ . Another argument , the one I favor invokes the notion of male headship . Notice , it is the sins of the fathers visited upon the third and fourth generation . Notice , when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden , Eve sinned first and Adam is held accountable for it . And notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my judgment , at least two things . One , he was fully God and fully man . So the Holy Spirit took the place of a human father and brought about this conception so that the one born would be called the Son of God ( Lk 1:35 ) . The second thing was , it prevented the sinful line of Adam from being passed on from the father . Every other human being born , you and me included , had a dad ; at least at the point of conception there was a human father involved and sin is passed on . Not with Christ ; there was no human father . <p> The other point I will make is not a biblical argument ; it is simply experiential or psychological . If you look at these two views and ask the question , which view argues better for what we think of a family resemblance that there is among children and parents ; which is more than physical ? Yes a daughter can have her daddy 's eyes , but a son can have his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually created by God it breaks the link , it seems , of what passes on immaterially from parents to children . This is even shown when adoptions take place ; the children are taken from their natural parents immediately and studies have shown how many similarities there are to the natural parents . Twins are separated and they find that there are these vast similarities . <p> In my view , this view also accounts better for the kind of commonality in family lines that is more than physical . It is spiritual , emotional , dispositional , personality and all kinds of things , it seems to be passed on . <p> One another thing about this view , if it is true , really does raise your conception of conception . It raises the estimate of what it is when a mother and father procreate , making in the image of God . It is one of the reasons why it should not be treated lightly ; there should not be sexual relations among people who are not married or outside of marriage in adultery ?

@@35723277 @4723277/ <h> Distinctive Theologies in the Gospel of Luke <h> I. Introduction <p> In our first three lectures we looked at the dominant and distinctive theology found by considering the synoptics ( Matthew , Mark and Luke ) together , because of the fact that they are more similar than different in their contents and in their theological emphases . And we looked at the central message of Jesus in lecture 1 , surrounding the kingdom of God . In lecture 2 , we looked at the ethical teachings of how His followers should live , that resulted from His conviction that the kingdom was already but not yet " that it had broken into human history , though not yet fully . And then in lecture 3 , we looked at the Christology , the self-understanding of Jesus implicitly and explicitly : Who and what did He claim to be ? We also looked at additional characteristics , as well as specific titles predicated of Him in the synoptic gospels . This culminated in a look at the synoptics ' understanding of the significance of His death and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this series , we are now turning to the dominant and distinctive features within each individual gospel . Since we began with the synoptics corporately , taken together , we proceeded in lecture 4 to return to them in the most probable order in which they were written . We looked at Mark first , because he is the shortest and because we can not compare him with any versions of the gospel that may have pre-dated him in narrative form . There is , by definition , the least that is distinctive , but certainly we saw numerous emphases that were dominant . Then , recognizing that we are really not in a position to determine if Matthew or Luke wrote one earlier than the other or both approximately the same time shortly after Mark , we simply reverted to the canonical sequence of the gospels . We looked at the distinctive and dominant theology of Matthew . In our final lecture , in tape 6 , we shall turn to the distinctive and dominant theology of the gospel of John . That leaves this talk to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theological Emphases in the Gospel of Luke <p> If this were a series dealing with the Gospels and Acts , we should have to take Luke and Acts together . And , indeed , any theme that appears dominant and distinctive in the gospel of Luke is well-served by turning to Luke 's second volume ( the Acts of the Apostles ) to see how that theme plays out after Jesus ' resurrection and ascension in the life of the first generation of Christianity . But our task is a more modest one here , focusing just on the gospel , much as we did with Matthew and Mark already . <p> As also with those two gospels , a brief introductory look at the structure ( or at least one plausible structure ) of the gospel , sets the stage nicely for consideration of distinctive themes . Mark was divided neatly into two main contrasting halves . And Matthew , more often than not , replicated material from Mark and in approximately the same order . Matthew also introduced it with a two-chapter infancy narrative and concluded it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuated Mark 's account with five major blocks of Jesus ' teaching , or sermonic material . <h> a . The Gospel of Luke Compared to the Gospel of Mark <p> So too we can examine the way Luke seemingly has both drawn on , as well as amplified and gone his own way , in elaborating Mark . Like Matthew , Luke too has a two-chapter infancy narrative ( Luke 1 and 2 ) . From 3:1 to 4:13 , we find introductory ministry material largely paralleled in Mark and/or Matthew . In 4:14 to 9:50 , Luke follows Mark 's structure reasonably closely for the major Galilean ministry , with the notable exception of leaving out , near the end of that period , that segment that has often been called Jesus ' withdrawal from Galilee . Source critics sometimes call this Luke 's great omission . <p> The most noteworthy and distinctive subsection of Luke 's gospel proceeds from 9:51 to at least 18:14 , in which we read that Jesus , at the outset of this segment , sets His face to go to Jerusalem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near . This is , thus , the climatic journey on the road to what will be His passion , crucifixion and resurrection . This is sometimes called Luke 's travel narrative , or otherwise simply just his central section . In terms of comparing Luke with the other gospels , what is most intriguing about it is that it is an almost nine-chapter segment , more than one-third of the gospel , with only the very briefest of parallels to Mark . Otherwise , it focuses on material either found elsewhere only in Matthew or that which is entirely unique to Luke , most of which in both of these last two categories are teachings rather than deeds . And a substantial percentage of these teachings are teachings in parables . <p> Beginning with 18:15 , Luke resumes following Mark 's outline , though not quite as closely in 4:14 to 9:50 . He intersperses some of his own distinctive material as well , through to the end of the gospel . After this he appends , after Christ 's death , another lengthier chapter " even lengthier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the resurrection . This is what we today know as Luke 24 . These may , at first glance , simply appear to be a collection of source critical observations with little theological relevance . But on closer inspection this is precisely not the case . <h> b . The Narrative in the Gospel of Luke Continued in the Book of Acts <p> Here is one place where it is important to be aware of what Luke does in his second volume in Acts . It has often been observed that Acts 1:8 forms a paradigm , or an outline in a nutshell , of the entire narrative flow of Luke 's second volume . Jesus tells the twelve that they shall be His witnesses , first in Jerusalem , then in Judea and Samaria , and ultimately to the uttermost parts of the world . We might add that technically there are only eleven at this point , but both Luke and John know of occasions when the expression " twelve " simply means the group of closest disciples to Christ . As the book of Acts unfolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The church in Jerusalem occupies the opening panel ( 1:1-6:7 ) . Then Stephen 's martyrdom leads to persecution and to the gospel expanding to Judea and to Samaria . And then ultimately the gospel expands throughout the Gentile world , culminating at the end of Acts with the gospel having made it as far as Rome . This may not be the uttermost parts of the known-world in the first century , but certainly reflected the capital city and heart of the empire that was in power over the vast majority of that part of the world that was known to the first apostles . <p> That outline reflects in reverse sequence precisely the geographical outline that results in the gospel of Luke , once one observes the ways in which Luke does or does not parallel Mark or Matthew . The opening chapters of Luke , despite parallels in part with the infancy narratives of Matthew , nevertheless go beyond what Matthew tells us " both in detail and also in placing the birth of Jesus squarely in the context of events of world history and Roman rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have , given the great omission ( given Luke 's omitting the withdrawal from Galilee ) , except for the briefest of excursions across the Sea of Galilee and back , almost entirely Jesus ministering in Galilee . Galilee had been known since Isaiah 's time in the eighth century B.C. as Galilee of the Gentiles , because of the greater Gentile population in that province of Israel than in either Samaria or in Judea to the south . From there the travel narrative finds Jesus navigating , in itinerant fashion , solely in Samaria and Judea . The passion narrative of Luke and indeed the resurrection appearances in Luke remain exclusively in and around Jerusalem , setting Luke 's narrative off in the this respect from the other gospels . <p> Thus , we have a kind of hourglass , or inverted parallel structure , for the outline of Luke and Acts together . From the birth of Jesus in the context of world history and Roman rule to Jesus in Galilee of the Gentiles to Samaria and Judea to Jerusalem with the resurrection narrated . The resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ascension briefly mentioned at the end of Luke . And then the ascension is more fully narrated at the beginning of Acts . Here is the climactic center of this extended chiasm , or inverted parallelism . And then the hourglass bends outward again with the church in Jerusalem , in Judea and Samaria , throughout the Gentile world and the preaching of the gospel by Paul extending as far as Rome , the heart and center of the known world of that day . <p> Luke is very much concerned to highlight the central significance of the resurrection and the ascension . He is to be , as it were , the first Christian historian thinking in terms of world events and not just Jewish history . He is one who thinks geographically , but who uses geography in service of theology . He is one who sees the focal point of the gospel in the person of Jesus of Nazareth coming to the Jerusalem temple , the focal point of God 's dealings with humanity to this point , only to spread outward again in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the uttermost parts of the earth . This parallels the picture of the Great Commission at the end of Matthew , of making disciples of all the peoples or of all the Gentiles. <h> c . Luke 's View of Jesus <h> 1 . Jesus ' Compassion for Outcasts <p> We should not be surprised , then , when we turn to distinctive or dominant views of Jesus , that we find His humanity shining through and His compassion for the outcast of His world more clearly and centrally in Luke than in any of the other gospels . Luke does , indeed , use such titles common to the others " such as Christ , Son of God , and Lord " but they are not nearly as prominent as they are elsewhere . What strikes most readers of Luke 's gospel is how Jesus ' humanity shines through . <p> Four groups of outcast stand out in particular , Samaritans and Gentiles ; tax-collectors and sinners ( an unusual expression linking one particularly notorious up-and-out category of individuals ( as opposed to down-and-out ) at least with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; thirdly women ; and fourthly the poorest of the poor . <p> i . Samaritans and Gentiles <p> As examples of Luke 's distinctive concern for Samaritans and Gentiles , only he records the Parable of the Good Samaritan ( 10:25-37 ) , or the Story of the Ten Lepers , the only one of which who returned to give thanks to Jesus for His physical healing and thus experiences spiritual healing , was surprisingly the Samaritan ( 17:11-19 ) . Jesus does not , because of the omission of the withdrawal from Galilee , minister directly to Gentiles in the ways that He does in Matthew and Mark . But such details as the sending of the servants a second time further afield to bring in more people to the master 's banqueting table in a parable like that of the Great Supper ( 14:23 ) may well hint at what certainly becomes a dominant theme " outreach to Gentiles wherever they may be found " by the time we reach the book of Acts . <p> ii . Tax-Collectors and Sinners <p> Tax-collectors and sinners are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last of these introduces the chapter of the three Parables of the Lost , culminating in the most famous and perhaps best illustration , the Parable of the Prodigal Son . See also the parable of the Pharisee and Tax-collector ( 18:9-14 ) and the conversion of Zacchaeus ( 19:1-10 ) . <p> iii . More Women Mentioned Specifically than in Other Gospels <p> Luke has far more women in his account than do the other gospels . The birth narratives appear recounted , it would seem , from the perspectives of Elizabeth and Mary " as opposed more to perhaps Joseph 's perspective at least in Matthew 1 . In addition to the male prophet Simeon , there appears the even more elderly female prophetess Anna , recognizing the birth of the Christ-child in the temple in Jerusalem ( 2:25-38 ) . Pairs of parables in distinctive fashion in Luke 's gospel balance male and female roles characteristic of the day " such as the Parables of the Mustard Seed and Leaven ( 13:18-21 ) , the man 's farming occupation , the woman 's bread-baking occupation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Both a woman and a man are healed of their crippling diseases on differing Sabbath days ( 13:10-17 ; 14:1-6 ) . And , in what no doubt was a scandalous event at the time , Jesus announces the forgiveness of sins and praises the unnamed prostitute 's behavior when she crashes the party at the house of Simon the Pharisee , let 's down her hair , anoints Jesus ' feet with oil and wipes the feet with her hair . One modern commentator on the gospel of Luke , Joel Green , has likened this action to a woman appearing in a formal dinner party in the Western world today topless . Jesus , in Luke , also praises Mary 's devotion to His teaching , over against the culturally expected domestic duties of Martha ( 10:38-42 ) . And it is only in the gospel of Luke where we read and hear of the names of those more well-to-do women ( 8:1-3 ) who formed what today might be called the support team of Jesus and the apostles . They paid for their traveling provisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in context that would have , at the very least , left the door open for great suspicions of scandal in Jesus ' day . <p> iv . Jesus ' Ministry to the Poor <p> For examples of His ministry to the poor in Luke , we may consider the fact that the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Plain ( beginning Luke 6:20 ) speak literally of you poor being blessed , rather than the poor in spirit as in Matthew . Or , in Jesus ' headline synagogue sermon at Nazareth ( 4:18 ) , He pronounces the fulfillment of the ministry of the anointed Spirit of the Lord as prophesied in Isaiah to preach good news to the poor . The various teachings in the Parable of the Great Supper and the introductory illustrations that lead into it ( 14:7-24 ) all demonstrate God 's concern for the sick and dispossessed , who are unable to help themselves or return favors . And the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus ( 16:19-31 ) vindicates the neglected , presumably pious poor man ( since his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but obviously godless , unnamed dweller and feaster in luxury , who recognizes at the end that his family has not repented or become right with God . Presumably thus he acknowledges that his lot in this earthly life had been similar . <h> 2 . Savior <p> A title that is entirely distinctive to the gospel of Luke , and at the same time , perhaps , best sums up the themes of his focus on Jesus ' compassion for outcasts and His humanity , is Savior . In the famous Christmas-card text ( 2:11 ) , the angel announces : " Today in the City of David is born to you a Savior who is Christ the Lord . " We find the term again in Luke 19:10 in its verbal cognate or equivalent word . Howard Marshall and others have speculated that this text best sums up the theology of all of the gospel of Luke : " The Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost . " <h> 3 . Prophet <p> Another subordinate title , at least in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account is Jesus ' resurrection of the son of the widow of Nain ( 7:11-17 ) . Near the end of this paragraph , the crowds recognize presumably the parallels to Elisha 's resurrection of the Shunammite widow 's son ( 2 Kings 4:8-37 ) . They respond that a great prophet has appeared among us . Elsewhere in a passage found only in Luke ( 13:33 ) , Jesus refers to Himself as a prophet . Several scholars have found the entire travel narrative , or central section , echoing key themes of Deuteronomy " including Jesus sent , as Moses had been , as God 's messenger prophetically warning a hardhearted and stiff-necked generation about its coming destruction , and yet experiencing predominantly rejection nevertheless . Indeed , Luke 's distinctive use of the Old Testament is best summed up as a prophetic , as well as Christological use . All of the Scriptures point to Him and must be fulfilled by Him ( see especially Luke 24:25 and 44 ) . <h> 4 . Jesus Teaches in Parables <p> If in Matthew Jesus is the teacher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the teacher preeminently in parables . Of the roughly 40 passages most commonly classified as parables in the gospels , approximately 28 appear in Luke and 15 are unique to this particular gospel . Unlike some of the more enigmatic narratives in Mark and Matthew , many of Luke 's parables are less cryptic and more straightforward . They offer simple examples to be imitated , or at least offer that much with perhaps bonus insights for more expert Christians . One thinks , especially again of the Parable of the Good Samaritan , but also of the Rich Fool ( 12:13-21 ) and the Rich Man and Lazarus ( 16:19-31 ) and the Parable of the Pharisee and Tax-collector ( 18:9-14 ) . <h> 5 . Jesus as the Resurrected and Exalted One , and Benefactor <p> Finally , there is some distinctive and/or dominant emphasis in the gospel of Luke , as we have already seen , to Jesus as the resurrected and the exalted One and also to Jesus as benefactor . Luke 22:24-30 deals with servanthood , but without the distinctive and crucial Suffering Servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , no doubt , the one Gentile author in the New Testament writing to the most Gentile of audiences ( possibly in and around Antioch , or else in Achaia in Greece , some have even suggested Philippi in the northern half of Greece in the province of Macedonia ) , Luke has perhaps a slightly more well-to-do clientele . Hence the warnings about the dangers of wealth , and not to follow the cultural presuppositions of patronage of that practice of reciprocity where one favor always demands another in return . Unlike the typical Greek benefactor who must be paid back for caring for the needy , Christians are not to treat their fellow believers that way . Rather they are to see God as the only benefactor " the One who they can not literally pay back at all , because He gives His mercy in a wholly undeserved fashion . They are to respond in gratitude , with a life of service to Him ( recall again 14:12-14 ) . <h> d . Themes in the Gospel of Luke <h> 1 . Stewardship of Material Possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these , including a broad interest in the theme of riches and poverty and , more specifically , of the stewardship of material possessions by those who have a surplus . Closely related to His concern for the poor is Jesus ' emphasis on His followers not accumulating or hoarding riches for themselves . It is only in Luke where , rather than eight beatitudes as in Matthew , Luke balances his four beatitudes which he has chosen to present , with four woes against the opposite characteristic traits " the rich , the well-fed , the laughing and well-spoken of , but those who do not share in the Christian commitment and the Christian commitment to the poor and the needy and the sorrowful and the maligned as the outgrowth of that allegiance to Jesus . <p> Only Luke has the poetic statements , possibly even hymnic outbursts , by Mary and Zechariah in the opening chapters in the infancy narratives of Luke 1 and 2 . These describe what some have called the great reversal , with the powerful brought down from their thrones and positions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parables of the Rich Fool and the Rich Man and Lazarus fit in here and warn sharply those who spend all their riches simply to improve their own lifestyles or standards of living . The Unjust Steward ( 16:1-13 ) is commended , not for his injustice , but for his shrewd use of wealth . Believers must model this trait , but use their wealth wisely for kingdom objectives . <p> Not all Christians are called to give up everything as the rich , young ruler was ( 18:18-30 ) . Indeed , he is the only character in all of the Bible who is so challenged . Zacchaeus , shortly afterwards in chapter 19 , voluntarily gives up half and promises to restore fourfold to any he has defrauded . And the Parable of the Minas or Pounds ( 19:11-27 ) suggests it is possible even to invest money and make more of it , as long as one recognizes that one will be held accountable for all of it , because all of it is on loan from the master . Again , there is no fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away or to keep . The point is they must be good stewards of all of it . But giving generously and sacrificially , at least for the more well-to-do nations of the world and their inhabitants , usually requires giving considerably more than a tenth of one 's annual income rather than justifying giving less . <h> 2 . The Question of the Jews ' Ongoing Obedience to the Law <p> The theme of the Jewish people and the question of their ongoing obedience to the law is an issue for the gospel of Luke , that becomes even more prominent in the Acts of the Apostles . Some have wondered if Luke has , in fact , a more positive view of Judaism and the Jewish leaders than the other gospels do . For example , Pharisees invite Jesus to their homes ( chapters 7 and 14 ) . Jewish leaders warn him about Herod ( 13:31 ) . The gospel climaxes and Acts begins with Jesus in and around the temple in Jerusalem which Luke acknowledges as God 's holy place ( Acts 6 ) . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how individuals during Jesus ' ministry and in the decades afterwards still obey Jewish law in the gospel alone ( see for example 1:6 ; 1:59 ; 2:21-24 ) . <p> On the other hand , it would appear that Luke 's emphases , when he deviates from his sources , particularly by the time we see the gospel moving out to ever less and less Jewish territory in the book of Acts , suggests otherwise . While it is certainly a historical fact that there was no single day or month or year before or after Jesus ' death and resurrection when His followers all realized that the sacrificial system of the temple , and therefore the entire Mosaic law , could no longer be obeyed in unchanged fashion and therefore no longer need be so followed . It appears rather that Luke 's emphasis , given the ever-outward focus of the geographical and cultural expansion of the gospel , is that , in spite of the transitional period of the days surrounding Jesus ' life and death , he is more concerned to show how the gospel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means to salvation or as a required necessary body of principles that Jesus ' followers must obey " at least , without understanding how these might be fulfilled in Christ and therefore changed in application . <h> 3 . Luke as the First Christian Historian <p> We have already seen how Luke can be thought of as the first Christian historian , not least because he is the only one we know of who does go on to pin a book like the Acts of the Apostles as a sequel a gospel . He recognizes Jesus ' story as simply one more epic in unfolding world history and of the history of salvation , or of God 's dealings with humanity . And he recognizes the age begun at Pentecost , what many since have often called the church age , as being the era or epic that follows this . <h> 4 . The Gospel of Luke has Less of an Emphasis on Imminent Eschatology <p> Closely tied to this line of historical thinking is less of an emphasis on imminent eschatology ( the very soon return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that the parousia ( or second coming of Jesus ) might be somewhat delayed . Thus , the teachings of Jesus in Luke can , more so than in other gospels , allow for the possibility that someone may have to fear death or at least deal with the prospect of death prior to Christ 's return as the way in which one 's earthly life will end ( see for example the Parable of the Rich Fool , and again , of the Rich Man and Lazarus , or even that of the thief on the cross and Jesus ' promise to him in 23:43 that today he should be with Him in paradise ) . Parables like those of the Watchful Servants ( 12:35-38 ) or the introduction to the Parable of the Pounds ( 19:11 ) , as well as the additional material about the times of the Gentiles in which the temple in Jerusalem will be overrun in Christ 's Olivet Discourse ( 21:20-24 ) , all play down an overly enthusiastic approach to the necessarily immediate return of Jesus , while never completely ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17:20-37 balances both present and future hope with respect to eschatology . But it is clearly the future that has receded in importance in Luke , compared to Mark and Matthew , and the present , the already of the already not yet to mention , that comes to the fore . This trend will simply become even more prominent when we turn to the gospel of John . <h> 5 . The Role of Satan <p> Additional themes in the survey of the dominant and distinctive theology of the gospel of Luke include the role of Satan . It would appear that he comes , not merely in the temptation narratives at the beginning of Jesus ' public period of ministry ( see 4:1ff ) in a particularly heinous fashion , but after departing ( see the end of that passage in 4:12-13 ) , only to await an opportune time to reappear . Temporary such times appear when Jesus encounters demons and has to exorcise them from individuals they are possessing . A particularly prominent moment comes after the sending out of the seventy ( 10:18-19 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make demons flee and Jesus praises His Heavenly Father that Satan has fallen from heaven like lightening . But at 22:31 , he returns with a flurry of hostile activity , entering into Judas Iscariot and preparing him for his acts of betraying Jesus over to the Jewish authorities . Nevertheless , all of Luke , like the book of Acts , is pervaded by a progression of events that can scarcely leave in doubt Luke 's conviction that God , with a sovereign plan , is in charge . <h> 6 . God through the Holy Spirit Guides and Controls History <p> Indeed , a still further dominant and distinctive piece of Luke 's theology reflects a primary way in which God is in charge and guides the events of human history , namely by His Holy Spirit . The Spirit appears considerably more often in Luke than in Matthew and Mark . Characteristic expression in both Luke and Acts is that someone is filled with the Spirit " a phenomenon that can recur repeatedly in the same individual or a group of individuals and always leads to bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example Luke 1:15 , 41 ; Acts 2:4 ; 4:31 ) . The Holy Spirit empowers Jesus but also all of His followers for many other kinds of ministries too . <p> i . Prayer <p> One of these is prayer , another dominant and distinctive theme in Luke , at least relatively speaking . Prayer is the central focus of three parables unique to this gospel : the Friend at Midnight ( 11:5-8 ) , the Persistent Widow ( 18:1-8 ) and the Pharisee and Tax-collector ( 18:9-14 ) . And it features prominently and distinctively at key moments in Christ 's own life ( see for example 5:16 ; 6:12 ; 9:18 , 28 ) . <p> ii Joy <p> Yet again , another distinctive and somewhat more common aspect of life in the Spirit in the gospel of Luke is joy . The infancy narratives are filled with joyful hymns or poetic prose . And the word joy ( Greek chara ) and its cognates is unusually common throughout the gospel ( for example 1:14 ; 2:10 ; 10:17 ; 15:7 , 10 ) . And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise more frequent in Luke than in other gospels. <h> 7 . Summary <p> What are we to make of all of these distinctives ? We have seen that Mark was the gospel written to , first of all , Roman Christians in the 60s as suffering was intensifying or on the verge of intensifying . The failures of the twelve were , in a somewhat backhanded way , meant to comfort and encourage those who felt inadequate to the task of discipleship in Rome . They knew that , despite those failures , the disciples were subsequently forgiven and used mightily . <p> We have seen that Matthew is the most Jewish of the synoptics and perhaps of all four of the gospels . It has the greatest links to the Old Testament . And yet , it also has some of the most sharply critical words for the Jewish leaders . It reflects the context of the " synagogue across the street " , which has recently broken fellowship with and expelled those of its members who have acknowledged Jesus as their Messiah . <p> Luke , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most uniformly Gentile of Christian audiences . Theophilus is a Greek name . He is one who is either a seeker or inquirer after the God of the Christians or a young convert . This leads Luke ( 1:4 ) to explain that he is writing so that Theophilus might know the certainty of the things about which he has been taught . Luke , then , is also more likely the gospel writer who is , as a physician , perhaps slightly better off . Certainly doctors in the ancient world did not consistently enjoy the high socioeconomic standing they do today . Even more probably he is writing to a Christian church in the larger Gentile world that is beginning to have a slightly larger minority of what we would call middle- or even upper-class followers of Jesus . He is helping them to recognize the dangers of materialism and a key way of avoiding them : namely , generous , even sacrificial stewardship of material possessions , as well as a focus on the needs even more generally of the poor and outcast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of these themes clearly prove crucial in today 's dramatically variegated world as well . 
@@35723283 @4723283/ <h> The Philosophical Theology of Sankara and Ramanuja <p> You have to kind of come down on some basic interpretation of it , so we have chosen , this class , to do kind of the standard interpretation of the Upanishads and that is that of Sankara . We closed the last period by highlighting some of the great statements made about Sankara . He 's been called one of the great magnitudes of philosophical and theological history . He 's been called one of the great metaphysical tendencies in the history of human thought " not just Indian thought , but the history of human thought . He 's been called India 's greatest philosopher and the pinnacle of India 's philosophical contribution to the world Ramanuja will call him one steeped in darkness who does n't know how to utter a true statement . But Sankara is widely regarded as a great philosopher and I think represents what I call the Platonic tendency in Eastern thought . Ramanuja will definitely be the Aristotelian emphasis on particulars . Just to refresh our memory on some of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past we have kind of ploughed through in a lot of detail , but most of it we 've already discussed . So I 'm going to just kind of go through it briefly to remind you of Sankara 's interpretation of monism grows out of his understanding of tat twam asi which essentially identifies the essence of humanity with the essence of the universe . So the distinction between enjoyers and objects of enjoyment does not exist . So he wants to erase subject/object dichotomy and instead identify that everything is Brahman . We 're going to see how Ramanuja basically accepts this but with a lot of qualifications of what this means in the second sentence . But all must either be identified with Brahman or dismissed as ultimately unreal . So he wants to create a situation where the entire world is an illusory Maya state and the only thing that is identical with Brahman is atman . <p> He deals with the whole quality of Brahman issue by focusing on the nirguna/saguna distinction which is absolutely critical to the whole Advaitic position . Everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he use as his hermeneutical technique that must be referring to Isvara . This is saguna Brahman . Sankara follows a very rigorous monism " or rigorous non-dualism " in the sense that he 's not going to accept any statements that show qualities or attributes of Brahman . If whenever Brahman is worshipped with forms and qualities or , I 'm quoting him now , it 's spoken of as if it were embodied . This is only because of ignorance . So therefore , in light of all of our discussion of popular Hinduism , and all of the avatars of Vishnu and so forth , all of that discussion of god being embodied has to be at the level of saguna which must be relegated ultimately to illusory " less than real capital " R " . And therefore it ultimately will fail you . It ultimately has no ability to help you achieve a moksa . The only hope is proper knowledge . So , he definitely responds to all the conflicting texts in the Upanishads by creating these two levels of Brahman . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted in Svetasvatara Upanishad in our great Mahavakya passages . There are two forms of Brahman . The form and the formless , the mortal and the immortal , the unmoving , the moving , the actual and the true being which he interprets as being nirguna/saguna . Ramanuja , we 'll see later , interprets this as manifested/unmanifested . He interprets it a bit differently than Sankara does . <p> Then I thought I would just expose you ... you do not need to know these quotes , but I thought it would be helpful just to expose you to a little bit of some of Sankara 's actual writing " to give you a little feel for kind of his argumentation . He 's such a classic Middle Ages thinker . Ramanuja as well . They both think very much like the great philosophers of this time period of thought and they argue along these terms . And this is typical of what Sankara might say in his ... in this case this comes from his Brahmasutra Bhashya " his commentary on the Brahmasutras . When a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he points to the locus where the body is burned or cut and not to the perceiver , saying : " I have pain in the head or in the chest or in the stomach . " If pain or the cause of pain , such as burning and cutting were located in the perceiver , he would point to the perceiver as the locus of pain . <p> OK , this is Sankara trying desperately to distinguish between the experience of the world and the atman , the " I " . So when someone says : " I am in pain . My head hurts . " " they do n't point to their atman . So the word " I " is being used in some secondary sense . " I have pain " is actually saying my head is hurting , my stomach is hurting , or whatever . It 's very interesting how Sankara and Ramanuja will reinterpret how we use the word " I " . It 's very , very important in not only Hindu philosophy , but Buddhist philosophy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are largely preoccupied with debates about the " I " because of Buddhism . Buddhism is a really remarkable movement . We have n't obviously developed in this class , but Buddhism is probably sustained the most powerful blow to Hinduism that Hinduism has yet to absorb . Christianity will ultimately be the final shattering blow to Hinduism . But we 've been unable to actually get our fist in the proper position to drop the blow and so it has n't yet happened . But , Buddhism was able to formulate a very powerful critique of Hinduism that really Hinduism is still reeling from . <p> And so Sankara is extremely preoccupied in his writings with the fact that he 's not a ... proving that he 's not a Buddhist . He 's very , very upset people might call him a Buddhist . If you want to get an Advaitic person upset , say to him : " You 're a Buddhist . I know you are . You really believe in the annihilation of the self . " Ooh . This really gets them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot with this how we use the word " I " . Listen to this quote of his . A man possessed by nescience " this means ignorance " avija " being differentiated by body , etc , think that his atman is connected with things desirable and undesirable . This is the basic problem that we 've already looked at of the Upanishadic vision " before you get to the point of tat twam asi , aham Brahman and all that , is that you are connecting your " I " , your self , with various associations with your body and your experience . But the scripture gradually removes his ignorance concerning this matter and uproots nescience which is the view that atman is different from Brahman . Because this is just standard stuff we 've already looked at " that the root of ignorance is saying that you 're at ... I have an " I " which is other than Brahman . He says this typically " and this is typical ? ? ? of all of Sankara . He says this by way of negation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from Brahman and therefore true knowledge is the association of atman with Brahman which is tat twam asi . So all of this is kind of standardised by Sankara . <p> And I do n't really believe that the Hinduism , Hindu philosophy , as we know it today , was really properly articulated in the way that it 's today done until the 8th century AD . So it 's a long time before we get this kind of crystal clear nirguna/saguna and all of that tat twam asi interpretation along these lines . It does n't actually occur until Sankara . It actually burns more dramatic after Sankara because I think his followers tended to take it even farther and even more emphasise the unreality of the world . <p> I had this problem with my dissertation . I had this problem with my book . Some of those who were critical of my dissertation book were critical because they felt like I was too easy on Sankara " and I did not emphasise as much as I should have the fact that the Advaitans teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that in fact it is not Sankara who does this . It is Sankarites . It 's just like , in my opinion , what happened with Calvin . I mean , you say Calvinism , you have n't always said Calvin . I mean , you say Calvin and you talk about the Synod of Dort , there 's a migration that goes on . And maybe it 's true to the spirit of Calvin , but maybe it 's not . But these are two different realities . And so you have to be very , very careful about how we define what is being said by Calvin and what 's being said by the followers of Calvin ; what 's said by Sankara , what 's said by the followers of Sankara . So , these are some of the issues that you have to dealt with . <p> The only thing I ... on the handout which I have n't mentioned at this point is neti-neti . Did we discuss this in the original lecture on the Upanishadic vision " neti-neti ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here as a translation . This is a Sanskrit expression which means not this " neti-neti " not this , not this . It comes from the Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad , section 2 , chapter 3 , verse 6 . And essentially , what happens in that passage is the inquiring student presses the teacher about Brahman 's attributes . And the teacher says to him : " Neti-neit . " OK , this is really important . This comes up a lot in the literature because it is a nice little summary statement . In many ways it 's like a Mahavakya . It 's a great utterance " neti-neti " because it summarises the overall position of the Advaitans " that you can not say anything about Brahman with certainty . And so , if you say : " God is love . " Well , neti-neti " not this , not this " you ca n't make those ? ? ? " God is just . " Neti-neti . They always respond with neti-neti . And so , when you 're discussing with Adviatans or they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neti-neti . Yes . <p> Question : Unless you say god is truth , consciousness , bliss ? <p> If you Brahman is sat cit ananda , that 's fine as long as those are indicators of Brahman . They 're viewed as indicators , not necessarily as attributes or qualities of Brahman . I mean , it may be a fine distinction but ... I mean , one of the problems is that if you say neti-neti to everything , the philosophical weakness of it is that you could be interpreted to say that this is just nothing more than a great void . I mean , if you ca n't say anything about something , then it can be nothing " which the Buddhists say it is . See Buddhists say : " It 's nirvana " nothingness . " It 's shunyata they call it . So shunyata is nothingness . The last thing that Sankara will accept is that Brahman is nothingness . And so the sat cit ananda stuff kind of helps create some way of contrasting their position with the Buddhist . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the absolute is reality , knowledge , infinity . This is a slight variation of sat cit ananda . I mean , this would go into another whole thing , but actually , when Sankara was writing , that particular Upanishad was not well known . We 're not absolutely sure that Sankara was aware of that particular Upanishad where it says sat cit ananda . That 's a little side thing . If that troubles you , then forget it . But it was in the literature , the discussion that Brahman is sat cit anantwi " it means infinity . This later migrates to this other thing of bliss . That 's a long kind of discourse . Anyway , in one of his writings , the Brahmasutra Bhashya , he says : " The absolute is reality , knowledge , infinity . " This is referring to that earlier kind of phrase . " It is the absolute that has been defined because the absolute is being presented as the primary thing that one has to know . Therefore the reason why the words reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are set in the same grammatical case as the word for the absolute and in apposition with it is that they represent the characteristics by which it is to be defined . Now that is the most strongest statement he makes that seems to indicate the closest thing to some kind of definition of Brahman . But he does n't say definition . He says this is a characterisation . This is indication . He uses kind of that whole thing . <p> He makes the example of if you want to distinguish for example , a blue lotus from a red lotus , then you use expressions like blue lotus to distinction from a red lotus . So these are things that distinguish in by way of negation that everything that is not this is denied . So it 's that kind of apathetic boundaries essentially is how he deals with this . <p> OK . Let 's move on to the Maya which we 've also discussed quite a bit . If Brahman is the only reality there is , then how do we account for the seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the key problem . I want you to think about this question , because this is actually a question that you should be able to answer . How does Sankara respond to this question ? How does Ramanuja respond to this question " because essentially both Sankara and Ramanuja are seeking to answer this question . <p> Sankara answers it with the doctrine of Maya . We 've examined that already . So Brahman is the only reality . Atman is identified with Brahman . And everything else is Maya . Everything else is this lower level of ? ? ? " neither real nor unreal , in this less than real state . Maya has been called the key concept around which his , that is , Sankara 's , entire system revolves . And that is an understatement . It 's very , very important to Sankara " his understanding of Maya . So , Maya for Sankara is a way to deal with all of the potential problems of differentiation , of particularity , all the things that we see " we come to Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphors . I 'll just remind you of that whole discussion . That 's exactly a discussion that flows out ... I mean , he does n't actually this line of argumentation in his writings , but that he definitely draws upon metaphors from all three of these categories . This has been a later analysis of Sankara and I used it to demonstrate the hermeneutical technique of Indian . But you remember how I told you , rather than speaking about something directly , they speak indirectly by looking at stars around the mystery and they point to it . This is the arundhati hermeneutic . You remember that ? We discussed that ? OK . So in the same way , whenever he 's discussing Maya , this is where the Sankarites took off and they took one of these metaphors and they began to propagate it in the West . So most Western textbooks make the mistake of taking the subjective delusion metaphors and assuming that that 's Maya . And there 's plenty of Sankarite quotes to back it up . But see , Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to actually take into account all of his metaphors to grasp the mystery of Maya . And we spent a good bit of time exploring that when we looked at the concept of Maya , and I pretty much kind of toed the Sankarite line at that point because that 's the starting point for any discussion of Hindu philosophy . OK , so there 's point in re ... going through that . <p> Moksa therefore is the breaking of ignorance . It is the liberation from the effects of karma . So , Sankara is very much focused on the whole jnana " the priority of knowledge . And moksa is breaking the ignorance " so that thinks that we 're attached to the world in some way . And Maya is the liberation from the effects of karma . And he this famous saying of Sankara even included here in transliteration from the Sanskrit " Brahma satyam jagan mithya jeevo Brahmaiva na aparah . Brahman is real . You can see the satyam " Brahman is reality . The world is unreality " jeevo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahman . And that really summarises in that little phrase " that 's again a kind of a little Mahavakya in a way . But this is a summary of Sankara . If properly understood : Brahman is real , the world is unreal , the individual is not different from Brahman . To be technically accurate , you should read this as : Brahman is real ( capital " R " ) , the world is not real ( capital " R " ) " to keep you from reading this as total allusion . But essentially , this is the way it 's often translated and this leads to some of the misunderstandings of it . But essentially Sankara , this is his phrase . Brahman is real ( capital " R " ) , the world is not real , the individual is non-different from Brahman , referring to the atman , the locus of the " I " . <p> So for Sankara , going back to our three points of tension that we looked at throughout the course in our three margas on the chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back to which gives us our overall structure , this is the way Sankara 's going to view it . Works and devotion are only valuable if they lead to true knowledge . And I 'll even add that once you come to true knowledge , this does not serve as a foundation point . It 's not like a foundation you build on to get to this . Once you achieve true knowledge with Sankara , this passes away . This drops off . And so he does n't actually value this as an ongoing reality , but as something that will simply help you in your rebirth to be born as a Brahmin . <p> That was a very brief , but hopefully we ... because of time , I do n't want to spend a lot of time rehashing through Sankara , and that 's been kind of our default throughout the course . So , what I really want to do is focus on how Ramanuja is different from Sankara . But any questions to clarify Sankara or any of the basic Upanishadic vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarify if that needs to be done . Yes . <p> Question : I 'm just curious that you said that Christianity could ? ? ? you know ? ? ? blow to Hinduism but we had to take advantage and find the right spot . <p> Well , I 'm actually speaking more historically than I am methodologically . I mean , I think that obviously that in the cross and the resurrection of Christ the decisive blow has been delivered . So , I do n't really see that we have anything that we can do . I mean , what needs to be done 's already been done . The question is : How is the reality ... the inbreaking of the kingdom , how can that be known in a way that the Hindus recognise that their system is simply a house of cards built upon itself with no foundation ? And I think that has not been well communicated . And a lot of it 's because Hindus , as a rule , have so many associations with Western culture and various things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel properly and we have n't done a very good job of actually creating the proper discourse in their languages so there 's been communicated in their own language . <p> So there 's a lot of layers of problems that we 're trying to address , but the most important being that we 're training north Indians to plant church among north Indians . That 's the best way . Because , as Andrew Walls beautifully says in his book , The Cross-Cultural Process in Christian History , his second collection of his writings , he says : The sign of the church is not a converted individual but a worshipping community . I really think that the church in India has never actually realised that point . We have been spending 2000 years trying to save individuals in India out of Hinduism . But we 've never really seen the importance of creating believing communities that can transform the society and live out what does it mean to be a member of the body of Christ in a Hindu , predominantly Hindu , society . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by little . Yes . <p> Question : You 're statement about Hinduism being a house of cards raises in my mind the question of why someone like CS Lewis would hold it in such high regard . <p> Well , let me just clarify what CS Lewis says , and I do n't mean ... maybe the house of cards analogy should n't be taken as a wipe-out of my entire course . I hope that I have demonstrated over the whole course of this , hours and hours of lectures on this , that I take this very seriously " and that I respect that the Hindu worldview is internally consistent within itself . My real point was saying : It just has no proper ontological foundation in my view . Therefore , what CS Lewis said about his comment about Hindu ... if he was n't a Christian , he 'd be a Hindu was simply to affirm the fact that he acknowledged that Hinduism had a coherent structure once you accept their presuppositions . If you ? ? ? the presuppositions then OK you can build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , if CS Lewis was not totally convinced of the Christian faith , he would abandon it . And so he was a committed Christian , not Hindu . But he was simply acknowledging the fact that this is a well-thought out system . It 's not just something you can dismiss . I think that 's basically all he 's saying . Did you have a question ? I 'm sorry , I forgot to ... <p> Question : What is ashram ? <p> Ahh . Ashram . I 'm sorry . We did not mention that , did we ? Or mutha . Yeah , it 's pronounced like mut , like a dog that 's ahh that 's like mut . Ashram refers to the ... what happened was ... when the Hindu philosophers , they did n't just teach in like seminaries . This is a big ... from the second notion . We think about Western philosophers who are writing in some university in an endowed chair writing books . But these are actually men that start communities of followers that live together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of devotees and saints that live together . Gandhi started an ashram . There are many , many Hindus over the centuries that started ashrams . So the ashram represents more of kind of like the disciple/guru community where they just live together . <p> A matha is much more than that . A matha is a bit closer to what we would call a seminary . A matha ? ? ? be a place where you actually train people in your philosophical thought . It 's much more of a formalised ... even though they all live there . I mean , it 's a community too . A matha is simply an advanced ashram . It 's not that you take away the ashram aspect , but it 's a much more advanced place where you actually promulgate the philosophy and you focus on explicit teaching , formalised teaching on , much like we 're doing here . Sankara and Ramanuja both established at least four mathas , where they would establish these to promulgate their teaching . And this is partly how their teaching became so widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around India . Yes . <p> Question : ? ? ? <p> How do you spell it ? <p> Response : Yeah . <p> I 'm sorry . It 's on the handout . It 's m-a-t-h is the singular . The plural 's m-a-t-h-a . It 's just pronounced a " mut . It 's like ... everybody says bhukti but it 's actually bhakti . People say Bhukti Hinduism " it 's actually ... it 's a ah . Interesting thing about Sanskrit " it is not an alphabet . Have they taught you that yet in your ... are you still doing Sanskrit class ? I mean , are you taking Hindi class ? Have they told you it 's not an alphabet yet ? <p> Response : I figured that out . <p> You figured it out the first day , OK . It is n't the same as just learning letters in alphabet , because you actually have what 's called a syllabury " which means you actually have ... and this is so insightful in Hinduism ... every letter is a vocalised letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ah , bah , cah . It 's like that . But in Hinduism every consonant has a default ah sound attached to it . So you can not have " OK Jeff I 'll give you a test here . What letter is this ? <p> Response : it 's the lah sound . <p> Ah . You see , he did n't say l , he went lah . If you do n't do anything that 's lah . If you want a long a you do that . It 's laah . If you want to say lee , you put that . That 's lee . If you want to say lah , you put that " lah . There 's all kinds of ways you can put vowels on it , but that consonant is not just a ... like our letter l . It 's always a lah . And so it effects the way everything ... That 's why when you 're listening to Sanskrit it sounds so musical because ah ah ah ah ah is constantly in there . It creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that the first day , so I 'm sure you 're much more advanced than that . Anyway . <p> Question : Are you going to comment on the sacred thread ? <p> I mentioned that last time . The sacred thread is part of the investiture of the ... I forgot again to bring it into the class . I apologise . I have one in my office . You 'll probably be disappointed if I bring it in . It 's just a dirty ... string . But anyway it 's ... when you become a certain age , you take on the ... it 's like a Bar Mitzvah for a Jew ... you take on the associations and the responsibilities of being a Brahmin male and they invest you with the sacred cord . And so it 's just a sign of a Brahmin . In some parts of India it can be worn by all high caste " Brahmin , Kshatriya , Vaisya " but that 's actually not proper . I mean , technically it 's only the Brahmin males that wear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to wear it . In fact , one of the big dividing points in the Brahmo Samaj , which is a 19th century reform movement , was debate about whether you should cast off the sacred thread or not . So , if you 're a Brahmin that believes in the reform of the caste that we want to ... you know , we do n't like being known as dominant and crushing people and we want to care for the Dalits and all that . The way you show that is to publicly cast off your cord to show , you know , I 'm just one of you , kind of thing . So there 's many dramatic examples in history of people ... they 'll say cast off the sacred thread . It 's a symbolic way of saying , you know , I 'm just one of you and all that . It happens at various points in history . So the term sacred thread is a term you should know . <p> OK , moving on to Ramanuja . Ramanuja occurs much later than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very developed Sankarite thought which is known as Advaitism . And Ramanuja writes a number of famous commentaries " his Sri Bhashya , his Brahmasutra Bhashya . The word Bhashya " this is their word for commentary . The Brahmasutra you already know about from our early part of the class . This is the writings of the philosophers " early Brahmins about the Brahmananas . Sri Bhashya " this is the lord 's commentary , the master 's commentary " things like that . These are two of his . You do n't need to know these commentaries , but they 're two of his more famous ones . <p> And it 's from these writings primarily , though I quote a few others , that I get Ramanuja 's thinking . His system is not known as Advaita . We 've talked a lot about Vedanta . Vedanta is actually divided into three major schools of thought . Vedanta , of course , is that part of the philosophy , the six schools on your chart . You 'll see that the sixth school of philosophy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Response : End of the Vedas . <p> End of the Vedas . And what is the end of the Vedas ? <p> Response : The Upanishads . <p> The Upanishads . So these philosophical schools that focus on the Upanishads are known as Vedanta . People often , incorrectly , when they say Vedanta , begin to blab on about Advaita . And you 'll often find , even textbooks will equate Advaita with Vedanta . But actually Advaita 's one school of Vedanta . Vedanta is the main category and then you have three major schools underneath it . You have the Advaita which is this one . This is Sankara " what we 've been looking at so far . It 's ? ? ? by Sankara . And then you have the Visistadvaita which is the Ramanuja , which we 'll look at . And then you have a form of dualism which is by a guy named Madhva " which we have not discussed and will not discuss in this class . He is not one of the things that we will have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a school that rejects the whole conception of monism . But it is a later development . It has influences outside of India . And I do n't think it 's actually true to the Upanishadic vision . So , we have n't really discussed this dualistic school of Madhva . We have discussed this quite a bit . And now we 're to briefly begin to develop the Ramanuja school . So , Vedanta , the main thing to know is Vedanta is the umbrella . And you have various sub-schools within it . <p> We 've looked at Sankara and he is the Plato . Ramanuja is the Aristotle . His view is called Visistadvaita . This is the word for two " dwa . So it has the privative a in front of it , just the way we use like words like atheism . This means not . Not two " non-dualism . OK , you have the same thing here with Ramanuja . You have ... he continues to word Advaita , but he adds the prefix to it Visista " which means modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the basic Advaitic principle of Sankara , but he 's going to modify it . And that modification is extremely important for our study in this class . Non-dualism is still the determining factor for Ramanuja . He is going to fully accept monism . However , he is going to modify it by embracing differentiation and particularity . This is the why I call it Aristotelian thrust . He 's going to find a way to reconcile plurality in his monism . Particularity , differentiation " that 's very , very important to Ramanuja as we will see . <p> I want to quote from Ramanuja here . I did n't put this on the overhead , but it 's ... I just ... I love Raman ... the way they write because they write with such force . Today , we do n't write that way . We 're always so careful . You know , we 're always qualifying everything . We have n't really learned to write the way they wrote . Or they had n't learned to write the way we write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they attacked their opponents with just ... I mean , absolutely all guns blazing . I mention some of the things he said . This is one of he talks about Sankara 's inability to embrace differentiation , particularity . He describes Sankara 's philosophy as quote " this is actual Ramanuja quote : A fictitious foundation of altogether hollow and vicious arguments from one whose intellect is darkened and has no insight into the meaning of words and sentences . Can you imagine saying that about somebody ? I mean , this is not like your typical ETS where , you know , with the greatest respect , you know , my dear colleague , blah , blah , blah , blah . You know , this guy .. can you imagine saying , you know : Your intellect is darkened . You do n't even know the meaning of words and sentences . I mean , this is not something that ... no one 's ever called my arguments hollow and vicious . It 's another world . <p> But the real question that we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or non-dualism the way they would say it , but I 'm using the Western terminology . How do you reconcile monism or non-dualism with Ramanuja 's enthusiastic embrace of particulars . That is the real big question . If you can answer that question , then you 'll be in great shape . <p> The way he answers it is to recast what it means to talk about Brahman . What he does is , he argues that Brahman is a personality which comprehends within himself all plurality . This is what he calls monism of the differenced . This is a one essence with internal differentiation . So , if you could look at my body as representing Brahman in his philosophy , he 'll take the entire world , he 'll take you and the worshippers and idols and everything else and he 'll place it inside the body of Brahman . So you have all the particularities of the world are now placed inside of Brahman . So we have only one essence and only one Brahman . Brahman 's all there is . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only reality , but the absolute is inclusive of particulars in all their infinite variety . So he affirms that Brahman is the only reality . But he also affirms that the absolute is inclusive , not exclusive . <p> See Sankara says it 's exclusive . The particularities are ultimately relegated to saguna which is illusory . It 's Maya . But he 's affirming the particulars in all their infinite variety . This is a much warmer , warmer kind of philosophy than we find in Sankara . <p> Therefore , Ramanuja rejects the nirguna/saguna distinction . Absolutely rejects nirguna/saguna distinction . He says that this is a false dichotomy which is so central to Advaitism . But he sees that the manifold qualities of Brahman are merrily inside of Brahman . All the attributes are united into one absolute . <p> In this phrase from the Upanishads : In the beginning there was one without a second . I mean , we looked at this particular phrase in the Upanishads as one of our Mahavakyas . OK , Sankara interprets this as a reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without a second " the second would be all the lower saguna realities that are there . So there 's only one reality " Brahman . Everything 's either identified with Brahman or called illusory or called Maya . OK , he takes the same phrase and interprets it very differently . For Ramanuja , he says : Yeah , this text is true . But rather than dismissing the particulars , all the attributes are united in one absolute . And so they are either in a unmanifested state or manifested state , but all this is occurring inside the body of Brahman . <p> So , Brahman is going to be identified with Isvara , not separated . Absolute Brahman is Isvara . Whereas Sankara would say that absolute Brahman is not Isvara . That 's saguna . Absolute Brahman is only nirguna . You can not speak of Brahman . Though it 's not consistently held in Ramanuja writings , but Sankara never refers to Brahman , to my knowledge offhand , as " he " . Only as " it " . Or as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but always impersonal terms . Ramanuja will refer to Brahman as " he " . And that 's a very important difference " whether god is " it " or a " he " . Ramanuja 's much more infusing personality into the ultimate supreme being in a way that is n't thinkable in the Sankara system . <p> So , once you abolish the nirguna/saguna distinction and then , of course , you have to ask : Well , what can we know about Brahman ? What can we say about Brahman ? He 's going to open the door for a lot more insight because he equates Isvara with Brahman . He argues that , rather than trying to put a tension between knowledge of god , no other knowledge or statements , as come kind of advedja , some kind of ignorance . Instead , it can actually be true knowledge because there is a subject and there is an object . For Sankara , there is only subject ; there is no object . And that is another nice way of summarising Sankara/Ramanuja . For Sankara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramanuja 's concerned with subject and object . What is the relationship between the ultimate to the worshipper ? What is the relationship between the eternal reality with the world ? That 's very , very important to Ramanuja . <p> For example , he says : A sentence in the Upanishads , for example , is a combination of words which denote something . Therefore words have meaning . If a child sees a cow , and a child says : There is a cow , it must be identified with some reality , some association , which is manifested as cow or dog or cat or whatever . What he would say is : There 's a cow . This cow reflects some kind of qualities " cow-ness , we might call it , I do n't know , it 's kind of a Platonic way of looking at it . But essentially he 's asking : What is the relationship between this idea of cow that Sankara says is all there is , Brahman , this kind of concept and basically Sankara wants to sever the tether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , you could say Brahman or the idea of god . But I 'm just trying to use a more practical example of this . He 's saying : How do you know what cow-ness is like except by looking at a cow ? So he 's trying to redirect the discussion to say that Sankara 's wrong by severing these two . We have to reunite the particulars with the universals , because the only way to understand the universal is to examine the particulars . And so the only way to know what god is like is by understanding the particulars of how god has manifested himself . <p> Where Sankara 's going to say all that 's illusory . All that is not going to give us any knowledge about god . I mean , Sankara 's only concerned with subject . Ramanuja 's concerned with subject and object " how are people who worship god , what can we learn about god from people who worship god . What 's the relationship between non-dualism and differentiation ? This is the kind of dilemma that Ramanuja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does Ramanuja then do more with the ideas of cosmical homologies ? <p> He 's much more positive with that because to me ... that 's right , cosmical homology is showing the relationship between the particular and the universal . And that 's classic ... I mean , I think we see it consistent with Upanishadic thought . So , yes , he will make a big deal of that . <p> In fact , part of what people who study both of these writers have argued is that Sankara tends to , when he interprets texts , he looks very narrowly at particular word and he interprets it according to kind of his theological grid . Ramanuja is much more looking at the overall context of the passage . And so he 's actually looking at a little broader scope about the Upanishads and what the Upanishad as a whole teaches in certain whole books . So he 's much more contextual thinker . And so he 's bringing in a lot more of the particulars than Sankara 's little more narrow approach . <p> What Ramanuja essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which define Brahman . The five defining attributes of Ramanuja 's writings are here before you . This is what he calls the divine what-ness , that is , the nature of god is known by this kind of what this ... this is what we call aseity . This is what we know about god in himself " the aseity of Brahman . <p> Just briefly , he accepts the conception of satya " or the fact that Brahman possesses unconditional being . That distinguishes him from all non-intelligent matter , which is subject to change and alteration . <p> He also affirms that Brahman is knowledge . This can be cit " he typically will actually focus more on the term jnana which is the term we 've already used for knowledge in our own knowledge or even consciousness . Enlightened souls are released from bondage of karma and rebirth can never know true knowledge because we have ... we 're bound up by our karma . True karma recognises the reality of god and we reckon our place in it . <p> He says that god can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from all limitations of place , time and so for particular substantial natures and so forth . He distinguishes between the " I " of the worshipper and the " thou " of the absolute . And so , even when he talks about tat twam asi , he says thou art that does not mean thou equals that . And he talks a lot about the relationship of what does it mean to talk about thou art that . In what way do we identify with Brahman . As we 'll see later , he argues that this identification is a relation identification , not an identification where we are lost in the absolute . Neti-neti for Ramanuja means there 's nothing more exalted than Brahma in nature or in attributes . So you can not compare god 's attributes to human attributes but it does not mean that god is without attributes . He has defined attributes . <p> He accepts the conception of ananda " bliss . This text in Brahmasutra where he says : Brahman is a being full of bliss . He accepts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahman as amalatva " purity . Also can mean stainlessness " without stain . <p> The main point of this is ... all of this involves serious , lengthy discussions in Ramanuja . But it basically , the idea is that we now have clearly defined attributes which he relates everything to in his writings . So this is a break-through from what we 've seen in Sankara . These are defining qualities , defining attributes . Sankara insists that the highest Brahman is nirguna " without qualities . Ramanuja says : No , we can identify defining qualities of Brahman . <p> Let me just actually give you some texts from Ramanuja to give you a feel for it . He says : Texts which speak of Brahman 's quote qualities do not point to a lower level , saguna . They point upward to Brahman 's defining qualities . So everything is related to these five qualities , but they 're not reduced to saguna . <p> ---- Break ---- <p> Now this is really important point here . Brahman can have contact with the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes . He 's going to say : " This is like clay being made into different kinds of pots and vessels and plates and everything else . The clay remains unchanged even though it takes on different shapes and forms . " So , he is going to open up the door for popular Bhaktism " popular Hindu worship and so forth . <p> Let me give you another quote of his . Again , you get a little feel for how Ramanuja writes . Again , you do n't need to know this quote . This is from his Sri Bhashya , his commentary I mentioned earlier . " Although ether this is a term they use for what we 'd say air , the outside air . Although air is separately contained in each one of a number of objects , such as jars and pots , they undergo increase and decrease because in those days they had clay pots and they got broken all the time or , you know , you could melt them down , heat them up , reshape them , whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's trying to really fend off Sankara here who says the minute you identify Brahman with particularities , then you have to associate Brahman with karmic imperfections " people 's sinfulness , people 's karmic indebtedness . So he 's saying : No , that 's not true . <p> " Just as the sun , although is seen reflecting a number of bodies of water ? ? ? equal size , is not touched by their increase and decrease . " You could have a great ocean of water or you could have a little puddle of water that reflects the sun , but that little puddle could completely evaporate . It would n't change the sun . The sun is merely being reflected in this . But we can learn about the sun by looking at this reflection in the water . Likewise , the supreme self , this is in reference to Brahman , though dwelling within various-shaped beings , some material like the earth and others intelligent like ourselves , remains untouched by their imperfections . So , he 's trying to demonstrate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dynamic relationship between the worshipper and Brahman . And that 's obviously very important . <p> Even in Sankara , I do n't think Sankara is free from this potential problem because he still has in the lesser ... When you have the world 's collapse and you have the world absorbed back into Brahman , if it is n't one of the great dissolutions , the karmic debtedness is still present latently in Brahman before it 's spewed out again . So even Sankara has to wrestle a little bit with this . But Ramanuja , even more so , trying to find ways to bring the presence of god into people 's lives . The minute you have god contacting the world , people get worried about well what ... in what way does this ... could this stain god . <p> This is the whole gnostic problem in the New Testament . If you really accept the incarnation , then you 're going to ... in actual embodiment of the eternal God , then that God is going to be stained by His contact with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christological heresies like any Docetic kind of Christology like Monophysitism , which wants to abolish the humanity of Christ . Monophysite " one nature " only divine nature . They 're trying to wrestle with this basic problem . Can God have true interaction with the world and remain untouched ? That 's exactly what Ramanuja is dealing with in these passages in the Sri Bhashya . <p> He 's so ... in terms of Brahman , he argues that Brahman is the efficient and material cause of the universe . Now , this is a little bit tricky because Sankara will say the same thing . But Sankara says : " Yeah , he 's the efficient and material , but the material is saguna . " But he 's actually saying : Brahman is the efficient and material cause of the universe " not with any qualifications . He uses the example of the egg metaphor : that inside an egg you have a ... and what they would say is a snake . It 's all curled up , you know , in very small form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the egg shell . In the same way , the world is unmanifested . It is all wrapped up tightly inside of Brahman . But eventually it breaks out and is manifested . But there 's no differentiation between the world 's material essence and the essence of Brahman . That 's a continuity that Sankara would not accept . So he actually , rather than going for two levels of Brahman " nirguna/saguna " Ramanuja accepts two modes of Brahman " karana Brahma karya Brahma is the way he uses it in the Sanskrit . It simply means the unmanifested Brahman , the manifested Brahman ; Brahman hidden , Brahman revealed . <p> He uses ? ? ? lump of a clay . The lump of clay can take on many forms . Take one lump of clay " we saw this in the Mahavakyas " you can shape it into vessels , cups , pots , whatever , but it does n't change the clayn-ness . The essence of the clay remains unchanged whether you make it into a pot or to a bowl or to a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the essence of it . So Brahman is untouched though he has been manifested in various forms and shapes . <p> Questions or comments about his view of Brahman " some of the differences ? Yes . <p> Question : ? ? ? argument that material cause ? ? ? <p> We can never forget that despite all of Ramanuja 's kind of relational development of theism , he is accepting the premise of Adviatism " and that is that there is only one essence in the universe . He 's simply saying that the clay pot is made of clay . So he 's acknowledging that karmic encrustations , lack of knowledge , lack of works and devotion are all part of this karmic encrustations that need be removed . But see , you have the same problem with Sankara as well because , in Sankara , he can say he 's monistic all he wants , but he still has to posit two realities . He has Brahman , you have Maya . So in a sense you have him set up two potential ... he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities he has to deal with . It 's the same thing with Ramanuja . Even though Ramanuja is trying to break down this , you still have to wrestle with questions about the origin of karma , because they keep claiming the karma comes from the last manifestation . But at some point you have to have an initial manifestation . So , what is the origin of evil ? What is the origin of karmic encrustations in the world ? <p> So , yeah , these are potential problems for Ramanuja . But he simply claims that his affirmation of the material consistency between Brahman and the world is not the same as equating Brahman with the karma that 's been encrusted in the world . So therefore you could say that Sankara has a problem with ... say , he has Brahma and Maya and Ramanuja still has Brahman and karma . You could say that . That would be a potential ... I mean Madhva eventually exploits all this . If we had time , we could develop Madhva . <p> Let 's see now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own sayings on this Maya . Ramanuja rejects the notion that the world is an illusory perception . I do n't even think that Sankara fully supports that but certainly Sankara 's followers , some of them , did . And Ramanuja definitely rejects the notion that the world is illusory perception . All knowledge is genuine knowledge , even though mistakes occur in the act of cognisance . So he 's trying to reassert the power of knowledge . Both mistaken identity and empirically valid perception are related to the objectively real and as such could be called valid perceptions . This is going to really develop a lot the idea of the snake/rope . Now you remember the snake/rope analogy . What ... how did Sankara use snake/rope ? What was his application of that in general ? <p> Response : ? ? ? reality ? ? ? perceived may not necessarily be valid . <p> OK , right . So he 's trying to create a tension point between the reality that 's perceived and the actual reality that 's there . And so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from what you may perceive . Ramanuja is not going to accept this interpretation of rope/snake because he says : " Wait a minute . How does the person think that it 's a snake ? On what basis does a person believe that a coil of rope in a darkened tent is a snake ? How does he know it looks like a snake ? " <p> Response : ? ? ? <p> He 's seen snakes before ? <p> Response : ? ? ? <p> And it has the qualities and attributes of a snake . So there must be some relational ... some connection between the attributes of a rope and the attributes of a snake . OK , he was wrong when he thought it was a snake , but does that mean that the snakes do not exist because there happens to be a rope sitting there ? Gee , it could have been a rope . I mean , it could have been a snake . So he begins to raise questions about this . And he says the fact that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sankara here " the fact that it 's only a rope does not invalidate the reality of the snake . So you find Ramanuja is just challenging the whole Sankarite world , saying that you can not dismiss human knowledge and the reliability of human knowledge . <p> I developed this point a lot in my book on this whole conception of propositional truth statements . Because once you can not accept propositional truth statements , then the whole argumentation foundation breaks down . How can Sankara make his arguments ? How are we sure that his arguments are not illusory ? OK , so he makes the same point . This is Ramanuja . If Sankara is correct , then all perceptions are unreliable , both snake and rope . That 's my edition . And there can be no basis for the claim that scriptural statements are authoritative either . That 's Ramanuja . <p> So what he is saying is that , if Sankara is true , then we ca n't trust ... You walk into this tent at night . You look down and you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a rope . Well how do you know it 's not a rope ? How do you know it 's not just a curl of electrical wire ? How do you know it 's even a rope ? Maybe you 're still being deceived . You thought it was a snake , but it 's a rope . But it 's actually not a rope , it 's an electrical wire . It 's not an electrical wire , it 's actually some sticks , twined up sticks , or whatever . I mean , there 's no end to it . " How can you trust anything ? " Ramanuja says . He says : " Sankara is putting a doubt at the very root of our ability to have discourse . And therefore , how can you speak authoritatively about scriptural statements ? How can we be accurate about his knowledge of the Upanishads ? Maybe the Upanishads are illusory . " I mean , he 's really banging away here at Sankara 's worldview . Yes . <p> Question : How in the end would ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept Maya as illusory . He accepts Maya as simply the inability to recognise our dependence on Brahman . That 's how he defined Maya . Maya is our inability to see our connection to Brahman , but is not the realisation that we have no reality other than our Atman . He does not accept that . <p> I mean , I can see Buddhism ? ? ? Sankara would be very upset if he heard you say that , because he would say that you 're trying to make him into a Buddhist . He 's not trying to say all of this , all that matters is my perception . He is trying to desperately argue for the reality of Brahman as the only reality " a great subject out there . So he has a reference point " and this is CS Lewis ' point " he has a reference point to a reality that is not like the Buddhist . You ? ? ? right Joy , that some of the language can sound like he does n't take seriously the world . And therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're next you 've slipped into postmodernism . But I think the foundation is profoundly different . You 'll find much more support in the Buddhist camp than the Hindu camp , in my view , for postmodernism . <p> I ca n't wait . I wish I had ... we had time to show you some of the statements from Sankara but , I mean , in the Buddhism class we 'll definitely look at this , but he really attacks the Buddhist . If you want to get a Sankarite mad , call him a Buddhist . <p> OK , ignorance for Ramauja ... this is ... this will be the same for his view of Maya . So this will help you Geoffrey . For Maya is our inability to perceive that all of the manifold forms of existence are utterly dependent upon Brahman . So he is actually going to create a possibility for devotion . <p> Now , let me just give you a little story about Ramanuja . Ramanuja goes through the whole ashram system as a young man . I did n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both these men , have dramatic ... ? ? ? there 's a lot of cultural tensions here . Sankara 's from Kerala . He 's from south-west India . Ramanuja is from Madras " the other side of south India . To this day , there 's a tremendous tension between the Tamils and the Malayalis . They all think they have the true India . There 's a lot of ... within India a lot of tension between Tamils and Malayalis . So the fact that Sankara 's a Malayali and Ramanuja 's a Tamil reveals a lot of just the whole insight into the way Indian culture has developed . So you have , you know , Plato on one side of India , Aristotle on the other . And there always in tension with each other . <p> So one of the things that Ramanuja does is that he , like Sankara , goes through the whole standard system . Everybody has to go through the standard system of becoming a ... recognised as a philosopher . They all write commentaries on the Upanishads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go through that very , very carefully . So they 're going through the guru system . So they 're being taught by gurus that teach them the mantras , the secret mantras . So , once you get into that system , as you get closer and closer to the teacher , you begin to be given more and more secret mantras that only people can know at certain levels of knowledge . <p> So Ramanuja goes through the same system . Well , finally , after years of study and years of memorising the Upanishads and all this , all the mantras , well he finally gets to the point where he is going to be brought into the presence of his main discipler " who is going whisper in his ear in a closed chamber the most sacred mantra of the whole ... that part of south India . Only probably three people , two or three people , in the entire world know this mantra . And Ramanuja is going to hear it . This is like big day . This is like you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diploma . They whisper you this mantra . So he goes into the chamber and they whisper this mantra to Ramanuja . OK , he now knows the mantra " the sacred mantra . <p> He goes out onto the balcony " all these crowds there to celebrate his being invested with this new , you know ... And what does he do ? He shouts the mantra down to the whole crowd . OK , this is not making the people happy . This is a very radical thing to do . There are lot of disputes about whether this happened or not , historically . But the followers of Ramanuja say that it happened . And it very well indeed could have happened . Ramanuja was demonstrating , at least symbolically here , that I believe philosophy should be for the people , not for a select group of Brahmans . So his philosophical thrust is finding ways to empower the masses of India with true religious experience . Sankara is about denying everybody 's experience . Ramanuja 's about empowering everyone 's experience . <p> So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , he 's trying to create a metaphor for how Brahman relates to the average worshipper or to the world of worshippers . And he uses the body/soul analogy : we are the body , Brahman is the soul . He is that what animates , invigorates , the entire body just as ... This is a Middle Ages kind of analogy . Brahman ensouls the world by constituting the soul of the world . And all entities constitute the body of Brahman . He is not really using the word body here in the way that we would use the world body . This is the kind of classical use of the word body . You know , an apple has a body . Everything has a body . That which is ensouled is a body in Ramanuja 's thinking . <p> So , what he does is that he develops a whole series of what he calls the defining relationships . And I 'll just briefly mention these . You do not need to know these terms , but if you 're going to do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're now getting to the heart of Ramanuja 's whole thought . Everything he teaches about god in the world revolves around this so-called body/soul analogy . The whole idea behind this is to demonstrate that the world is in all of us , are in an inextricable union , dependent relationship , with Brahman . <p> And so he develops three defining relationships . The first is what he calls adhara/adheya which is support and the thing supported . Brahman is the support . We are the things supported . He uses several analogies to make this clear . Let me give you some of these analogies . That would be helpful . He gives the example of , for example , a ring in a person 's ear . The person who bears the ring is the ring-bearer . The ring is there by virtue of the ring-bearer . The ring has no meaning apart from the ring-bearer . And therefore the ring is dependent upon the ring-bearer for its existence . It can not exist apart from . It is not intelligible apart from . The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which that sound is related . He talks about the staff-bearer and a staff " the person who carries the staff . What is the meaning of a staff unless it is there for the staff-bearer . So this whole thing of support and things supported is developed extensively in Ramanuja . This is , by the way , all these three relationships are there in your handouts . <p> The second is the niyantr/niyamya " the controller and thing controlled . Brahman controls the world . We are that which is controlled . Everything in the world is controlled by something . He uses the example of the charioteer driving the chariot . God is the charioteer . He drives the chariot . We are the chariot . But there 's this relationship . That 's what 's so powerful here . He 's trying to say : " OK . The chariot is not capable of being understood apart from the charioteer that drives it . And yet , they 're related to each other . There 's dependency upon the chariot to the charioteer . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings , yet is within all beings , whom no beings know , whose body is all beings , who controls all beings from within . He is your self , the inner controller , antaryamin . Remember that word antaryamin we looked at ? The immortal . This is him saying that , at the microcosmic level , the inner life of the individual is animated by Brahman and has no existence apart from Brahman . He is the inner controller . So that draws on all of those Upanishadic texts related to antaryamin . <p> And finally , sesin/sesa " principal entities , subordinate entity . There is that which is the principal and that which is the subordinate entity . On the microcosmic level , the material body is in subordinate to the inner life of the spiritual body . Your spirit is the principal . The Atman is principal . The material body is subordinate . But the relationship is linked . The purpose of the physical body is to give honour to the spiritual entity . Likewise the entire material world exists to give honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is obviously standard cosmical homology . He 's simply saying that the relationship is there . The link is there . It 's very , very important . <p> What you should know about this is that essentially Ramanuja develops a series of relational terms to bring out the essential nature that the worshipper is in relationship with god . And it 's a dependent relationship . As we 'll see later , it is a bhakti " it is a relationship of devotional dependence upon god . That is the nature of true knowledge for Ramanuja . To use his own expression here about salvation : The soul or self " and in this case he 's using the soul here in a different way than we saw earlier ; this is the self of the Atman " it is a mode of god distinct , but always in an inalienable relationship like the body is to the soul . One 's individual reality is not swallowed up by and in that of Brahman . <p> So he 's not going to accept the destruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your consciousness being lost in Brahman . There is a relationship " an I/thou relationship " between Brahman and the worshipper . It is simply the I/thou is not other than Brahman . It 's a relationship within the body of Brahman . So he has relationships within Brahman that will be eternal . And this flows right out of another school of thought . We have n't had a chance to develop this , but in the Samkhya philosophy , number 1 on this list , they also believe in these two eternal things : purusha , prakriti . And Ramanuja is accepting a lot of the thinking behind that " that we have eternal relationships . We 're not lost in Brahman . <p> So , to give a ... again some quote from Ramanuja here . And this again , get the gist of this " what he 's saying here . To maintain that the consciousness of the " I " " they 're always preoccupied with this " I " thing " does not persist in the state of final release is again altogether inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I " here he 's referring to what Sankara would call the Jivatman " the individual Atman . That is lost in Brahman according to Sankara . OK , he says this is inappropriate . It in fact amounts to the doctrine only expressed in someone different words , Buddhism , that final release is the annihilation of the self . So this is Ramanuja 's way of politely saying " he 's very rarely polite " but here he 's being a little polite because he knows how sensitive this is . Sankara is nothing but a closet Buddhist . <p> OK , the " I " is not a mere attribute of the self , so that even after its destruction the essential nature of the self it might persist . It constitutes the very nature of the self . So he 's saying the " I " , when you say " I " in worshipping god , that " I " is not something that you , you know , some perceiver that 's buried down there and will be lost someday . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in moksa , you can say : " I worship Brahman . " Sankara would never say that . There 's no worshipping Brahman once you ... You are simply Brahman . You 're lost in Brahman . Here you have I/thou worshipping context even in the state of moksa . It 's the very nature of the self . So he is basically saying if you do n't have this , then all you have is Buddhism . <p> For Sankara , jnana , knowledge , is the apex to which karma and bhakti can only point . That 's a quote from Arahdlot For Ramanuja , bhakti is the apex to which jnana and karma can only lead . If you go back to this whole thing here , this is Sankara 's Adviatism . We have seen this throughout the course . Devotion and works are in a subsidiary role " merely helpful only if they lead to true knowledge . And then once you climb that ladder , the ladder kicked away , because you 've made it to the higher knowledge . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept this . Now , are you ready for my graphic here ? I hope this works . I am going to show you before your very eyes what Ramanuja does to this little scheme here . Are you ready ? There we go . Now , we have Ramanuja 's modified non-dualism looks like this . He is going to argue that all of your knowledge and works must lead to devotion . This is why he 's the popular philosopher of India . We 're now seeing that this big wall here is not as firm as we thought " because he 's going to provide the philosophical support for all this . Because he 's saying : " OK , all the Bhaktism is creating this sense of dependency upon god . That 's a good thing . That 's a great thing . <p> We 'll have to examine more , as we 're almost through this . We have a little more to go . But I want to stop there " or take a little pause " and see if we are clear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like five minutes to go . Yeah . <p> Question : It seems like Ramanuja , if he did n't have the presupposition of non-dualism , he would have been a Christian in the way that he 's thinking of god as eternal and we are absolutely dependent on Him . If he did n't have the similar ontology of our being the same essence , I think that he would come to the fact that we need some sort ... that where does the essence of the clay touch the part , touch the karma , and not be tainted by it . I mean , that 's the only missing link it seems to me . Where am I missing ... ? <p> No . There 's no question this is a warm ? ? ? I want to show you a quote here . If we have time , we 'll come back to this little thing here . But this is Max M++ller , quoting very similar to what you just said . Max M++ller 's a very famous scholar who studied Hinduism his whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes this great quote here : " It must be admitted that in India , instead of one Vedanta philosophy , we have two , springing from the same root , but extending its branches in two very different directions , that of Sankara being kept for the unflinching reasoners who , supported by an unwavering faith in monism , do not shrink back from any of its consequences but then " look what he goes on to say , which is the point you just made " another , that of Ramanuja , trying hard to reconcile their monism with the demands of the human heart that required and always will require a personal god as the last cause of all that is and an eternal soul that yearns for an approach to or a reunion with that being . None other than Max M++ller made that point . I think it summarises what you just said . <p> There 's no question Ramanuja is opening the door for a much more powerful potential discourse about god in the Indian context without being relegated everything to saguna . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things , some of the worst challenges to Christianity are heresies of Christianity . You know , Islam is a big challenge to Christianity , not because it 's so bizarre , but because it 's so close . You have Christianity , you have so much of our doctrines , but you take Christ out and so you end up with nothing . So , in the same way , Ramanuja is not prepared to accept the ontological distinction between creation and Creator . It 's simply not present . He 's a monist . After all is said and done , he 's saying : " I do n't distinguish between myself ultimately and god . " Be careful not to hear this as too Christian . But you 're right . It 's wrong at the ontological level . The linguistic level , it sounds very positive . <p> OK any other comments or questions about this ? Yes . <p> Question : He 's a monist , but he says ... Would he agree with what Max M++ller says about him that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united with this god but the " I " is still separate ? <p> Yes , he would agree with that statement . Not the " I " is separate . The " I " is in a devotional separation , but not an ontological separation . But yeah , he would agree with that . <p> break in tape ? <p> That is part of the terms you are to know . So make sure that we are well aware of this . And this has actually been something that 's divided Bhakti followers of Vishnu in south India . I may have told you about the Taragali and Varagali , the people who are known only by a half a inch of paint . Did I mention that to you ? Well , this is that . We 're finally there . Because the only way to tell the difference between the ... those who follow parabhakti and prapatti is how long the line coming down their forehead goes . This actually refers to a dispute that broke out among followers of Ramanuja about how much did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw last time , one of the features of Ramanuja is the popularisation of the way of knowledge in the sense that it invades the Bhakti movement and begins to find philosophical foundation in the Bhakti system . <p> The question arose whether Ramanuja was seeking to expand Bhakti to include all the followers , but yet still provide special favour for those that were in the way of knowledge . So , the way this eventually developed was a schism within Ramanujan thought about whether he taught parabhakti or prapatti and for whom . The basic distinction which we 've already discussed with the monkey/kitten analogy is whether or not ... What is your role in being saved ? Essentially this is a discussion about faith versus works . The act of devotion , which is the monkey analogy , would recall that the baby monkey has to cling to the mother by his or her own power and strength , even though the mother monkey carries her around . Whereas a kitten , as you know , is carried by the scruff of the neck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way , they argue that the parabhakti is for those who have true knowledge about the way of bhakti in ways they can actively pursue their moksa which would include everything from study of the Vedas to following a guru , all across the whole chart that we 've been looking at . So it would be forms of active devotion work for gurus would teach : " If you follow this particular path , then you will achieve moksa . " That 's parabhakti . Whereas the prapatti is a movement which says that even the lowest devotee , who may not realise their role , or their need for their role , if by simply trusting in , for example , Krishna , they will be saved without any works involved at all . So this would be the triumph of devotionalism over works . <p> If you go back to our chart which we looked at last time , this incredible tension that goes throughout Hindu philosophy about the place of devotion , works and knowledge . This would be a view that devotion does actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much somebody knows what they 're doing or precise works . If their heart is devoted to god , then they will be saved . So that distinction we had not had time to actually discuss . <p> So , typically , as a rule , the Tengali tradition , the southern tradition , or the tradition that the follows Tengali , which would emphasise the grace of god would be more likely found in south India ; the Veragali in north India . All this discussion is about based on his interpretation of the Bhagavad-Gita , the text that we looked at in one of our Mahavakyas : " Abandon all duties , all dharmas and just surrender to me . I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction . " That 's Gita 18.66 . That particular passage is the passage by which all of this discussion is mostly centred around . <p> Question : It seems that he focuses on one of these or is it both of them or ... ? <p> That 's what the dispute is over . Ramanuja 's writings are actually ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point and so some are saying that the kind of bhakti that Ramanuja was actually promoting was parabhakti which would involve a particular path or multiple pathways to god . Whereas the prapatti would simply say : " As long as you 're devoted to Krishna or some other particular deity , then the actual instrumentality of that by god is not part of your business essentially . " He 's simply ... your job is to trust . In fact , abandon all works . They would interpret this dharma as abandoning works and simply trusting . <p> It 's essentially a bit of the argument that we have in our own tradition regarding the role of faith versus works . To rely upon works is , in a sense , they would argue a form of abandoning bhakti . Because true Bhaktism would involve total surrender . Whereas if somebody 's following a particular works path , it might imply that they are trying to earn their salvation . So this is essentially ... I mean , the argumentation you would find very familiar in terms of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformed versions of soteriology in the Christian tradition .

@@35723298 @4723298/ <h> Catholicism and British Protestantism in the 16th Century <p> Where were we last time ? I finally got round , through all this sex and scandal , and so on , to the actual reformation . We were talking about the introduction of the English language in the worship of the church , and the changes which that brought about . Now the essential thing that you need to remember about the English reformation , what makes it different from the reformation in every other country is that it was from the top down . It was imposed by the government . This determines its nature and also the kind of fall-out that there was afterwards . On the one hand , we can say with more or less complete certainty that if the reformation had not been imposed from the top down , it either would not have happened at all , or it would have taken a very lot longer to take place . We know this because in England , unlike France , unlike Germany , there was no large group of people who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reform that Luther promoted . As I pointed out during this course , you can of course find odd people here and there who supported Luther , yes , a few people who read Protestant literature , yes , but large numbers of people who were agitating for reform , no . This there was not . When the reformation came , one of the problems was finding supporters , people who would not just go along with what they were told to do , but would actually , positively , take that line , who knew enough about what was going on to support it whole heartedly . That was one thing . <h> Popular Protestantism <p> The other side to this , of course , is that once the door was opened to reformation , it did n't take long for what you might call the genuine reformation . That is to say , people who really wanted what we call Protestantism , the grass roots desire for spiritual change , this kind of thing . It did n't take long for that to enter in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the door was opened , gradually popular Protestantism became a real phenomenon . By the time you get to 1549 , you are getting ordinary people who are genuinely converted to the new way of thinking . And as their numbers grow , this took several generations , but as Protestantism as a belief implanted itself in the population , then there was agitation for further reformation , for further change . <h> Conflict over when to stop reforming <p> And of course at this point the government dug its heels in . They were n't going to have any further change . And they justified this position very largely by saying something like , well , we 've already changed , and we 've changed quite far enough , thank-you very much , and we do n't need to change anymore , and you people who want further change , are really just trouble makers who are n't satisfied with what you 've been given already . And so the later history of the English reformation is really a history between the radicals , if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are what you call them . If you do n't like them , you call them hot-prots or something like that . If you like them you call them things like consistent , people who wanted a full and complete reformation verses supporters of the establishment who were not against reformation , but they thought things had gone far enough and it was time to stop . This always makes a very difficult situation because both sides feel that they are in the right . Both sides feel that they are being attacked unfairly by the other . The radicals attacking the moderates because the moderates do n't really believe what they say they are supposed to believe . And the moderates feeling very upset , because yes they do and they just do n't think things should go to extremes . It 's a very difficult situation . <h> Puritanism <p> But this is the situation out of which Puritanism arose . Puritanism is the name which we generally give today to the radical wing of the English reformation in its early stages . Puritanism , I hasten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all know one when we see one . We all have a sort of picture , like the man on the Quaker Oats , what you king of imagine a puritan was like . But it 's very hard to pin down precisely who they were . Once you start trying to define them , it becomes very difficult . However , a puritan tendency , a tendency for a more pure form of reformation manifests itself for the first time after the publication of the 1549 prayer book . That is to say the first English language prayer book and the change to the liturgy from Latin to English . Why ? What happened at this point ? <h> Cranmer 's changes <p> The archbishop , Thomas Cranmer , who introduced these changes believed that he was introducing Lutheran teaching on justification by faith , but he was doing it in a subtle manner by leaving in tact most of the outward form of worship . So , if you went to church , apart from the change of the language , you would n't necessarily notice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as Cranmer was concerned , this was deliberate . He was very sensitive to the fact that most people care more about things like which hymn book we use , where we place the flowers , who sits where , what they 're wearing , etc , than what they do about things like theology . He was aware enough of the ordinary person and their point of view to know this . And he wanted the new theological teaching to be introduced wit a minimum of disruption , so that it would not be thrown out by people who were fed up because they changed the hymn book . You can always split the church over something like that , and the point gets totally lost , if anybody was ever concerned about it to begin with . So he understood that . <h> Conservative element accepted <p> However , something happened which he did n't expect . And that is that the conservative element in the church , those who did not want a change of theology , those who thought Luther was anathema , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , we 'll get along without the pope , we do n't need a pope , but we do n't want to change our theology we want to have transubstantiation , we want to have all the Catholic theology , just not the pope . These people looked at the new services of worship and said there is nothing here that goes against our beliefs . We can accommodate our beliefs to these new ways of doing things . <h> Protestants want more reform <p> And this alarmed those of protestant sympathies around the archbishop , because they said these Catholic minded people can carry on in the way that they have always done , then the message is not getting across . The archbishop may think that he has put justification by faith alone into this worship service , but that is not what is being read or heard by these people who do n't want to hear it . These people should be upset by the change in worship and they are not . So , this clearly means things have not gone far enough . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prayer Book <p> It just so happened that at this very moment , people began to arrive from continental Europe who were authentic bearers of the reformation message . This again has to be remembered because up until this point hardly anybody in England had ever met a reformer , had ever had any close contact with one of the reformers from the continent . It is true that William Tyndale had gone to be a student in Wittenberg . So he at least knew who Luther was . But Tyndale never went back to England . He was an outlaw , so he does n't really count as far as that goes . Then there was Robert Barnes , whom I mentioned , but he also was a student in Wittenberg and he did go back to England . So you might make an exception of him . He had actually had direct contact with Luther . But apart from that , their knowledge of the reformation was from books , and from intermediaries , people who communicated through second , third , and fourth hand . But from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in England , the most prominent being Martin Bucer . And Bucer who was a teacher of Calvin was a very major catch indeed . He arrived in England just about the time that Cranmer 's prayer book was being produced , and he went to Cambridge where he became a professor of divinity , that is to say theology in Cambridge . Bucer took one look at Cranmer 's attempts at producing a reformed style of worship , and said this is n't good enough . There 's a 101 ways in which you can improve this , and he drew up a list of things that ought to be changed . Another person who came along at the same time , another continental reformer , again , very much along with Bucer in those circles , a man called Peter Martyr Vermigli who was an Italian but he accompanied Bucer to England . He became professor of theology at the University of Oxford , and he came up with more or less the same kind of conclusions as Bucer did about the liturgy . They said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it genuinely protestant . Cranmer at this point was convinced that further reformation was necessary . And so very shortly after the prayer book of 1549 was produced , he sat down to revise it . It took him a couple years to try to do that . So he was revising it in a more protestant direction . <h> John Hooper " Cranmer differ on tactics <p> However , before that happened , one of his nominees for the bishopric of Roster , a man by the name of John Hooper , was appointed and nominated as bishop . But he refused to wear the robes which he was expected to wear as a bishop , because he argued that these were relics of popery . The point was the English church had not altered anything of the declaration or what the priests wore from what had gone on in the Middle Ages . Now , there was and to some extent still is a major controversy over this , because what is it that a Catholic priest wears in the service . If you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you say to yourself , what is he wearing and what does it mean . Well , the truth is that what the average Catholic priest wears is really handed down over many centuries from the kind of clothing that prominent people wore in the late Roman Empire . A bishop , for example , will be dressed in purple always , because purple was the color of the emperor . In the Roman Empire , only the emperor wore purple . But a bishop was emperor in his church . So , the wearing of the purple was a sign of his authority . And today you see a Catholic bishop or an Episcopalian bishop I do n't know about Methodists but the others , they wear purple as a sign of this Episcopal authority . The other things that they wear are basically elements of clothing which were reasonably common in late Roman times . Of course , by the 16th century , they were incredibly out of date . Unfortunately , the medieval church had developed alternative explanations for the clothing . They forgot , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Romans dressed in the early centuries , and began to devise all kinds of theological reasons for wearing these vestments as they are called . The clerical vestments came to be associated with the theology of transubstantiation . So that a priest dressed in a certain way was dressed for sacrifice in order to perform what is called the Eucharistic sacrifice . And when you saw someone wandering around in that kind of clothing , you knew what was coming . This was part of the performance . As I told you the other day a very important part of the England church worship is the acting . I know this sounds terribly unbelieving , but it 's actually true . If you lead worship you realize it 's true . This is n't a blasphemous thing to say , it 's simply making things flow more smoothly . <p> I was in church on Sunday morning and I just about threw the hymn book at the woman who was leading it . Not because she was a woman , I hasten to add , but she did exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed in the church , they had n't paid their bill or something . It 's a Presbyterian church so you can imagine counting every penny . It 'll be worse next week because they have n't gotten to the end of the month yet . But anyhow the light had gone . She 's a lovely person , but really she needs her head read . She had decided she was going to have us all read psalm 100 , but of course nobody could see anything , it was too dark . So she said that . She said I was planning to do this this morning but it 's too dark . But let 's do it anyway . So , of course you are fumbling around in the dark to find the bible in the pew . She said , I realize there are three or four different translations of the bible in the pews so you all have a different version . So not only could you not read it . Of course you can all say it memory ca n't you ? Ha ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering of Psalm 100 . I was sitting there myself the whole time thinking this is the very thing you do n't do . If the situation requires flexibility , be flexible . Read it yourself dear , you are not coming to my church to carry on like this . She had n't learned lesson number one which is to adapt to the circumstances . It was n't her fault that the lighting was n't working . This is my point ; you have to know how to adapt . <p> But anyway , the Eucharistic vestment as they were understood by the time of the reformation in this way . And Hooper , his argument was I am not a Mass priest . I am not here to perform Eucharistic sacrifice . That is not what God has called me to do , or what I am ordained to do . I am rather a preacher of the word . And he raised a very important issue , which is ; what is the ordained ministry for ? And Protestantism as a movement shifted the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained minister is no longer there primarily to perform various sacramental acts , but is there primarily to be a preacher of the word . And this implied , you were not able to preach the word unless you were educated . So to be a preacher required having university training . The reformers began to insist that only university graduates could be ordained . And therefore Hooper argues it is more appropriate given the nature of the ministry which we are performing that we should wear clothing which indicates our academic status , not clothing which indicates that we are going to perform some kind of sacrifice . In other words , the clothing we wear tells people what sort of thing we are there to do . And if we wear academic dress , black gowns , and this kind of thing , if we dress as academics , then people will expect an academic kind of ministry . In other words they will expect a preaching and teaching ministry primarily . His argument was change the clothing to suit the change in function . <p> Now Cranmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hooper ; of course I agree with everything you say as far as the nature of the ministry is concerned , but if you do what you intend to do , you are only going to upset people . It 's all very well for you to play around like this . You know what you are doing , but nobody else does . It 's better to let these things just develop according to their own momentum . Do n't rush it . I would rather you go there and preach the gospel dressed like a medieval priest , never mind that , do the preaching and teaching and so on , then when people are converted and they understand your motives for change , then change . We 'll let that happen a bit later . Let 's get our priorities right . Well , how do you choose between these two people ? It 's quite clear that they are heading in the same direction in one sense . Their basic outlook , their basic intentions are identical . They differ on tactics . Strategy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure that is where Cranmer was heading . Sometimes when people give an explanation like Cranmer , what they really mean is never . <p> Yes , that 's now . No , I think Cranmer was sincere . He did want change , but he was a gradualist . The fact is he was changing the liturgy ; he was always thinking it through and changing it a little bit more . He was n't a revolutionary type . He wanted to do it slowly and gradually , and he imagined at this point that he would have several years of experimentation and practicing , and just doing things in a step-by-step way . He did n't know that he did n't have a very long time ahead of him . No , I think he was sincere on the whole . But , he was trying to restrain those who wanted to go too fast . He felt that they were going to rock the boat and just upset everything . <h> John Knox <p> In the end , Hooper had to be forced to conform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much against his will . And , in the process of the argument , managed to attract to himself certain people who were going to carry the flame into the next generation of whom the most notable was John Knox . Now , you say to yourself , what is John Knox doing in this particular story . But , John Knox had turned up in England at this point , uninvited . Knox had been one of the very small band of people in Scotland , who had been affected by reformation ideas . <p> Scotland as an independent country at this time did not undergo any of the upheaval of Henry the 8th . They did n't have Henry the 8th in Scotland . They maintained on the whole , a fairly conservative Catholic church . And the number of people who were in any way affected by the reformation was really very small . <p> However , the situation was complicated by the fact that Scotland never seemed to be able to keep a king for very long . They went through several generations of kings dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who did n't rule until they grew up . And this happened in the 16th century . James the 4th , who had married Margaret the daughter of Henry the 7th of England , was defeated in battle with the English and died shortly after in 1513 , leaving behind an infant son who was James the 5th . But no sooner than James the 5th grew up and started fighting , then he fought the English as well , and was killed in battle in 1542 . He left his baby daughter Mary , who was only about six months old at that time , as the heir to the Scottish throne . This situation led to weak government . <p> And Henry decided , after he killed James the 5th in battle , he decided to put an end to the Scottish problem once and for all by proposing marriage between his son Edward , who was at this time about 5 or 6 years old , and Mary . He figured that if Mary who was heiress to the Scottish throne and his son Edward got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be the end of the Scottish problem . In other words , Scotland would n't be there as an independent country to attack the English from behind . Well , this idea was half accepted in Scotland . About half the Scottish nobility said alright , we 'll do this , because they were a bit fed up about having yet another child ruling over them , and the idea of having a girl was much worse in their eyes , so they took this as the best deal they could get . The other half of the Scottish nobility said under no circumstances is any Englishman ever coming anywhere near here . We would rather die than have this . Now , James the 5th had in fact married a French princess . And so the anti-English faction in Scotland decided that the only way they could get out from under Henry the 8th Henry threatened invasion of the country if he did n't get his way . And so the Scottish parliament , fearing the worst , agreed . But the opposition waited for its chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another direction , and we will just see . <p> And as soon as Henry was dead in 1547 they seized the moment , because Edward was still only 9 years old . They broke off the engagement between Edward and Mary . They called on a French Army to invade Scotland , to liberate 5 year old Mary and her mother , from a difficult situation . In 1547 , A French Army landed in Scotland , backed Mary and her mother , and the Scottish party which rebelled , the pro-English group in Scotland , which included anybody who was in favor of any sort of reformation of the church , these people were defeated . <p> Now , among those defeated was John Knox . As someone interested in reformation , he was one of the Pro-English parties . And one of the ironies was Mary the queen was taken off to France at the age of 5 in order to be brought up in the French court and John Knox as taken in the same fleet as a galley slave . This of course endeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . This was not the best way to begin . Anyway , Knox eventually escaped , made his way to England , where he was a kind of hero , as a defender of Protestantism . I do n't know how much of it was his personality and how much of it was his experiences which had radicalized him , but in the Hooper controversy , he took the side of Hooper . He was one of the extremists . Because he was an articulate person , he was a very impressive speaker , a very powerful personality and imposed himself on everybody ; he got his way , he was feared , generally a charismatic figure . So he went a long way in England , had a lot of influence at this particular time . Therefore , around him there gathered the more radical types of people who wanted a more consistent , more thorough going kind of reformation . <p> Well , in 1552 , the revised prayer book appeared . This was much more protestant in tone . Now , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes the ministers were expected to wear were greatly simplified , if not as much as Knox would have wished , and various other changes were made . So , nobody could be in any doubt whatsoever that now they were worshipping in a protestant church . The kinds of things the Catholics felt they could live with were taken out almost systematically . It was deliberately done so nobody could claim that there was anything Catholic left in this new form of worship . That was introduced on All Saints Day , November 1 , 1552 . <h> Lady Jane Grey <p> But , it did n't have a very long life , because , the following year , on the 6th of July , the king died . He 'd never been very well . He was a sickly child . He died of tuberculosis when he was only 16 years old . Now , this opened a can of worms . The regency council which was governing the country in his name , did not want Edward 's sister , Mary , who was next in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Mary was the daughter of Catherine of Aragon , Mary was Catholic . So they put up their own candidate for the throne who was a protestant cousin , Lady Jane Grey . Lady Jane Grey was actually proclaimed queen and she ruled for 9 days . This has never been accepted as official . Her so called reign does not exist in any official records . But she was theoretically in charge of the government for 9 days . <h> Mary Tudor <p> But loyalty to the family of Henry the 8th , loyalty to the wishes of the King , who had said he wanted his daughter to succeed , this was strong enough in the Country , and resentment of the regency council from the other members of the nobility was also strong enough , that Mary was able to make good her claim . On the 19th of July in 1553 , she entered London as queen , thirteen days after the death of her brother . This of course created an extremely difficult situation . Because , not only was Mary Catholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something about the people who had ruled in her brother 's reign and who had tried to prevent her from succeeding . She could n't very well just let them go free . So , she arrested them , put them on trial , and had them beheaded , more or less immediately . <p> Cranmer 's position as archbishop was extremely difficult . Cranmer did not want to support Lady Jane Grey . He was a legitimist in this sense . He was not particularly friendly to the leading people in the Regency Council who were pressing Lady Jane 's claims . In fact , he was extremely unfriendly to them . So , he was n't really a supporter of Lady Jane . But , of course , neither did he want Mary on the throne , because Mary was going to undo everything which he had done , everything which he had tried to do . <p> What is worse , from Mary 's point of view , is that Mary had a deep seated dislike of Cranmer , because Cranmer was the one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her illegitimate . And you have to look at the time scale . Mary was born in 1516 . Cranmer approved the annulment in 1533 when Mary was 17 . Now , we are talking about 1553 . Mary is 37 . Her life was undoubtedly a very tragic one . Just at the moment when she would normally have been expected to have been married off to some reasonably important person , because she was the daughter of the King of England , she was in fact shut away as a liability , because she was the daughter of a marriage which Henry did not want to recognize . She was however old enough and this was the problem , because she was 17 , so she was old enough to be fully aware of what was going on and to take mother 's side . She felt her mother had been fairly badly treated , which of course was true . However , Mary determined in her heart that if she ever got the opportunity , she was going to avenge what had been done to her mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not very wise , because twenty years later , the world had changed . She was just as determined to get her pound of flesh , as she had been on the day when her mother was put away . As I say , it 's very understandable , but it 's not politically a very wise thing to do . Politically she should have said , that 's happened , it 's finished now , mother is long dead , you ca n't do anything about it , maybe issue a proclamation saying it was all wrong and then leaving it at that . But Mary was not that type . She was very determined , and she was going to press on with what she wanted to do . And of course , Cranmer was enemy number one . Daddy was dead ; she could n't really do much about him . But Cranmer was an acceptable substitute when it came to beating people up . <p> So she insisted that Cranmer be arrested , and tried , not for treason , which would have put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off on a treason charge because he did n't really support Lady Jane Grey , but on the charge of heresy , for introducing the protestant reformation . But , the difference between a treason trial and a heresy trial was that a treason trial would take place in the queen 's court , in the secular court . It could have been very quick and very swift and off with your head and that would have been the end of it . That 's what happened to the others in the Regency Council . A heresy trial , though , meant going through the church . And anything that went through the church was slow . And not only slow , but fraught with all kinds of impediments . You could n't just put someone on trial in a church court and expect a quick result , because they had to go through all sorts of various complicated procedures of one kind or another . And of course , ironically , Cranmer had the right of appeal to the pope . Remember , the pope is in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , you are stringing the procedure out a couple of years . So this was a long , slow process . <p> In the meantime , though , Mary did n't have any time to loose , because the essential thing if she was going to get anywhere in the long term , she had to produce a successor . There was just no way that anyone would believe her or take her seriously , unless she had a credible successor . She was 37 and unmarried , never and easy situation , but in the 16th century , much more difficult than it would be today . Well , who is she going to marry ? In any case , Mary was not going to settle for any oldTom , Dick , or Harry . She wanted the right sort of match . She managed to land her second cousin , Phillip II of Spain . Now , the relationship , you will recall it was the son of Charles V , his mother was Juana , the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella , Juana 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , so Mary and Charles were first cousins , and Phillip is a second cousin to Mary Tutor . Somehow or another they managed to get this act together and Phillip who was twenty was told by his father that he had to make sacrifices for his country was married off to Mary who was 37 . And he went with , I imagine , a very heavy heart , to England . Obviously , the whole point of this marriage was pregnancy , and the sooner , the better . But , it did n't happen . Mary was a very sad person . <p> Mary was so desperate that she faked pregnancy for five months . She pretended that she was pregnant . This caused enormous consternation in the country . Because , as you know with these things , everybody suspects that she was faking it . She was n't widely believed . But what they were afraid of was that she would manage to fake it right through to the nine months were up , and then substitute another baby , and claim this other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was up to ; get a lady in waiting pregnant or something like that . This was a great fear among people . The Protestants did n't want that , because it would guarantee a Catholic succession . The legitimists , the people who had supported Mary in the first place did n't want that either , because it was n't fair , it was n't right . They believed the successor should be legitimate , and not fake . <p> Anyhow , this little drama was being played out for the better part of two years , because the marriage did n't take place until a little over a year after Mary had ascended the throne . The marriage took place in 1554 on the 25th of July . The pregnancy was announced some months after that , so it was in September or so . It was through the latter part of 1554 , the beginning of 1555 , that this little charade was being played out . <p> Meanwhile , during all of this time , Mary was busy undoing the reformation . Cranmer was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cranmers supporters were either in jail as well , or had fled the country . Parliament agreed to go back to Rome , to reconcile the country to the Catholic Church , but with one very important proviso . Remember the parliament did n't care about the Mass , or about transubstantiation , or that kind of thing . As far as they were concerned that was all theology and they were n't that interested . But the one thing that they were determined was not going to happen was that the Church was not going to be allowed to reclaim the monastic lands . And of course , I pointed this out the other day , when the monasteries were dissolved , the land was sold off to people who wanted to buy land , and there was no way that they were going to give it back . And so parliament did a deal , so they thought , with the queen . They said alright , we 'll let the pope back into England ; we 'll go back to Rome , provided it is very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land going to go back to the Church . The dissolution of the monasteries is going to remain a fait accompli . There is no way we are going to reverse that . Mary had very little choice . She knew that if she did n't agree , there would be a revolt on her hands , so she agreed to this . And the pope of the time was sufficiently political in his motivation to realize that he would have to accept this as well . And so they agreed . And in 1554 , England was officially reconciled to the Catholic Church on Saint Ambrose Day , the 30th of November . <p> Now , the person the pope chose to effect this reconciliation was a man called Reginald Pole , who is a very interesting person in his own right . Reginald Pole was one of Mary 's relatives . He was a cousin on Henry the 8th 's mother 's side - in other words , on the side which had lost in the civil wars of the 15th century , the so called wars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard the 3rd , in 1485 . In order to patch things up , he married Elizabeth who was the daughter of King Edward the 4th , in other words , he married a woman from the other side . So , Reginald Pole was on that side of the family . <p> And in fact the Pole 's , not Reginald himself , but other members of his family had earlier on in the century revolted against both Henry the 7th and Henry the 8th , claiming the throne . So , Reginald Pole was in fact a candidate for the throne , a possible rival . Now , nobody took this terribly seriously in his case , until Henry the 8th broke with Rome in 1534 . It just so happened at that particular moment that Reginald was in Italy . He got very nervous about what was going on in England , and realized that he could n't go back . So instead of going back to England , he went to Rome . He was welcomed in Rome by the pope , and rose quite high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a cardinal of the Roman Church . Now Henry reacted to this by killing all of Reginald Pole 's immediate family , including his mother . His mother was something like 83 , was executed just because she was of that family , and the fear that he was a potential rival for the throne . So Reginald Pole had no cause to love Henry the 8th . He could say that his family had been Catholic martyrs in the reformation . However , Pole spent these years in Rome and rose to be quite high in the papal service . <p> He also spent a good deal of time in dialogue with the Lutherans . Because , although he was who he was , by Catholic standards he was quite open minded . He believed that Luther had something to say . He was quite a sympathetic dialogue partner in dealing with Luther at this particular point . Well , as you know , that did n't work out in the end . Pole returned to Rome in 1541 empty handed , after having negotiated for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people like Pole , because 1541 was a year that a very different type of person appeared on the scene , a man whom we know as Ignatius Loyola . <p> Ignatius Loyola was a Spaniard , a soldier who had led a typical soldier 's life until he was wounded in battle with the French . During his recovery , which took a rather long time , he repented of his earlier life and decided that henceforth he would serve Christ , in the way that he thought was right . His service for Christ was of course not the sort of thing that Luther indulged in , but rather the opposite , because Loyola was converted to a very strict kind of papalism , not just Catholicism , but papalism . The defense of the pope was one of the top priorities on his particular agenda . Loyola gathered around himself an army . He was a soldier , after all . He wanted to create a spiritual army which would defend the pope . This spiritual army he called the Society of Jesus and its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were monks , but they were monks of a different kind . Up until this time , monastic orders had been of different kinds but they had mainly been concerned with the contemplative life , going off into a monastery , praying , and this kind of thing . That 's what Luther did . He went into the monastery and studied . The Jesuits did not have monasteries . The Jesuits were to live in the world and to fight in the world as soldiers , soldiers of the pope . The Jesuits were to take an oath of loyalty to the pope as their commander in chief . <p> They were to struggle on two fronts ; one against Protestantism , but two against the heathen . The scope for this was very great , because just at the time that Loyola was getting all this together , Spain and Portugal were settling down to their newly acquired colonial possessions and there were two huge empires out there which desperately needed evangelists . And it 's very important to realize that the Jesuits operated on two fronts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-protestant . But they also went out of their way to spread Catholicism in what we today would call the third world . And they did so with the kind of military methods that Loyola used . In other words , you line up people in front of you , and you say : you are going to get baptized , just as you would do with the army . Anyone who does n't does n't live to tell the tale . So , or course you have mass baptisms in places like Mexico . Now , that was the bad side . <p> The good side is that the Jesuits believed in looking after their converts . Remember , they have a military organization . They have to be credited with trying to protect their Indian converts against Spanish and Portuguese colonists . This was particularly true in Paraguay where they set up a whole Indian civilization in the jungle . They did their best to preserve the Indians and their culture from European aggression . This part of it they did extremely well . The Jesuits who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , and to Japan did their best to adapt Christianity to those cultures , to those societies . They preached Christianity in a way which would be understood and accepted by those cultures . In different places , they did extremely well . In China , for example , the Italian Jesuit , Matteo Ricci , was so successful that he was accepted as a Chinese . He was actually adopted as a Chinese , and he rose very high in the Imperial administration in China and was very deeply respected by the Chinese mandarin class , the ruling class in China . And a number of prominent Chinese became Christians , Catholics , as a result of Ricci 's form of evangelism . They were a very extraordinary group of people in this respect . <p> Question <p> Because Ricci sort of adapted , so much to Chinese culture of course eventually with all Rome repudiated it . <p> Well , it 's very hard to say , the Chinese have no way , what they were going to compare it with ? To them that was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you can blame Ricci . I think Ricci was doing what today you would call contextualization , cross-cultural communication , this kind of thing . I personally think he was very sincere in what he was trying to do . He was n't trying to corrupt Christianity , or downplay it or anything like that . How far can you do this ? How much is possible before you start to loose the essence of what you are trying to do . That 's a whole other problem . It did n't last , because Rome pulled the rug out a couple generations later , and said the Chinese rites and all that has all got to stop . Now this is a debate . You can argue back and forth whether this was right or wrong . But the important thing is they tried . They made a serious effort to evangelize beyond the European world , which had not ever been done before . Not since the time of the early church , had there been a serious evangelistic effort . And Protestants of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not until William Carey in the 1800 's did Protestant missions really begin . So the Catholic missions of the 16th century , however much they may be criticized , nevertheless were doing something that nobody else was doing . They 've left some very interesting remains in different places . In Africa , for example , where the Portuguese landed around the coast of Africa , you often find , even now , churches , mission stations and so on that they built , which are still there as architectural monuments . <p> Question <p> There is a remainder , a residue of this . It 's important when you think about the Jesuits to realize that this was one of the aspects of their mission , as well as attacking Protestants . <p> It was just at the moment that Pole came back from his last doings with the Lutherans , that Loyola turned up in Rome , and managed to persuade the Pope to license his order . It was n't automatic . You might think that the pope would be just delighted at the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying here we are ; we 're your army . But the pope took one look and said : I did n't ask for this . Where did you come from ? Things were not as friendly as they might seem initially . However , Loyola managed to win the pope over about this time . The Jesuits became officially recognized . What this meant was that the policy of the Roman Church towards Protestants became much tougher . <p> In 1545 , the pope was finally persuaded to call a Council of the Church to meet in the Northern Italian city of Trent . Trent was going to be the place where the Catholic Church was going to sort out its theology . Now , initially , thanks to the efforts of people like Pole , Luther and the Protestants were invited to attend . It was going to be a pan-Christian Council in which Catholics and Protestants would sort out their differences . That 's what the Emperor , Charles V , wanted . But , Loyola and his friends , said , hey , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down with heretics and sort out our differences . We 're right , they 're wrong . Any sorting out that is going to occur is going to be they are going to repent and come back into the fold and we 're not going to have any more of this nonsense about dialogue and compromise and all getting along together in one big happy family . Forget that . <p> And so the Protestants who were very wary about whether they should go or not , initially , they held back ; they did n't particularly want to go . They were afraid of what might happen to them once they got there . The Council opened without protestant participation . But it also opened without French participation . So it was n't just the Protestants who did n't turn up , initially . But , the Jesuits very much got the upper hand . As the Council went on , it became quite clear that the Council of Trent was going to be a Catholic Council called to define the position of the Catholic Church over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Protestant meeting . And any language of compromise or reconciliation was from this point on abandoned . <p> Now Reginald Pole , because of his position in Rome played a major part in the Council . During these years , it appears that he abandoned his earlier open mindedness . So , when the time came for him to be sent to England , in 1554 , he had already had several years of experience in anti-protestant polemic . He was there when Loyola and his friends came along and said we 've got to put a little bit of backbone into the Catholic Church or it will never survive . And so , when Pole finally went to England on his mission , he was all fired up for the task . 
@@35723300 @4723300/ <h> When You Stumble <h> A. Living a changed life <p> When we became Christians , we changed . We died with Christ to that old life and were raised to a new life " a new life of discipleship ; a life in which we submit our wills to the perfect , holy will of God . Our lives started to show the Fruits of the Spirit and we began to have God 's love where there was none before ; we started to have God 's joy and His peace , patience , guidance , goodness , faithfulness , gentleness , and self-control . In other words , our lives changed . Yet this new life of fruitful discipleship is n't automatic , is it ? God is at work in us . He is giving us His desires , and then He is giving us His ability to make those desires a reality in our lives . However , God will not force His desires upon us , will He ? He will not make us love . He will not make us be joyous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must take the next step . We must agree with God that we want His love , His joy , His peace , and His patience . We must take the next step and , empowered by God 's Spirit , be obedient to Him . God gives us the desire ; He gives us the ability , but we must take the step . For example , the Bible says , " Do not be conformed to this world " ; that 's a step . " Be transformed by the renewing of your mind " ; that also is a step . Well , amidst all the joy of our new spiritual lives , I do have some bad news . The bad news is that sometimes , if we 're like everyone else , we will fail to take that next step . We will act as if we were not changed in our conversion ; instead of love , there will be anger , which might develop into hatred ; instead of joy , there might develop a critical and a bitter spirit ; instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took me a long time to determine where I was going to raise this topic , because I know all of you are excited . There is so much joy when a person first becomes a child of God ; we realize that we are not going to spend eternity in Hell . We are going to go to Heaven and we realize that we have a new Father and a new family . Yet we need to know that challenges are coming . In fact , those challenges may already have come . So the questions are : " What are you going to do when you have n't taken that next step of obedience ? " <p> " What are you going to do when you stumble and fall in the Christian walk ? " <h> B. Defining three terms <p> Before I give an answer to the questions above , I need to define three terms that I 'm going to use throughout the rest of this talk : relativism , sin and temptation . <h> 1 . Relativism <p> The first word is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the concordance , but it describes the world in which we live , and it describes the culture out of which we have come when we became children of God ; that word is " relativism . " Relativism is the denial of the existence of absolute truth ; it 's the philosophy that there 's nothing necessarily right and there 's nothing necessarily wrong ; it says that truth is relative . Relativism says , " What is true for me may not be true for you . What is true for me this morning may not be true for you this afternoon . " Now , the world has a word for this : They call this " post-modern thinking , " or " post-modernity . " The Bible has a different word for it : It calls it " rebellion " against the authority of God . You and I , as children of God , believe that our Father is the Creator . As the Creator , we believe that He has the right and the wisdom to determine truth . There is absolute truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decrees to be truth . In fact , we believe that God himself is Truth . God is the all-wise Creator who determines what is true . We also believe that God is good all of the time , therefore , this all-wise , all-good Creator wants the best for His creation . This all-wise , all-good Creator gives us rules and guidelines . He has given us this Book , the Bible , and in this Book , He has told us what is true and false " what is right and wrong . God has told us what is best for you and for me . At times , we 're going to disagree with His judgment call , but truth is not relative , truth is what God has determined ; so therefore , what the Bible says is what is best for you and me . You have passages such as in the Book of Psalms . In Psalm 16:11 the psalmist understands this and he says are pleasures forevermore . " Notice that the psalmist does n't write , " Yeah , you gave me a bunch of rules that I have to follow and in Your presence I 'm just miserable because there 's all these things I ca n't do anymore and there is nothing good about this " ; that 's the sick , weird way that people look at Christians and also the way some Christians look at themselves . The psalmist understands that God has made known to us truth " the path of life . Only in His presence is there real joy . Only at His right hand we find pleasure . We are not relativists ; we believe there is absolute , moral , spiritual truth . We believe truth is determined not by the world , but by our Creator who is all wise and all good , and He wants the best for His creation ; that 's the starting point we have and it 's diametrically opposed to everything we 've been taught in this secular world . We are not relativists. <h> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the word " sin . " Sin is a word that we are familiar with , but let me make sure we have a good definition of it . Sin , at its most basic level , is missing the mark . Imagine an archer drawing his bow back and sighting down the arrow . He 's sighting for the middle of the target , which is his mark . He let 's the arrow fly and the arrow misses the mark ; that , at its most basic , fundamental level is what sin is " sin is missing the mark . Who establishes the mark ? Who says this is the middle of the bull 's eye ? Who says this is where our lives are to aim ? God does . Our all-wise , all-good Creator says , " That 's the middle . " We draw back the arrow of our lives and shoot it , and sin is when the arrow does n't hit the bull 's eye , but it goes aside . For example , what is God 's mark ? What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is concerned for our tongue ? Where is the middle of the bull 's eye for our tongue that get us into so much trouble ? Well , He tells us in to those who hear . " 5:4 says , " Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking , which are out of place , but instead let there be thanksgiving . " God has shown us where the middle of the bull 's eye is . He is saying , " As far as your tongue is concerned , it is to be so full of grace and thanksgiving , and it is to be so busy building up one another that there simply is no room or time to tear the other person down . " We know the middle of the bull 's eye , but what happens in our lives ? Despite the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , there are times when we say things like , " No , God , I know better than You . " " Your ways are not always best . " " You 're not always wise . " " This is just not the time to build up , to edify , or to extend grace . " So we gossip , slander , and hurt the other person . We destroy their reputation . We sow seeds of distrust and discontent . God has shown us the mark and has given us the bull 's eye . Sin is when we miss the mark " when we fall short . Sin is simply missing the mark " stumbling in our walk ; that is sin . <h> 3 . Temptation <p> The third word that I wanted to define is the word " temptation . " The word " temptation " simply means to entice to sin . Someone hurts us , and thoughts go through our head to respond in anger ; that 's the temptation . Or a woman walks by and " if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man walks by " something inside of us says to look her ( or him ) up and down ; that 's temptation ; that 's the enticement to sin . Let me share with you three things from the Bible about temptation : <h> a . Temptation Is Not Sin <p> Temptation is not sin . Thoughts fly through our heads and we say , " Where did that come from ? " That is temptation and not sin . Now , temptation becomes sin when we yield to it , right ? Temptation becomes sin when we yield and we do respond in anger or gossip and slander . Temptation becomes sin when we let our eyes dwell on that woman and we undress her in our minds . Temptation becomes sin when we fall into this fantasy relationship with some guy . Temptation can become sin when we yield to it , but temptation itself is not sin . <h> b . You Do n't Have To Give In to Temptation <p> I will show my age , as it will for some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from years ago : Flip Wilson got a lot of laughs with one line . Do you remember his line , " The devil made me do it " ? Flip Wilson made a lot of money and got a lot of laughs out of that line , but his theology was absolutely horrific . The devil ca n't make anybody do anything . Sin ca n't make us do something wrong . Understand that on the cross and in our conversion , the mastery of sin was completely broken in our lives . We no longer have to sin ; it 's still present , but its mastery , its domination , and its control was broken , and we do n't have to give in to temptation . There are promises all the way through the Bible along these lines . Jesus told the disciples in John 16:33 , " In the world you will have tribulation . But take heart ; I have overcome the world . " He conquered the world ; He destroyed the absolute power of sin . 1 John 4:4 , speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is greater than he who is in the world . " The God who is in us , through the Holy Spirit , is greater than Satan and anything else this world has . What is inside of us has conquered what is outside of us . Satan simply ca n't make us sin ; we sin because we want to . I sin because I yield to temptation , but never am I made to sin , and neither are you . The most important promise along these lines is in Paul 's letter to the church at Corinth . In I Corinthians 10:13 , Paul tells them , " No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man .... " Here 's what is going to happen if we 're like everybody else : Temptation is going to come and we 're going to feel completely alone ; we 're going to feel as if no one has ever been tempted like this before " no one has ever had this particular temptation . We 're going to feel as if no one had temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , " I 'm all alone and I 'm going to " ( that 's Satan , by the way , if you hear that voice ) . The promise of God is that " no temptation has overtaken you that is not common . " We are not alone . No matter how difficult it is , we 're not alone . If we are being tempted a certain way , other people are being tempted as well ; we are not alone . Then Paul continues , " God is faithful , and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability , " your ability to resist temptation , " but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape , that you may be able to endure . " Notice Paul goes not to some inner strength that says , " You know , when you get tempted , just gut it out , hang in there , you can fight it " ; that 's not where he goes . He goes where all good theology goes " he goes initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faithful . God has made certain promises to us , and our sovereign God is so in control of the circumstances of our lives that He has promised He will never allow a temptation to come into our lives to which we have to yield . We will never have a temptation in which we do n't also have some way , by the power of God , to resist . In fact , our all-wise , all-good , all-loving , sovereign God says that in the midst of the temptation there will be a way for us to move through and to not yield . God is not going to keep us away from temptation , but He is going to be with us in the midst of it . As we learn not to yield by the power of His Spirit , we grow in our Christian walk . We never have to sin ; we sin because we want to and we like it " I do , anyway . We do n't have to sin . We never have to give into temptation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't right . <h> c . God Is On Your Side <p> Please understand that God is on our side . This joy and excitement we are feeling as new Christians is real and there is victory in our walk as Christians ; a large part of that is because God is for us , not against us . God wants us to make it " to not yield to temptation . I had a basketball coach once that needed to read this passage because he wanted me to fail . I 've never had a basketball coach like this before , but it was free throws . It was an odd , dysfunctional , triangular relationship between free throws and me and the coach . Every time I got up to shoot a free throw , do you know what I heard ? " Miss it ! " or " Bet you five bucks you do n't make it ! " That was my coach ! I would hear the coach and the rest of the team say , " Bet you ca n't make it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed it . He was n't a very good coach . I missed a lot of free throws , too , but that is another story . God is not like my basketball coach . God does n't want us to fail . He wants us to succeed and not yield to temptation . In fact , He wants us to not yield so badly that He 's given of Himself to us , and His Spirit lives in us ; that 's how badly He wants us to win this battle . He 's going to give us the desire to win the battle , and then He 'll give us the ability to win the battle , too . Paul tells the Galatian church , " Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh . " Listen to the Spirit ; listen to what He says ; listen to the direction that He gives us , and then let His power be the power that helps us not to yield to temptation . God is on your side . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is for us . Temptation is being enticed to sin ; it 's not sin in itself , and we do n't have to give into it . Understand that we have the power of the risen Christ inside of us to help us not yield to temptation . <h> C. What do you do <h> 1 . Confess <p> Having discussed those three words , let 's get back to the original topic : " What are we going to do when we stumble and sin ? " What are we going to do when we miss the mark ? I can not emphasize this enough , because this is one of the defining moments in our spiritual walk . If we do n't get this right " if we do n't learn what God has called us to do in the midst of sin , we are going to be absolutely miserable the for rest of our lives ; I absolutely guarantee it . The most miserable position in the world is to have a foot in two worlds , and to be hanging onto the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see someone , who is a child of God , who possesses the power that raised Christ from the dead " it is the same power that 's working in us " hanging onto sin at the same time ; this is a defining moment for our spiritual lives . What are we going to do when we stumble and fall ? Scripture 's answer is very clear : Confess ; it 's as simple as that . Confess our sin . All that confession is , is simply agreeing with God that we missed the mark ; that 's all it is . We say , " God , you are100% right , and I am 100% wrong . I know the middle of the mark is to have my tongue so filled with grace , understanding and love that there is no room to be critical . I blew it . I 'm sorry . " That 's all that confession is - admitting that you missed the mark , that God 's right and you 're wrong . One of the best-known passages is in the Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where not in us . " If anyone thinks they 're free from sin , they 're just deceived , which is what sin is . Right ? However , " If we confess our sins , then God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . " Again , John goes to the character of God and says that God is a faithful God " He is a just God . God is committed to forgive our sin if we would but confess . <h> 2 . Psalm 51 <p> If confession of sin is a new thing for you ( and it may be for some ) , I 'd encourage you to go to the middle of the Bible , to the Book called Psalms , and look at Psalm 51 . Psalm 51 is probably the best model of confession that there is anywhere in the Bible . Let me read some of the verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feel of what real biblical confession looks like : " Have mercy on me , O God , according to Your steadfast love . According to Your abundant mercy , blot out my transgressions . " ( Psalm 51:1 ) Notice that David , the writer , knows that he does n't deserve to be forgiven , so he appeals to God 's mercy . " Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity . Cleanse me from my sin . " ( Psalm 51:2 ) David understands that forgiveness lies ultimately with God . " For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me . Against You and You only have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight . " ( Psalm 51:3 ) Although we sin against people , all sin ultimately goes to the heart of God and David knows that . Verse 7 , " Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean ; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow . " He knows that forgiveness is Cast me not away from Your presence and take not Your Holy Spirit from me . Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit . " Beautiful words ! I would encourage each one you that if you were ever to find yourselves in a situation where you need to confess and the words just do n't come , go find a Bible and fall on your knees and crack it open to the middle . Just read Psalm 51 and say , " God , may this be my heart , and may these be my words to you . " As we go through the Psalm , we will start to see the principles of confession . We 'll see that David makes absolutely no excuses ; there are no excuses at all in Psalm 51 . There is no idea that he is a victim , but rather it is a complete and total admission of sin by saying , " You 're right , God , you 're completely right , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin is really bad . There is no desire in Psalm 51 to minimize sin or to say , " Well , you know , I mean , I 've done worse things , and it 's not really that bad " ; there 's none of that in Psalm 51 . David agrees that sin is horrific ; sin is a wretched thing . Then David calls on God to forgive him ; not because he deserves it , because he does n't ; but he calls on God 's character of mercy and grace and says , " Because of who You are God , I ask You to forgive me . " David knows that he will be forgiven . Psalm 51 is a marvelous model of what real biblical confession looks like , and one against which we need to hold up our understanding of confession and see if our version of confession is or is not biblical . <h> 3 . Tendency to do the opposite <p> Now , I need to tell you " and it may not happen right now " but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the exact opposite of Psalm 51 . Again , sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but sin is sin ; it 's been sin for centuries , and it does n't change much because it 's so effective the way it is . I do know that in my life and in the lives of people that I know , our human tendency ( otherwise known as our sinful tendency ) is to do the exact opposite of what David does in Psalm 51 . Sin is still present in our lives , is n't it ? Its mastery has been broken , but it 's still there " nipping , biting , and chomping at our heels because sin knows the power of confession . Sin knows what confession unleashes in the merciful heart of God , and so it whispers into our ears things like : " No , make excuses . " " Do n't accept all the blame for what you did . " " Certainly , you can find someone to blame . " " Certainly , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reason it 's so effective is that it 's coming from the inside , and so we really hear the whispering of sin . Sin whispers , " No , do n't fully confess ; just confess enough so that you can avoid most of the circumstances . " These confessions are not deep and gut wrenching such as : " God , against You I have sinned . " " I am wretched in my sin . " " I can not believe that You will forgive me , but I do believe that You will forgive me . " " I am so , so sorry . " How many times on our lips has there been that kind of confession ? So often , confession is just enough so that we can avoid the consequences of our sin , and of course , none of this is true confession ; none of this brings full forgiveness , and none of this brings cleansing . Only a Psalm 51-kind-of-confession brings full cleansing . <h> D. Practical suggestions <p> Allow me to give a couple of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Get It Over With <p> The tendency I have , and I think most people have , is to mull it over for awhile " to think whether it is really that bad . Just get it over with . Confess it early . Confess it often . Confess it fully . Just get it over with ! As you or I hold onto our sin , what we 're doing is only hurting ourselves ; we are only falling farther down the spiral of sin , and we are only damaging our relationship with God , and the walls are going up . The thing about confession that is also important is that when you and I confess , we 're not telling God something He does n't already know ; it 's not like we 're going to hang onto this deep , dark secret , and we 're not going to tell God ! Just get it over with . Confess early . Confess often . Confess fully . God sees what goes on at 1:00 in the morning . God hears what we whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and in our hearts ; we 're not keeping anything from Him " we 're not telling Him anything He does n't already know . You and I are the ones who are being hurt when we refuse to confess our sin . <h> 2 . Confess Your Sin to One Another <p> A second piece of practical advice is to simply confess our sin to one another ; this is not just a good idea , this is the Bible ( James 5:16 ) . Part of the lie of sin is that while we 're in the darkness of sin and we think no one else knows that we 're fighting with this sin , sin will tell us things such as : " Do n't tell anybody . " " It will only get worse if you tell anyone . " " No , just keep this to yourself and work with it . " " If you told another Christian , you 're giving them power over you " giving them authority . You do n't want that ! They 'll gossip about you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you heard that voice ? It 's the voice of Satan ; it 's the voice of sin ; it 's the voice of the lie . The fact of the matter is that the power of sin is snapped when we bring it to the light . If we were in a different environment and we were all being honest , we could probably all tell stories of times in which the sin was yanking at us and pulling us down , taking us farther and farther down that spiral . Then we start to get desperate , wondering how we are ever going to get out of this sin . In obedience to Scripture and perhaps in desperation , we finally to go to someone we trust and confess to them saying , " I need you to pray for me . " What happens when we do that ? It 's over , is n't it ? It 's amazing how the power of sin is snapped when we bring it to the light . Right ? Right ! Get it over with and confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here . Sin never goes away until we die and go home . Part of the Christian walk is learning to deal with sin . In the midst of our sin and our confession , we are being changed from one degree of glory to another so that we look more and more like Jesus Christ ; that 's what this is all about . Right ? <h> E. Receive his forgiveness <p> So we confess our sin . What happens when we confess ? We receive His forgiveness . I John 1:9 , " If we confess our sins , " because of His very character of being a faithful and a just God , He absolutely commits Himself , " to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . " Perhaps as our Christian walk develops , we may get caught in sin and we 'll ask , " How could God love a sinner like me ? " The answer is that He loved us before conversion , why would He not love us now ? He loved us when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now that we are His children ? The thought may go through our minds , " But how could God really love someone who keeps on doing the same things over and over again ? How can he really forgive me ? " The answer : Because He 's God , and that 's what being God is about . I would struggle if you kept sinning , and even though I know the Bible says I have to keep forgiving you seventy times seven " just keep forgiving " it 's hardbecause I 'm human . God is n't human ; He 's God and He 's a faithful God . God is committed no matter how much we sin , or how many times we commit the same sin , or no matter how bad it gets . If we confess our sin and say , " God , you 're right , I 'm wrong , " He will commit Himself , always , with no exception , to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . <h> F. Be cleansed <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleansed , then go to Psalm 103 ; this is another one of those model Psalms on confession . If you 're caught in sin and want to be forgiven and ca n't find the words , find Psalm 103 . Read it as your own words . I 'm going to start at verse 8 , " The Lord is merciful and gracious , slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love . He will not always chide , nor will He keep his anger forever . He does not deal with us according to our sins , nor repay us according to our iniquities . For as high as the heavens are above the earth , so great is His steadfast love toward those , " who are His children , " who fear Him ; as far as the east is from the west , so far does He remove our transgressions from us . As a father shows compassion to his children , so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear Him . For He knows our frame ; He remembers that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God has determined what is true and false , what is right and wrong , and what is good and bad . He is our all-good , all-wise Creator , who wants His best for His creation . With all of the joy and all of the victory that there is in the Christian walk , there 's also sin ; there 's stumbling and falling ; there 's yielding to temptation and missing the mark . Please , confess your sin . Confess early . Confess often . Confess fully . Tell God , " You are absolutely right and I am absolutely wrong . No one else is to blame . I messed up . I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . " God is committed to forgive , and we will enjoy the freedom that comes from being forgiven and cleansed . <h> G. Psalm 32 <p> I want to leave each of you with one last Psalm . Another model Psalm for confession is Psalm 32 . Starting in verse 3 the psalmist describes what it was like not to confess sin . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not confess my sin to God , " my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long . For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me ; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer . " In another Psalm he talks about his tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth . However , what happens when he does confess his sin ? Verse 5 , " I acknowledged my sin to you , and I did not cover my iniquity ; I said , +I will confess my transgressions to the Lord , ' and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . " Then back to verse 1 , " Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven , whose sin is covered . Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity , and in whose spirit there is no deceit. " 
@@35723301 @4723301/ <h> Paul 's Teaching on Sin <h> I. The Fundamental Sin <h> a . The Failure to Honor God <p> We are going to talk now about sin . I think the fundamental sin is dishonoring God . Why did Paul have to engage in mission ? He needed to engage in mission because the fundamental sin of human beings is the failure to honor and praise God . He needed to engage in mission because human beings are separated from God . They are not in a right relationship with him . <h> 1 . The Gentiles <p> We see that especially in Romans 1 , starting at verse 18 . There Paul tells us : " God 's wrath is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness . " What truth do they suppress ? Verse 19 : they suppress what can be known about God . What can be known about God is plain to them . Why ? Because God has shown it to them . So even people who can not read or write or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we know that ? By verse 20 : for God 's invisible attributes , God 's qualities . And what qualities does he have in mind ? That God is powerful and that He is God " His eternal power and divine nature . The qualities of God that are clear to all peoples everywhere are that He is powerful and that He is God . <p> How do they know these truths about God ? Paul says : " God has made it plain to them . " God has shown it to them . How has he shown it to them ? He says these things have been clearly perceived since the creation of the world in the things that have been made . When people look at the sun and the moon and the stars and the seas and the oceans and the mountains and thunderstorms and hurricanes and wind storms , and the beauties of nature , the rivers and the waterfalls , they know that there is a God . And they know that He is powerful . They do not need a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . <p> But , Paul argues , they have suppressed that truth . They have held that truth down . Verse 21 : they knew God through nature . Through the world He created they know God . But they did not honor Him as God or give Him thanks and praise . They did not respond rightly to this revelation that is given to them through nature . They suppressed it . So they are without excuse . Paul gives no evidence that anyone responded to this revelation rightly . Instead they responded to this revelation in a way that was not pleasing to God . Although they knew God , they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him . <p> But , instead of honoring and thanking and praising God , they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened . So they did not think correctly about God . They thought they were wise ( verse 22 ) , but they became fools . And they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images " for idols resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they turned away from God and worshipped other gods and trusted in them " whether it was the trees or birds or animals or statues of human beings or fetishes or whatever it is . In the Western world people often worship money or sexuality . They exchanged ( verse 25 ) the truth about God , the glory of God for a lie . They worshipped and served a creature rather than the Creator who is blessed forever , amen . <p> The root sin for Paul is not actually lying or cheating or murdering or committing adultery or dishonoring parents . The root sin is the failure to honor and praise God . All these other sins , Paul makes clear , are a consequence of failing to honor and praise God . <p> Notice Paul says : therefore , because they failed to worship and praise God the way they should , God gave them up to the lust of their hearts , to impurity . And we see the same thing in verse 26 : " For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator . Verse 28 : " Since they did not see fit to acknowledge God , God gave them up to a debased mind . It was their failure to acknowledge God that led to all other sins . So the root sin is idolatry . The root sin is worshipping other gods rather than the one and true only God . The root sin , we saw this last time , is the failure to maximize God 's praise , honor and glory . We are to be God-centered and Christ-centered in all we do . And sin is a failure to honor and praise Him . <p> Of course , that is not a whole of what sin is . Sin is also the wrong actions that we do . But it comes from ( as Paul says in Romans 2:5 and we find often in the Old Testament ) being stiff-necked " from being stubborn ; from failing to respond to God . <h> 2 . The Jews <p> And , of course , in Romans 1 and 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor God , but also the Jews who had the Old Testament law . They had the law , but they did not obey it . They fell short of keeping God 's commands . So , sin is a failure to submit to God and His glory . We see in Romans 2:21 , Paul says to the Jews : You teach others , but do you teach yourself ? You preach against stealing , but do you steal ? You say that one must not commit adultery , but do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ? So , the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of Jewish disobedience " because of their failure to do God 's will . Their stubbornness in their hearts comes about in their refusal to keep what God has commanded . <h> 3 . All Humanity <p> And Paul is very emphatic that all , without exception , are sinners . In Romans 3:18-20 , there is none righteous . There is not even one . There is no one who seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt . And , of course , this fits with the Old Testament as well . The Old Testament also teaches that all sin and fall short of what God has required . All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God . <p> In fact , Paul often emphasizes that no one can be right before God by keeping the law , by the works of the law . The works of the law , in Paul , refer to the deeds ( the actions ) that are commanded in the Old Testament law " in the Mosaic Law ; in the law given at Mount Sinai . That law gives works ( deeds ) that are to be carried out . But Paul says no one is justified before God by the works of the law . No one is righteous before God by the works of the law , because everyone fails to do those works . What God requires is those works are actually carried out . And we see that in Romans : " Now , we know that whatever the law says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament law , it speaks to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be stopped . No one has any defense of themselves . And the whole world may be held accountable to God . For by the works of the law , no human being will be justified in His sight . No human being will be right before God , since through the law comes the knowledge of sin . So the law can not save . <p> Gentiles , who can not read and write and do not have a book , are not saved through the revelation of nature , because they suppress that revelation and they refuse to worship and honor God . And Jews are not saved through the works of the law , because no one keeps that law . They all fall short of what the law requires . God requires perfection . No one does everything that God requires . <p> Galatians 3:10 says : " For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse . For it is written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things written in the book of the law to do them ' . " So , God says there is a curse on anyone who does not obey everything " absolutely everything " He commands . And , of course , no one can do , as Paul has made clear in Romans . No one can do all that God has commanded . And so no one can be righteous by works of the law . Or , as Paul says in Ephesians 2:9 , 2 Timothy 2:9 and Titus 3:5 , no one can be righteous by works , since God demands perfection and since human beings sin . There is no hope for those who try to be right with God by the things they do . So , sin is not only a dishonoring of God and the failure to glorify Him , but that failure to glorify God manifests itself in the way we live and our failure to do what God has commanded . <h> b . Boasting and Pride <h> 1 . Boasting of our own Goodness <p> Sin is very broad-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boast about how good they are and how they are better than other people and how much good we have done . And Paul emphasizes again and again that boasting and pride are eliminated for those of us who are Christians . We are to boast only in Christ and Him crucified . In 1 Corinthians 1:26-31 , Paul makes clear that we have no reason to boast , because God chose us to be saved . We are not saved because of how good we are . We are saved because God has chosen us to be His own . That is why we are saved only through the message of the cross . <p> Paul wrote 1 Corinthians so that the Corinthians would not be proud , because pride is another way of speaking of the root sin , is n't it ? When we are proud , we are focused on what we have done and what we have accomplished and our own obedience or goodness . And there is no room for pride before God . All the glory and honor and praise goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong in these chapters is that they are proud of their strength . They are proud that they can eat foods offered to idols rather than the weak . So they think they are strong . It is the same thing in 1 Corinthians 12-14 . The problem with the Corinthians is they are proud of their use of their spiritual gifts . They think that because they speak in tongues that they are better than other believers . But Paul has no use for such a high estimate of themselves . Simply because they speak in tongues , that says nothing about their own spiritual maturity . Their spiritual maturity would be marked by love and humility , not by the pride they are exercising because of their spiritual gifts . <p> We see the same thing in 2 Corinthians 10-13 . The false teachers there are proud of their spiritual exploits . And that is an indication that they really do not know Christ " that they are false apostles . And Paul says the same thing about the false teaching in Colossae , that it leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs that someone does not truly know God " that someone is focused on themselves rather than God . There is no room for boasting. <h> 2 . The Boasting of Israel <p> Israel was apt to boast because of its obedience of the law . So Paul , again and again , in his letters speaks against legalism . I define legalism as the belief that we gain merit before God by what we do " that we stand in the right before God by what we do . But Paul rules that out does n't he ? He says : " Then what becomes of our boasting " ( Rom.3:27 ) . It is excluded . By what kind of law ? By a law of works ? No , but by a law of faith . Of course boasting would not be eliminated by works , because we are naturally going to boast in our works . If we do the works , we are going to boast of what we have accomplished . But boasting is ruled out because we are justified only by faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of law . So right standing with God does not come by what we have done , but only by faith in Jesus Christ and not by works . And so the fundamental sin there is the trust in ourselves . And we continue to see that in these verses . <p> Romans 4:2 " " If Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about . " If he actually did the works and kept the law perfectly , he has something to boast about . And that is true . But he has no reason to boast before God , because he did not do the works . He sinned . He was an idolater . Joshua 24:2 makes it clear that Abraham was an idolater and did not know God before he was saved . He was saved what ? By faith . Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness . So he had no reason to boast in his works . <p> Now to the one who works , his wages are not counted as a gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , then we can take credit for belonging to God for our good works being the basis of our right relationship to God . But that is not what Scripture teaches . Scripture teaches that salvation is not by our works , because we have all sinned . And therefore there is no reason to boast . It is to the one who does not work but believes in the one who justifies the ungodly , his faith is counted as righteousness . So the faith that saves is not the faith that boasts . We see again here that boasting is part of sin " that when we rely on our works . <p> Paul says this over and over again to the Jews , does n't he ? He says in Romans 9:31 " Israel , who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness , did not succeed in reaching that law . Why ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as if it were based on works . They thought they could be right with God by what they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore they stumbled over faith in Christ , because they were focused on their works and their boasting . <p> Romans 10:1 " " Brothers , my heart 's desire and prayer to not according to knowledge . " There is a zeal for God that is truly a zeal , but does not save . And that is what is the case here . These Jews have a zeal for God , but it is not a saving zeal . Why ? We see in verse 3 : they are ignorant of God 's righteousness . They are ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God . And therefore they are seeking to establish their own righteousness , so they can boast . So here we see the heart of sin again . What is the heart of sin ? It is seeking to establish our own righteousness . Sin says that we are good . So the Jews did not submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law resulting in righteousness to everyone who believes . How does righteousness come ? Righteousness does not come by doing " by our works . Our righteousness comes by believing " by trusting in what God has done for us in Christ . For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law : that the person who does the commandments shall live by them . The righteousness of the law is based on doing and performance and it leads to establishing our own righteousness and boasting in it . But the righteousness of faith looks to what God has done for us in Christ : in bringing Him to earth and in raising Him from the dead and in trusting Him for every good work . So it is a new kind of righteousness that is distinct from what we would think and believe as human beings . We would think that we become right with God in a different way , but God surprises us . <p> We see the same thing in Philippians 3 . There Paul , again , is thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beware of the evil workers and beware of the false circumcision . So , these people again , they trusted in their works and what they had done , instead of trusting in God . But who is the true circumcision ? It is those who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus . <p> So I hope you can see how this is tied together with the main theme that I have been saying is the center of Paul 's theology , to glory in God in Christ . What is the problem with works ? The problem with works is we put confidence in the flesh . We trust in ourselves instead of glorying in Christ Jesus . We glory in what we do and we have accomplished . We boast in ourselves instead of glorying in Christ Jesus . But those who trust in God , they worship what God has done in Christ . <h> 3 . Boasting in Paul 's Experience <p> They do not put confidence in the flesh as Paul did . Before Paul was saved , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being an ethnic Jew , by knowing the Hebrew language , by being a Hebrew of Hebrews . He could speak the native language . He trusted to the fact that he was a Pharisee and very committed to the law , to his great zeal for God manifested in persecuting the church . He even says he was righteous under the law . He was righteous . As to the righteousness of the law , he was blameless . But whatever gain I had , he says , I count it as loss for the sake of Christ . These things did not save . I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . <p> Here we see the center of Paul 's theology again . The center is knowing God in Christ , is n't it ? The center is giving everything to Christ . For His sake , I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish , that I may gain Christ . So Christ is the center and the circumference of Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is either righteousness by the law or righteousness in Christ . So he says : " And comes through faith in Christ . " The wrong kind of righteousness is our own righteousness . It is a righteousness that comes from our obedience to the law " that comes from our own works . But that is the wrong kind of righteousness , is n't it ? That is not the righteousness that saves and delivers . The righteousness that saves is the righteousness that is a gift . <p> Sin means we focus on ourselves ( Eph.2:9 ) " that we focus on our works , rather than on faith in Jesus Christ . We focus on what we can accomplish , rather than what God accomplishes through us . It is just so helpful again to see what the heart of sin is . It is not doing wrong things ; it is boasting in ourselves . Of course , I should not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but it flows out of a self-worship . <h> II . The Power of Sin <h> a . Enslaving <p> Sin , of course , is also a power in Paul 's theology . It is something that rules over us . It is incredibly strong and enslaving . So in Romans 5:21 , Paul can say that sin rules over us . In Romans 6:6 , 6:16 , 6:17 , 6:18 , 6:20 and 6:22 , he says that sin enslaves . Before we were believers , sin enslaved us . It ruled over us utterly and totally and completely . Now that we are in Christ , that is not the case . It is good to know ( to understand ) how powerful sin was before we were saved . And we were slaves to it . We were not free from the power of the sin . We were totally under sin 's rule . We did what we wanted to do as sinners . When we were sinners , before we are saved , we did what we want to do . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sin , because we are under sin 's reign . We are under its power . <p> Of course , Paul says in Romans 6:12 , that believers must not let sin reign and rule in their lives because they know Christ . That slavery of sin has been broken in Christ ( Rom.6:14 ) . Sin will not rule over you . But we see here the power of sin before we are believers . Sin rules over us , so that Paul often speaks of being under the power of sin . <p> He can say we are under a curse , under the curse of the law ( Gal.3:10 ) . We are under the power of sin ( Gal.3:22 ) . We are under the law ( Gal.3:23 ) . We are under the pedagogue ( Gal.3:25 ) . We are under the law ( Rom.6:14-15 ) . We are sold under sin ( Rom.7:14 ) . We are under the elements of the world ( Gal.4:3 ) . <p> Those who are under the law , under the old covenant " under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are under the law " are under sin for Paul . They are under a curse . To be under the law is to be under sin , because the law provides no power for transformation . The law represents God 's good and perfect will , but it can not change our hearts . It does not transform us . So even though the law is good , sin co-ops it and uses it for its own nefarious purposes . So powerful is sin that it can take something beautiful like the law and use it for its own purposes so that believers are sold under sin . All those who are under the law are also under sin " those who are under the old era of redemptive history . <p> Paul can say in 1 Corinthians 15:56 " " the power of sin is the law " . The law is completely under the dominion of sin , so that believers are no longer under the law . Now , we will say more about that , I hope , later . That does not mean there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who are under the law ( Rom.7:14-25 ) can not do what they want . They are sold under sin . They are taken captive to sin . So sin is so powerful that it rules completely over those who do not know God . <p> We see the letter/spirit contrast in Paul in Romans 2:29 , Romans 7:6 and 2 Corinthians 3:6 . And in every case , the letter , which represents the law " the law that is written , God 's good and holy and perfect law " but the letter kills Paul says . The letter can not give life . The letter can not transform us . The law has no power for those who are not saved , so great is the power of sin . Notice what Paul says in Romans 8 . He says the mind set on the flesh is death . In Romans 8:7 , the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God , for it does not submit to God 's law . Indeed , it can not . Unbelievers can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who are in the flesh can not please God . The flesh has no power to do what is right and to please God and to do His will . <p> What human beings need is the Holy Spirit . They are impotent to please God and do what pleases Him . We need to see the very strength of sin in order to understand how great is the salvation accomplished for us in Christ Jesus . Human beings are impotent to spiritual things . The sin consists in failure to welcome the things of the Spirit . We see that in 1 Corinthians 2:14 , where it says the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God . This is what sin consists of : a failure to welcome the things of the Spirit . For they are folly to him and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned . He does not welcome and receive them as beautiful and lovely , because he does not have the Spirit . So the natural person hates the things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , but takes pleasure in unrighteousness . <p> We see that in 2 Thessalonians 2:9 . We see that as the coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonder and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing . And why are they perishing ? That means going to hell there , does n't it ? Because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved . <h> b . Deceptive <p> So here is another dimension of sin . It is the refusal to love the truth . We have seen it is a refusal to glorify and honor God . It is to be a slave to sin and in bondage to sin . We have seen that we are not saved by the works of the law , because we all sin . And therefore , here it is those who took pleasure ( as verse 12 says ) in unrighteousness . So , bondage to sin is such that those who are in such bondage delight in being in that bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoicing in what is good and rejoicing in what God has done in Jesus Christ . Instead of glorifying Him and trusting in Him , they find delight in what is evil and what is not pleasing ultimately to God . <p> The God of this world ( 2 Cor.4:4 ) has blinded the minds of unbelievers . They are held captive by Satan to do his will . So , there are also spiritual forces ( demons and the devil ) that hold people in captivity while they are unbelievers . Unbelievers are under the control of the world , the flesh and the devil . We see that very clearly in Ephesians 2 . He says : " And you are dead in your trespasses and sins . " What does it mean to be a sinner ? He means to be dead " not just to be sick , not just to be weak , but to be dead in trespasses and sins . " In which you once walked following the course of the this world . " So there is the influence of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of other people " the environment in which we live ; the social setting in which we live ; the culture in which we live . We follow the course of this world . We follow the lives of others who are around us . We imitate the way they lived and we lived in a similar way . We follow the prince of the power of the air " that is Satan " the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience . Before we are saved , we follow what Satan does . And then there are the passions of the flesh " carrying out the desires of the body and the mind . So doing what we desire before we are saved " it is the world , the flesh and devil is n't it . And we were by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind . We were under the wrath of God ( Eph.5:8 ) . <p> We were in darkness . Sin is also described as being in darkness . We are not under the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see the light before we are believers . Sinners only see darkness . Unbelievers are destined for wrath ( God 's anger ) on the last day ( 1 Thess.1:10 ; 5:9 ) . Unbelievers are under the dominion of idols ( 1 Thess.1:9 ) . They worship idols . They find their delight in idols . They trust in idols , instead of the true and the living God . The power of sin in unbelievers is to live in lawlessness ( 2 Cor.6 ) . It is to live in darkness . It is to live under the reign of Satan ( or Belial as he says here ) . It is to be an unbeliever . It is to focus on idols . It is to be living in that which is unclean . All of that is what it means to be an unbeliever . We saw earlier in Ephesians , it is to be without Christ , without hope , without God , separated from the commonwealth of Israel . Clearly not saved . <h> III . The Legacy of Adam <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the Spirit ? Which the flesh , in Paul , does not just mean our physical bodies . God made our physical bodies and our bodies are good . But because of our participation in Adam 's sin , we are born into the world as flesh . We need new resurrection bodies . So Paul can speak of the works of the flesh . But the works of the flesh are not just physical . We see that in Galatians 5:19-20 . The works of the flesh are not just sexual sin or drunkenness . Those are the works of the flesh , are n't they ? Sexual sin and drunkenness . But they are also enmity and strife and hatred and dissension and factions . So the works of the flesh are not only physical sins . We see in Romans 13:13-14 that besides drunkenness and sexual sin and carousing and reveling , the works of the flesh are also strife and jealously . We see in Romans 7:7-25 that one of the works of the flesh is coveting " desiring other things . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippians 3:3-4 that one of the works of flesh is pride . <p> We are born in Adam " sons and daughters of Adam . We are in the flesh because we are born as children of Adam . We are not of the Spirit . Those in the flesh , as we saw , can not keep God 's law . So , at least for believers , Paul emphasizes again and again that we are not to give into the flesh , because it is the false teachers who want to boast according to the flesh ( 2 Cor.11:18 ) . They war according to the flesh ( 2 Cor.10:3 ) . The Galatian opponents want to make a good showing in the flesh ( Gal.6:12-13 ) . The Philippian opponents want to boast in the flesh ( Phil.3:3-4 ) . But the works of the flesh ( Gal.5:21 ) will not inherit the kingdom of God . Part of what it means to be a sinner is to be in the flesh . Part of what it means is to be in Adam " what it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under the control of the old Adam . <p> We see this in Romans 5 starting in verse 12 . " Therefore just as sin came into the world through one man and that one man is Adam and death through sin . " So death was the consequence of sin , the one man Adam 's sin . But death spread to all through him . So we are sons and daughters of Adam , are n't we ? We die because we are sons and daughters of Adam . And so spiritual death spreads to all . And as a result of that , all sin because of spiritual death . We are all born spiritually dead in Adam . Because we are Adam 's sons and daughters , we do not enter into this world alive when we are born . We enter into this world spiritually dead . <p> Sin was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not counted where there is no law . Before there were even the commandments of the law " the commandments given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sin , technically speaking , where you do not have a law written . Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses . So here we see the reign of death , even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam , who is a type of the One who was to come . So Adam 's sin and the consequences of his sin spread to all , so that all died . We see this , for many died through the one man 's trespass ( verse 15 ) . All people died through Adam 's trespass . Death came into the world through Adam 's sin ( Rom.5:16 ) . <p> The judgment following one trespass brought condemnation . So the judgment on us follows Adam 's trespass and sin , and it brings condemnation to all . Because of one man 's trespass ( that is , Adam ) , death reigned through that one man ( verse 17 ) . Death reigns over all , because of Adam 's sin . Because of Adam 's one sin , death has spread to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Adam 's sin . One trespass led to condemnation for all men ( Rom.5:18 ) . Adam 's one sin led to the condemnation for us all . The one man 's disobedience " that is , Adam ( verse 19 ) . By the one man 's disobedience , the many were made sinners . <p> So I do not think anything can be clearer than that Adam 's sin has affected us all . We fall short of what God has required , because we are born in Adam as sinners . And we need the grace of God to be released from the power of Adam 's sin . We do not enter into this world as good people . We enter into this world as people who are evil " who are under the power of sin and death , because we enter into the world as Adam 's children . We enter into this world as condemned and destined to death and separated from God spiritually . <p> We see this as well in 1 Corinthians 15:21-22 " " For as by a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection of the dead . " Who is the man by whom death came ? Adam . 1 Corinthians 15:22 makes that clear . " As in Adam all die , so also in Christ shall all be made alive . " So there we see the power of sin in that we are sinners through Adam . <h> IV . The Rationale for Mission <p> So , here we have seen why Paul engages in his mission . He engages in his mission to bring the message of the glory of God in Christ and the need for salvation , because all people are sinners . All have dishonored God . They have refused to honor and praise God the way they should . We have rejected the revelation that God has given us through the natural world . We have violated God 's law . We have not observed the works of the law . We have done what is evil . Even though we have not done what is pleasing to God , we boasted about our obedience , even though it is not even impressive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept God 's law . But Paul has made it very clear that there is no reason for boasting , because we have all sinned . We are under bondage to sin . Sin is a power that rules over us , that enslaves us and reigns over us . And we are under a curse . We are under sin . We are under the law before we are saved . We are under the pedagogue . We are in bondage to sin . We can not do what we want . The letter of the law kills . We can not keep God 's law . <p> We need the Holy Spirit . We do not welcome the things of this Spirit . We do not welcome the love of the truth . We take pleasure in unrighteousness . We are under the dominion of Satan . Satan has blinded us and we are held captive by Satan to do his will . We are under the authority of the world , the flesh and the devil . We are in spiritual darkness . We are destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are under the dominion of idols . And we are under the dominion of the flesh and our fleshly desires , which are not just physical sins . And then we are born in Adam as condemned and judged and spiritually separated from God . We need a new way to be saved , do n't we ? We need the power of the gospel . We need Jesus Christ . <p> The Lordship of Jesus <p> And so that is the theme of Paul 's theology , is n't it ? And that is what I want to speak about next is that Jesus is Lord . Jesus rules . Jesus succeeded where Adam failed . Jesus is the second Adam . Jesus is the new Adam . Adam brought death into the world , but Jesus brought life . He was raised from the dead and here we see the theme of the resurrection . The resurrection is the indication that God 's promises have come to pass " that the new age promised in Ezekiel has arrived and come and that we live in that new age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not yet consummated , it has been inaugurated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ . He has delivered us from the present evil age through his resurrection . Life has dawned because Jesus has conquered death . <h> I. Jesus Reverses the Mess of Adam <p> Adam has introduced a great mess into the world , but Jesus has reversed that mess for those who belong to Him . He has delivered them from the dominion of sin and Satan . You know what a great thing it is to clean up something that is messy . We all know how easy it is for something to be devastated . It does not take long to devastate a home or a business or anything . We can destroy very quickly by war or pillaging or just destruction . Things can become messy and unorganized quickly . But it takes a great deal of effort and time and often money to make something right and that is what Jesus had done , has n't he ? He has reversed the consequences of Adam 's sin . He has cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are new people now in Him . There is just such a new and remarkable work in Christ and the resurrection , because the greatest devastation of all is death and Jesus has reversed that death for us . <p> He is the one new man ( Eph.2:15 ) . We are a new man in Christ . We are not the old man Adam . You can see this in Ephesians 4:22 and 4:24 and Colossians 3:9 and Romans 6:6 and Romans 13:14 . We are to put on Jesus Christ as the new man , as the new Adam . If we belong to Christ , we are part of the new Adam . We are part of the new humanity . The only way to escape what Adam has done is to belong to Jesus Christ and to be joined together with Him . Adam was created according to the image of God , but Jesus is the image of God ( 2 Cor.4:4 ; Col.1:15 and Rom.8:29 ) . He perfectly represents God to us . So to be in Christ is to belong to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Christ as the image . <h> II . Jesus Brings a New Creation <p> If we are in Christ ( which we saw in Ephesians 1:3-14 ) , we are in the new humanity . We are part of the new creation ( 2 Cor.5:17 ) . We are redeemed . We are sons of God . We are brought near in Christ . We are reconciled in Christ . We are chosen in Christ . There is no condemnation in Christ . We are one in Christ . We are seated in the heavenlies in Christ . We are free in Christ . That is the fundamental issue for Paul is whether we belong to Christ . <p> It is interesting in Galatians that the whole issue there is : Are you a part of the family of Abraham or not ? Are you of the seed of Abraham ? Are you part of the offspring of Abraham ? Those who are saved from the sin of Adam are those who belong to Abraham . And what Paul emphasizes there is that Jesus is the only true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the true seed of Abraham . In Genesis 12:3 , we see that all nations will be blessed through Abraham . That blessing that comes through Abraham only comes through Jesus . Abraham , we read in Romans 4:13 , would be the heir of the world . The whole world will be blessed through Abraham . But that blessing of Abraham , we are told in Galatians , comes only through Christ , because Christ is the only true and genuine seed of Abraham . <p> So if one wants to escape the power of sin that we have looked at , one can only escape it by belonging to Jesus Christ . He is the true seed of Abraham . He is the Son of David . He is the Son of man . He is the Servant of the Lord . We must belong to Him . Of course , Jesus is not only the seed of Abraham , Jesus is Lord . He is exalted on high . He is the Ruler of all . He is confessed as Lord . That is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept Jesus as Lord " to acknowledge that salvation comes in Him . Paul says in Romans 10:9 that when we confess Jesus as Lord and believe in our hearts that God raised him from the dead , we will be saved . <h> III . Following Jesus as Lord <p> And Colossians 2:6 says that we are to continue to follow Jesus as Lord . So what it means to be a Christian is not simply at one point in time accept Jesus as Lord , but to continue to acknowledge Jesus ' Lordship " to live out that Lordship in everyday life ; to submit to His Lordship . We conquer the power of sin when we submit to Jesus as Lord " when we receive Him as Lord ; when we follow Him as Lord ; when he is Lord over everything we do : when He is Lord over our sexual lives ( 1 Cor.6 ) ; when we do everything in His name ( Col.3:17 ) . When we live in harmony with each other ( Phil.4:2 ) , we acknowledge Jesus as Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acknowledged Jesus as Lord . When we respect leaders ( 1 Thess.5:12 ) , we receive Jesus as Lord . When we turn away from false teaching , we are following Jesus as Lord . When we are not ashamed of the gospel , we are following Jesus as Lord . When wives are submitting to their husbands , they are following Jesus as Lord . When children obey their parents , they are following Jesus as Lord . When slaves obey their masters , they are following Jesus as Lord . In everything in life , we are to follow and accept Jesus as our Lord . And I will continue that in my next lecture . 
@@35723302 @4723302/ <h> Why Study Christian Doctrine <p> The first book of theology I ever studied boldly headed its first chapter with the title , The queen of the sciences " Theology , and the writer claimed : " Seeing that Theology has for its domain the knowledge of God and His works , it is only just to regard it as the noblest of all the sciences " the very queen of the sciences . " Today we are not sure of its position , and one wag has said that it might be better called " The knave of arts . " Within universities and colleges , Christian theology is often regarded as an unscientific subject using its own highly subjective methods and producing results which can have no possible claim to scientific validity . It has become fashionable to turn away from theology to " religious studies " , the comparative examination and description of the various religions of mankind , including Christianity , from an allegedly impartial and scientific point of view . <p> If the study of Christian theology is not highly regarded in Faculties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth one 's attention . If it is to be studied at all , let this be done by ministers and preachers who have a professional interest in it . The ordinary Christian does not need to burrow deeply into a subject which seems to have caused lots of confusion in the church and which has little apparent relevance to the Christian life . Is it not the case that on occasion people who have dabbled in theology have become bewildered in their faith and even " unsound " ? And have we not all heard of young people , keen for Christian service , who went away to theological college and emerged again after three or four years with all the life knocked out of them and their cherished beliefs reduced to a sad state of confusion ? Beware , then , of reading any further in a book such as this one ! <p> But of course all this is a sad caricature of the real position " although , admittedly , with sufficient grains of truth in it to make a reader wonder whether I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many universities and colleges nowadays have departments devoted to the study of politics . One of the lecturers in the subject during my student days resigned his post to work in the headquarters of a political party . Clearly he had a particular commitment to the truth of one political outlook , and he was ( and is ) by no means alone in his allegiance . Another lecturer , whose own politics are probably somewhat pinkish in colour , told me that he keeps his own allegiance dark , so that the students will not think that they have got him nicely pigeon-holed and be able to say , " He only says that because he is a .... " Lecturers in politics and other subjects are very often committed to the truth of one understanding of the subject . Yet this does not prevent them from attempting to teach their subject objectively and scientifically , and in general people do not question their good faith . The situation of theologians is somewhat similar . They are committed to the truth of what they teach , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nevertheless , they aim to teach with academic integrity and impartiality , and they are prepared to question and examine their own beliefs so that they are well-founded . <p> There is clearly a difference between the study of theology and religious studies . The latter is largely descriptive and comparative and attempts to understand the various religions in terms of the natural causes and influences that account for their particular histories and characteristics . The former sets out the content of Christian belief , but does so in terms of its nature as a statement of what Christians ought to believe . It accepts the Christian faith as true , and attempts to state it systematically . Now , of course , there can also be Muslim theology or Buddhist theology , statements of what the adherents of these religions consider to be true , produced by people who believe in their truth . Fair enough . It is then possible to compare these systems and to see what elements of truth each of them may contain by comparison with one 's own position and to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians will work from their Christian standpoint , they will nevertheless be open to consider what elements of truth there may be in these other systems . <p> There is a place , then , for both theological study and religious studies , and in both cases it is possible to work with intellectual honesty and with an open mind . <h> What is Theology ? <p> Before we ask what value there may be in the study of theology or Christian doctrine , it may be helpful to ask exactly what is involved in the study itself . " Theology " is a word of a familiar type , being similar to words like " biology " , " pharmacology " , and so on , in which the ' -ology ' part designates the study or science of the subject denoted by the first half of the word ; in this case ' theo- ' is derived from the Greek word theos , meaning God , and hence theology is the study of God . The other word in use , " doctrine " , is derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christian doctrine is what Christians teach . <p> It follows from these considerations that the subject-matter of theology is God . Naturally it is not concerned merely with God in himself , but with the activity of God and with every area of human thought and experience that is affected by belief in God . <p> But we are talking about Christian theology , and therefore the concern of the theologian is with what Christians believe about God . Christian doctrine is a statement of what Christians believe . Such statements might be found in the creeds and confessions of the church that were drawn up to express the beliefs of those who framed them . The task of theology is to state what Christians believe in a systematic and orderly fashion . <p> We may look at the matter from another point of view . We have just been speaking about what Christians believe , as if Christian faith were a matter of believing certain things in our heads , statements that can be expressed in propositional form . But the simplest Christian knows that Christian faith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theology , therefore , asks the question , What does it mean to have a personal trust in God ? We can say that theology is an expression ofwhat it means to trust in God , and this way of putting the matter does justice to the fact that Christian belief is more than simply assenting to certain statements ( which even demons can do , James 2:19 ) . <p> We might be tempted to think that Christian theology is thus based primarily on the introspection of believers as they ask themselves what it is that they believe " and there might be as many different theologies as there are believers . But the source of Christian theology is not primarily Christian experience , but rather divine revelation . Our knowledge of God depends on what God has revealed of himself to mankind , and our Christian experience itself is determined by this revelation , which tells us what is involved in belief in God . While God has revealed himself in many different ways , the primary revelation is to be found in the Bible . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal himself , and , above all , presents the historical person of Jesus , through whom came his supreme revelation . It also gives the inspired " commentary " by prophets and apostles , which brings out the significance of these events . This point will require fuller elucidation later , but for the moment we can say that Christian doctrine is an exposition of God 's revelation of himself in the Bible . <p> There are , of course , other views of the source of Christian theology . Some people would attach much more importance to the analysis of the religious experience of Christians . Others would attempt to develop Christian theology on the basis of the revelation of God in nature or on the basis of philosophical discussion . Clearly there is a place for such studies within Christian doctrine , but the standpoint of this book is that the Bible is the basic and normative source for Christian doctrine , and that other sources of knowledge stand in a subordinate position to its supreme authority . <p> This consideration is based on the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's self-revelation to mankind . In theology we are bound by what God has said and are not free to indulge our own speculations , which may be right or wrong . Christian theology , accordingly , has a normative or binding quality . It is not simply a descriptive statement of what Christians believe ; it expresses what Christians ought to believe on the basis of God 's revelation . This aspect of the subject is sometimes indicated by the use of the term " dogmatics . " <h> Christian Doctrine and Bible Study <p> If we already have God 's revelation in the Bible , someone may well ask why we need to study Christian doctrine : surely it is sufficient to be a Bible student without bothering about doctrine ? Perhaps the simplest answer to this question is that anybody who studies the Bible is , in fact , really studying doctrine . When one of our universities instituted a " Department of Biblical History and Literature " , the hope of the founders may have been that the Bible would be studied without any reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the works of Shakespeare without reference to their literary quality . <p> The Bible is a doctrinal book , and it can not be studied without some reference to that fact . But the Bible is not a systematic statement of doctrine . Paul , for example , did not set out to write systematic theological treatises when he wrote his epistles ( with the possible exception of Romans ) ; he was writing occasional documents , meant to deal with the current problems and needs of particular congregations . But his writings presuppose his understanding of Christian theology , and that understanding is expressed piecemeal in them . The theologian tries to work out from his epistles the systematic character of his thinking . Again , what the Bible has to say on any particular topic is not necessarily to be found all in one place . ( That is why the most useful aid to Bible study after the Bible itself is a concordance . ) The teaching of the Bible about creation is not confined to the first chapters of Genesis , but is spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Colossians 1 . In order to understand what the Bible says on any topic , it is necessary to assemble all the relevant passages , compare them with one another and so arrive at a comprehensive statement of the teaching of the Bible . <p> And we can not stop there . What the Bible says about creation needs to be related to the discoveries of scientists and the insights of philosophers , so that the Christian may have a critical understanding of the thinking of his contemporaries and may be able to frame his own understanding of creation , based on all available sources of knowledge and intelligible to modern people . Christian theology thus involves relating what the Bible teaches to human knowledge gained in other ways . If all truth is God 's truth , then the Christian can not spurn any source of knowledge in attempting to find out how God has revealed himself . This applies even to the teaching of other religions and philosophical systems , which may contain a mixture of truth and error . To most Christians the teachings of Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it would be foolish to ignore the possibility that somewhere in the Communist system of thinking there may be insights into human nature and behavior that are true in themselves , independent of the non-Christian framework in which they appear . <p> A systematic discussion of Christian theology will take the student to many sources of knowledge and areas of thinking . Our purpose here will be the more modest one of attempting to set out the biblical teaching that forms the foundation of Christian theology . <h> The Use of the Bible in Theology <p> How is the Bible to be used in the study of Christian doctrine ? A few comments may not be out of place . <p> First , it must be emphasized that the Bible is the principal source for the theologian . It is here , as we shall see in the next chapter , that God has revealed himself to us most fully . Consequently , all other sources of knowledge about God must be tested by the Bible . <p> Next , we need to study the message of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in their contexts . In the past , some theologians have been strongly and justifiably criticized because they based their theology on " proof-texts " which they dragged indiscriminately from all parts of the Bible and whose interpretation they took for granted without asking what they really meant . Some of the curious views of the sects result from this procedure . A man once tried to use a verse in Ecclesiastes ( I think it was 3:19f. ) to prove to me that there is no after-life . He did not stop to ask what the text in question originally meant , nor to ask how it fitted in with the teaching of the New Testament , which clearly testifies to an after-life . It is always best to study whole passages rather than isolated texts and to " compare Scripture with Scripture . " <p> A third point is that we should not despise the many helps to the study of the Bible that exist . Some people like to go it alone , thinking that their own insight into the Bible is sufficient , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their understanding . No doubt the main thrust of the Bible is clear enough , and the Reformers were right to insist on what they called the " perspicuity " of Scripture , over against the mass of traditions that had obscured its meaning in the medieval church ; but it would be sheer presumption on the part of any Christian to think that he or she can ignore the wisdom that God has given to other Christians and do their own thing successfully . There is a vast secondary literature in which the collective wisdom of God 's people is to be found , and here there is light to be found on the dark places of the Bible . By careful use of such books , we can vastly increase our own understanding of Scripture . <p> It goes without saying that students of theology need the guidance of the Spirit to help them in this task . There can be no better aid than the help of the Author himself to understand his book . A willingness to learn humbly from the Spirit of God is indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pride and self-sufficiency of a human mind that thinks that it has the native ability to understand the ways of God . <h> The Uses of Christian Doctrine <p> What is the ultimate value of this study , which Christians may be tempted to set aside as too difficult or simply as irrelevant to their Christian lives ? As Paul said , in answer to a different question , " much in every way . " One obvious reply is that the study of Christian doctrine will preserve the student from falling into error and enable therm to distinguish between what is true and false . A few years ago a number of people in a somewhat exclusive Christian sect , which up until then had managed to stay reasonably orthodox , were directed into some highly eccentric behaviour at the behest of a man who had attained a position of influence among them . It took a few years before many of them realized how they had been duped by a man whose teaching was crazy and whose own character fell far below Christian standards ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied doctrine more seriously and tested the instructions give to them by Scripture , they would not have been led astray as they were . In the sixteenth century there were Christians who practiced polygamy out of a mistaken understanding of Christian freedom , and today there are people who observe Saturday as their day of worship out of a confusion between the Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Lord 's Day . The antidote to such oddities is a sound knowledge of Christian doctrine . <p> At a more serious and personal level , Christian doctrine feeds the soul of believers and enables them to grow in Christian faith and understanding . Although the study of doctrine can be merely a matter of the mind , the mind can be the route by which the Word of God reaches the heart and influences the life . Christian doctrine , studied in a spirit of humility and prayer , opens up our minds to the revelation of God and provides spiritual food for believers . They learn more of the character of the God whom they worship , they understand more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they appreciate more fully the wonder of the divine grace that saved them , and they realize more of the spiritual possessions that God wishes to bestow upon them . <p> Christian doctrine thus provides the fuel for devotion . It sets the heart on fire with love for God and gives the inspiration for worship . It is arguable that much Christian worship is cold and formal , simply because it lacks an adequate basis in the presentation of Christian doctrine . Christian worship is the human response to divine revelation , and it is only when worship is based on the presentation of the Word of God to the congregation that they can respond with warmed hearts and give God intelligent praise and service . <p> Finally , only through the study of doctrine can Christians prepare themselves to be active in applying their faith to the problems of living and to the task of Christian witness . The evangelist must know his message and understand how it applies to the needs of the many different kinds of people whom he will meet . A person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate for it ; one can not expect to be persuasive if he or she has not studied the brief . <p> With these practical applications in mind , we can now turn to our subject . We shall look first in more detail at how we know about God ( ch. 2 ) and then at the nature of God ( ch. 3 ) and of the world , its creation and its fall into sin ( ch. 4 ) . This will lead on to consideration of God 's new start with the sinful world in Jesus Christ ( ch. 5 ) , and how God 's new creation becomes effective in the individual ( ch. 6 ) and the church ( ch. 7 ) . Finally , we shall look at the completion of God 's work at the end of time ( ch. 8 ) . <h> Questions for Study and Discussion <p> A Unitarian minister once put up a poster saying that he offered " religion without dogma . " Do you think that what he offered is possible ? <p> Can a Christian believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Is it possible for a person who is not himself a Christian to understand Christian doctrine fully ? <p> It has been said that " deep theology is the best fuel for devotion " : discuss . <p> Many sects base their peculiar doctrines on the teaching of the Bible . How would you show the validity or otherwise of their views ? 
@@35723304 @4723304/ <h> Chapter XXII : Sanctification and Perseverance <p> The doctrine of justification naturally leads on to that of sanctification . The state of justification calls for a life of sanctification , consecrated to the service of God . <h> 1 . Nature and Characteristics of Sanctification <p> Sanctification may be defined as that gracious and continuous operation of the Holy Spirit by which , He purifies the sinner , renews his whole nature in the image of God , and enables him to perform good works . It differs from justification in that it takes place in the inner life of man , is not a legal but a recreative act , is usually a lengthy process , and never reaches perfection in this life . While it is very decidedly a supernatural work of God , the believer can and should co-operate in it by a diligent use of the means which God has placed at his disposal , II Cor. 7:1 ; Col. 3:5-14 ; I Pet . 1:22 . Sanctification does not consist in a mere drawing out of what is already given in regeneration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortify the new life . It consists of two parts : the gradual removal of the pollution and corruption of human nature , Rom. 6:6 ; Gal . 5:24 , and the gradual development of the new life in consecration to God , Rom. 6:4 , 5 ; Col. 2:12 ; 3:1 , 2 ; Gal . 2:19 . While it takes place in the heart of man , it naturally affects the whole life , Rom. 6:12 ; I Cor. 6:15 20 ; I Thess. 6:23 . The change in the inner man is bound to carry with it a change in the outer life . That man must co-operate in the work of sanctification follows from the repeated warnings against evils and temptations , Rom. 12:9 , 16 , 17 ; I Cor. 6:9 , 10 ; Gal . 5:16-23 , and from the constant exhortations to holy living , Micah 6:8 ; John 15:4- 7 ; Rom. 8:12 , 13 ; 12:1 , 2 ; Gal . 6:7 , 8 , 15. <h> 2 . The Imperfect Character of Sanctification in This Life <p> While sanctification affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers remains imperfect in this life . They must contend with sin as long as they live , I Kings 8:46 ; Prov. 20:9 ; Jas. 3:2 ; I John 1:8 . Their lives are characterized by a constant warfare between the flesh and the spirit , and even the best of them are still confessing sin , Job 9:3 , 20 ; Ps. 32:5 ; 130:3 ; Prov. 20:9 ; Isa. 64:6 ; Dan . 9:7 ; Rom. 7:14 ; I John 1:9 , praying for forgiveness , Ps. 51:1 , 2 ; Dan . 9:16 ; Matt. 6:12 , 13 ; Jas. 5:15 , and striving for greater perfection , Rom. 7:7-26 ; Gal . 5:17 ; Phil . 3:12-14 . This truth is denied by the so-called Perfectionists , who maintain that man can reach perfection in this life . They appeal to the fact that the Bible commands believers to be perfect , Matt. 5:48 ; I Pet . 1:16 ; Jas. 1:4 , speaks of some as perfect , Gen. 6:9 ; Job 1:8 ; I Kings 15:14 ; Phil . 3:15 , and declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I John 3:6 , 8 , 9 ; 5:18 . But the fact that we must strive for perfection does not prove that some are already perfect . Moreover , the word ' perfect ' does not always mean free from sin . Noah , Job , and Asa are called perfect , but history clearly proves that they were not without sin . And John evidently means either that the new man does not sin , or that believers do not live in sin . He himself says that , if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us . I John 1:8. <h> 3 . Sanctification and Good Works <p> Sanctification naturally leads to a life of good works . These may be called the fruits of sanctification . Good works are not perfect works , but works that spring from the principle of love to God or faith in Him , Matt. 7:17 , 18 ; 12:33 , 35 ; Heb. 11:6 , that are done in conscious conformity to the revealed will of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have as their final aim the glory of God , I Cor. 10:31 ; Col. 3:17 , 23 . Only they who are regenerated by the Spirit of God can perform such good works . This does not mean , however , that the unregenerate can not do good in any sense of the word . Cf. II Kings 10:29 , 30 ; 12:2 ; 14:3 ; Luke 6:33 ; Rom. 2:14 . In virtue of the common grace of God they can perform works that are in external conformity to the law and serve a laudable purpose ; but their works are always radically defective , because they are divorced from the spiritual root of love to God , represent no real inner obedience to the law of God , and do not aim at the glory of God . In opposition to the Roman Catholics it should be maintained that the good works of believers are not meritorious , Luke 17:9 , 10 ; Eph. 2:8-10 ; Tit. 3:5 , though God promises to reward them with a reward of free grace , I Cor. 3:14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of good works must be asserted , Col. 1:10 ; II Tim . 2:21 ; Tit. 2:14 ; Heb. 10:24. <h> 4 . Perseverance of the Saints <p> The expression ' perseverance of the saints ' naturally suggests a continuous activity of believers whereby they persevere in the way of salvation . As a matter of fact , however , the perseverance referred to is less an activity of believers than a work of God , in which believers must participate . Strictly speaking , the assurance of man 's salvation lies in the fact that God perseveres . Perseverance may be defined as that continuous operation of the Holy Spirit in the believer , by which the work of divine grace that is begun in the heart , is continued and brought to completion . This doctrine is clearly taught in Scripture , John 10:28 , 29 ; Rom. 11:29 ; Phil . 1:6 ; II Thess. 3:3 ; II Tim . 1:12 ; 4:18 . And it is only when we believe in this perseverance of God that we can in this life attain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; II Pet . 1:10 . Outside of Reformed circles this doctrine finds no favor . It is said to be contradicted by Scripture , which warns against apostasy , Heb. 2:1 ; 10:26 , exhorts believers to continue in the way of salvation , Matt. 24:13 ; Col. 1:23 ; Heb. 3:14 , and even records cases of apostasy , I Tim . 1:19 , 20 ; II Tim . 2:17 , 18 ; 4:10 . Such warnings and exhortations would seem to assume the possibility of falling away , and such cases would seem to prove it completely . But as a matter of fact the warnings and exhortations prove only that God works mediately and wants man to co-operate in the work of perseverance : and there is no proof that the apostates mentioned were real believers . Cf. Rom. 9:6 ; I John 2:19 ; Rev. 3:1 . <h> To memorize : Passages to prove : <p> a . Sanctification as a work of God : <p> I Thess. 5:23 . " And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly ; and may your spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . " <p> Heb. 2:11 . " For both He that sanetifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one : for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren . " <p> b . Man 's co-operation in sanctification : <p> II Cor. 7:1 . " Having therefore these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God . " <p> Heb. 12:14 . " Follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord . " <p> c . The mortification of the old man : <p> Rom. 6:6 . " Knowing this , that our old man was crucified with Him , that the body of sin might be done away , so that we should no longer be in bondage to sin .

" For I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me , but to do that which is good is not . " <p> Phil . 3:12 . " Not that I have already obtained , or am already made perfect : but I press on , if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus . " <p> f .

@@35723313 @4723313/ <h> Chapter XX : Conversion : Repentance and Faith <p> When the change wrought in regeneration begins to manifest itself in the conscious life , we speak of conversion . <h> 1 . Conversion in General <p> The Bible does not always speak of conversion in the same sense . The conversion we have in mind here may be defined as that act of God whereby He causes the regenerated , in their conscious life , to turn to Him in faith and repentance . From this definition it already appears that God is the author of conversion . This is clearly taught in Scripture , Acts 11:18 ; II Tim . 2:25 . The new life of regeneration does not of itself issue in a conscious change of life , but only through a special operation of the Holy Spirit , John 6:44 ; Phil . 2:13 . But while in regeneration God only works and man is passive , in conversion man is called upon to co-operate , Isa. 55:7 ; Jer. 18:11 ; Acts 2:38 ; 17:30 . But even so man can only work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion too consists in a momentary change , and is not a process like sanctification ; but in distinction from regeneration it is a change in the conscious rather than in the unconscious life of man . While conversion is necessary in the case of all adults , Ezek. 33:11 ; Matt. 18:3 , it need not appear in the life of each one of them as a sharply marked crisis . The Bible mentions instances of conversion , such as Naaman , II Kings 5:15 ; Manasseh , II Chron. 33:12 , 13 ; Zacchmus , Luke 19:8 , 9 ; the eunuch , Acts 8:80 ff. ; Cornelius , Acts 10:44 ff. ; Paul , Acts 9:5 ff. ; Lydia , Acts 16:14 , and so on . Besides this it also speaks of a national conversion , as in Jonah 3:10 , a temporary conversion , which includes no change of heart , Matt. 13:20 , 21 ; I Tim . 1:19. 20 ; II Tim . 4:10 ; Heb. 6:4-6 , and a repeated conversion , Luke 22:32 ; Rev. 2:5 , 16 , 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of conversion in the strict sense of the word , which does not admit of repetition , but a revived activity of the new life after it has suffered eclipse . Conversion comprises two elements , the one negative and the other positive , namely repentance and faith , which call for separate discussion . <h> 2 . Repentance , the Negative Element of Conversion <p> Repentance looks to the past , and may be defined as that change wrought in the conscious life of the sinner by which he turns away from sin . It includes three elements , namely , ( a ) an intellectual element , in which the past life is viewed as a life of sin , involving personal guilt , defilement , and helplessness ; ( b ) an emotional element , a sense of sorrow for sin as committed against a holy and just God ; and ( c ) an element of the will , consisting in a change of purpose , an inward turning from sin and a disposition to seek pardon and cleansing . Rom. 3:20 ; II Cor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man primarily by the law of God . Roman Catholics have an external conception of repentance . According to them it comprises a sorrow , not for inborn sin , but for personal transgressions , which may merely result from the fear of eternal punishment ; a confession made to the priest , who can forgive sin ; and a measure of satisfaction by external deeds of penance , such as fastings , scourgings , pilgrimages , and so on . The Bible , on the other hand , views repentance wholly as an inward act , an act of real sorrow on account of sin , and does not confuse this with the change of life in which it results . <h> 3 . Faith , the Positive Element of Conversion <p> In distinction from repentance , faith has a forward look . <p> a . Different kinds of faith . The Bible does not always speak of faith in the same sense . It refers to a historical faith , consisting in an intellectual acceptance of the truth of Scripture without any real moral or spiritual response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows no real interest in it . Acts 26:27 , 28 ; Jas. 2:19 . It also speaks of a temporal faith , which embraces the truths of religion with some promptings of conscience and a stirring of the affections , but is not rooted in a regenerated heart . It is called temporal faith , Matt. 13:20 , 21 , because it has no abiding character and fails to maintain itself in days of trial and persecution . Cf. also Heb. 6:4-6 ; 1 Tim . 1:19 , 20 ; I John 2:19 . Moreover , it makes mention of a miraculous faith , that is a person 's conviction that a miracle will be performed by him or in his behalf . Matt. 8:11-13 ; 17:20 ; Mark 16:17 , 18 ; John 11:22 , 40 ; Acts 14:9 . This faith may or may not be accompanied with saving faith . Finally , it not only names , but stresses the necessity of , saving faith . This has its seat in the heart and is rooted in the regenerated life . Its seed is implanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be defined as a positive conation , wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit , as to the truth of the gospel , and a hearty reliance on the promises of God in Christ . <p> b . The elements of faith . We distinguish three elements in true saving faith . ( 1 ) An intellectual element . There is a positive recognition of the truth revealed in the Word of God , a spiritual insight which finds response in the heart of the sinner . It is an absolutely certain knowledge , based on the promises of God . While it need not be comprehensive , it should be sufficient to give the believer some idea of the fundamental truths of the gospel . ( 2 ) An emotional element ( assent ) . This is not mentioned separately by the Heidelberg Catechism , because it is virtually included in the knowledge of saving faith . It is characteristic of this knowledge that it carries with it a strong conviction of the importance of its object , and this is assent . The truth grips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ( trust ) . This is the crowning element of saving faith . It is a personal trust in Christ as Saviour and Lord , which includes a surrender of the soul as guilty and defiled to Christ , and a reliance on Him as the source of pardon and spiritual life . In the last analysis the object of saving faith is Jesus Christ and the promise of salvation in Him . John 3:16 , 18 , 36 ; 6:40 ; Acts 10:43 ; Rom. 3:22 ; Gal . 2:16 . This faith is not of human origin , but is a gift of God , I Cor. 12:8 , 9 ; Gal . 5:22 ; Eph. 2:8 . But its exercise is a human activity , to which the children of God are repeatedly exhorted , Rom. 10:9 ; I Cor. 2:5 ; Col. 1:23 ; I Tim . 1:5 ; 6:11 . <p> c . The assurance of faith . Methodists maintain that he who believes is at once sure that he is a child of God , but that this does not mean that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall from grace . The correct view is that true faith including , as it does , trust in God , naturally carries with it a sense of safety and security , though this may vary in degree . This assurance is not the permanent conscious possession of the believer , He does not ever live the full-orbed life of faith , and as a result is not always conscious of his spiritual riches . He may be swayed by doubts and uncertainties , and is therefore urged to cultivate assurance , II Cor. 13:5 ; Heb. 6:11 ; II Pet . 1:10 ; I John 3:19 . It can be cultivated by prayer , by meditating on the promises of God , and by the development of a truly Christian life . <h> To memorize . Passages showing : <p> a . That God is the author of conversion : <p> Acts 11:18 . " And when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life .

@@35723326 @4723326/ <h> Election and the Christian Life <h> I. God 's Election <h> a . The Fact of Election <p> When we think of God 's great work of salvation , we think of justification and sanctification and reconciliation and redemption and propitiation and salvation . But we also need to think of God 's election : God 's choosing of His people . In the Old Testament , Israel was chosen as the elect people of God , as God 's chosen people . They were chosen out from among the Gentiles . They were called to be a chosen people . We see that in Exodus 19:5-6 . We see in Deuteronomy 7 that Israel was not chosen because of its virtue . God set His love upon them because He loved them . They were , according to Amos 3:2 , known by God . They were chosen to be His . <p> So too , the church of Jesus Christ ( the new Israel ; the new people of God ; the true Israel ; the true people of Abraham ) , they are chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in Ephesians 1:4 that " He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world . " We read in Romans 9:11-12 that He chose Jacob rather than Esau before Jacob was born or had done anything good or bad . And we read in 2 Timothy 1:9 of the same . God 's purpose was before the ages . It was a pre-temporal choice ; a choice before history began . <p> So that excludes works as the basis of our choice . It says in Romans 9:11 , though they , Jacob and Esau , " were not yet born and had nothing either good or bad , in order that God 's purpose of election might continue , not because of works , but because of Him who calls . " So election excludes works . We see that in Romans 11:6 as well : " but if it is by grace if salvation is by grace , it is no longer on the basis of works . Otherwise grace would no longer be grace . " But we see in verse 5 : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by grace . " <p> So election and grace are closely tied together in Paul 's thinking and Paul 's theology . Election can not be separated from God 's grace and therefore salvation is not by works . God did not look ahead and see the good things we would do , as 2 Timothy 1:9 says : " who saved us and called us to a holy calling , not because of our works , but because of His own purpose in grace which He gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began . " So God 's salvation is totally by grace . It is not based on foreseen works . It is not based on foreseen merit . It is not based on foreseen faith . It is based on God 's choosing alone . Ephesians 1:4 we read we are chosen in Him , in Christ . And in 1 Corinthians 1:30 we see the same theme that we are chosen in Christ . It is by His doing you are in Christ Jesus . Election is the work of God 's grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of election is so that God would get all the praise and glory for our salvation . We can not boast that we have accomplished this salvation . There is no reason to praise ourselves . Three times in Ephesians , we are told that God 's choosing us , God 's redeeming us and God 's giving us the Spirit is for the praise of the glory of His grace . God 's choosing us before eternity began , solely on the basis of His grace , gives Him all the glory . It gives Him all the praise . It gives Him all the honor . <p> We see the same thing in 1 Corinthians 1:29 that no man can boast before God because God has chosen who would belong to Him . 1 Corinthians 1:31 " the one who boasts is to boast in the Lord . So election fits with the main theme that we have been talking about here . Those who are elect , give all the glory , all the praise , all the honor to God . He is magnified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to us , but to God . So it fits with the centrality of God and Christ in Paul 's theology " that we worship and praise and honor Him forever and ever for choosing us , for lavishing His grace upon us . We did not deserve to be chosen as sinners in Adam . We were sinners who have freely chosen to follow the lusts of the flesh . But God has bestowed His grace upon us in His mercy , by choosing us for the glory of His name . <p> Of course we see that God has chosen us to be holy in Ephesians 1:4-5 . We see that in Romans 8:30 as well . In 8:29 that He chose us to be conformed to the image of His Son . God 's choice to salvation fits not just with initial salvation , but with being transformed by God 's grace . <h> c . The Language of God 's Calling <p> Another word that Paul uses for His grace working in our lives is calling . God calls us by His grace . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word calling in Paul is an effective call . It is a call that secures what is intended . <h> 1 . The Effectiveness of God 's Call <p> We see perhaps the best example of that is in Romans 8:30 where it says those whom He predestined , He also called . And those whom He called , He also justified . Those whom He called , He also justified . We know that the word calling can not mean invited to be saved because it is not true , is it , that all those who are invited to be saved are justified . That would mean that all those who are invited to be saved are saved . But we know from many Scriptures that not all of those who are invited to be saved in that sense believe . Romans 5:1 says we are justified by faith . We are justified by believing . But only some believe . Not all believe . This verse though says : those whom He called , He also justified . All those who are called are justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called are justified , or most of those who are called are justified , but all of those who are called are justified . <p> The word calling must mean then that God 's call is effective : that God 's call creates faith ; that God 's call is invariably effective in those whom He calls . So , the word called is not an invitation but an effective calling . <p> Probably the best example of this in Scripture is the calling of Lazarus out of the tomb . Lazarus was dead . And when Jesus called him , the call was effective . Lazarus could not respond to the call because he was dead . He was dead in the tomb . When Jesus says : " Lazarus come forth " that is the call . Jesus ' words created life . And that is the same thing we see here . It is an effectual call . All those whom He calls are justified . <h> 2 . The Selectivity of God 's Call <p> So the calling is only for some . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in creation . God said : " Let there be light " and there was light . And so too , here , when God speaks , His word creates life . Of course Paul does not use the word calling , but he uses a very similar idea . In 2 Corinthians 4:6 " " For God who said let of Jesus Christ . " God has spoken His word and His word is effective and His word has given us life and has been effective in such a way . <p> God 's calling secures our final inheritance . We see in 1 Corinthians 1:9 " " God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . God is faithful to those who are called , as verse 8 says . He will sustain to the end , guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ . Those who are called will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different from the preaching of the word . The word is preached to all and only some are called . We see that in 1 Corinthians 1 , where Paul speaks of the preaching of the word . It pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe ( verse 23 ) . But we preach Christ crucified . We preach Him . We herald Him to all . He is a stumbling block to Jews and a folly to Gentiles . Christ is preached to all , but not all believe . Some of the Jews find it to be a stumbling block and some of the Gentiles find it to be foolishness . the wisdom of God . To those who are called , they see and understand that Christ is God 's power . Christ is God 's wisdom . So those who are called inevitably and definitely believe and respond to God 's grace . <h> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empasize the grace of God . We see the same thing where Paul is called to ministry in Galatians 1:15 . There Paul says : " but when He who had set me apart before I was born and who called me by His grace was pleased to reveal His Son to me . " The Damascus Road conversion of Paul is another good example of God 's effective grace , where He set him apart before he was even born . And then we know that Paul was opponent of Christianity ( as verses 13-14 say ) , even persecuting the church . And God supernaturally revealed His Son to him on the Damascus Road . He effectively called him . His voice turned Paul around and brought him to salvation . <p> The call in Pauline theology is contrasted with works . We see that in Romans 9:11-12 . We have already seen that . We see it in 2 Timothy 1:9 , verses I just read about election as well . We are not called on the basis of works . The calling is on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . We see in 2 Thessalonians 2:14 that He calls us to salvation through the gospel , so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ , so that there may be salvation on the last day . <h> d . God 's Love <p> Another thing we should note is God 's calling and election is closely tied to His love . We see that in Romans 1:6-7 ; Romans 9:13 ; Romans 9:25 ; Ephesians 2:4-6 ; Colossians 3:12 ; 1 Thessalonians 1:4 ; 2 Thessalonians 2:13 and Romans 11:28 . In God 's calling and election of us , we see an example of God 's merciful and undeserved love . We do not deserve to be called . We do not deserve to be saved . But God has shown His great love to us in electing us and calling us . <p> Therefore , we ought not to think that everyone deserves to be called or elected . We need to remember what Scripture teaches . All deserve to be damned , because we have freely chosen to sin . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being unfair . It is God 's mercy and grace that any of us were saved at all . That is the point of Scripture : the wonder and beauty and greatness of God 's grace that He would save any of us . That is the wonder . That is the praise . So , we need to have the Biblical standpoint on it . Our feelings and own wisdom may say something else . But what Scripture says is that the salvation of any is due to God 's mercy . <h> e . God 's Promises to Israel ( Romans 9-11 ) <p> Paul has a long discussion , in Romans 9-11 , on Israel . He asks the questions : What about God 's promise to save His people , Israel ? Has that promise not come true , since so many Israelites are not believing and trusting in Christ ? And what Paul argues in 9:6-13 is that God never promised that every Israelite would be saved . He never promised that every physical descendant of Abraham ( every Jewish person ) would receive ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God chose Isaac and not Ishmael . He chose Jacob and not Esau . So God 's word ( 9:6 ) is not fallen . God 's promises are always trustworthy . He always fulfills His word . His promise is effective . He never promised to save all . But those whom He does promise to save , He will save . <p> And He promised to save Isaac and Jacob . As we just saw , He chose Jacob , not based on his works , not based on anything he had done . He chose Jacob before he was born . It was not based on his foreseen faith . Jacob , actually if we read the Old Testament , had many problems in his life and was a sinner . And yet God 's grace was so great . His mercy was so great that He chose Jacob for salvation . He loved Jacob : that is , He chose him . That is the quote from Malachi . And he hated Esau ( Rom.9:13 , quoting from Mal.1:2 ) . He did not choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not deserve salvation . So God is absolutely just and fair in choosing Jacob , and not Esau , and lavishing and bestowing His love on Jacob , and not Esau . <p> But Paul does ask whether God is just to save one and not another ( Rom.9:14 ) . We might wonder : Is it unjust for God to do this ? Paul 's answer ( verse 15 ) is God has mercy on whom He has mercy . And He has compassion on whom He has compassion . For anyone to be saved , that is God 's mercy . Salvation is not something that is deserved . We ought not to think that God owes salvation to the Esaus of this world or anyone . The salvation of any is God 's mercy . It is totally undeserved . So it does not depend , as he says in verse 16 , on human will or exertion , but on God who has mercy . God has mercy ( verse 18 ) on whoever He wills and He hardens whomever He wills . He hardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is totally just in doing so . <p> Of course , Paul goes on to say : if God has mercy on whom He wills and hardens whom He wills , he asks the question we would ask . You will say to me then : Why does He still find fault ? For who can resist His will ? Has God done something wrong since His will is in control ? Paul does not appeal here finally to free will and to the choice human beings . Instead he says : " Be careful finite , little creature about telling God what to do . " But who are you , O man , to answer back to God ? Well , what does the molded say to the molder : " Why have you made me like this ? " Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use ? Be careful finite , little human being about trying to tell God how to run the universe . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has the right to do what He wants to do as the sovereign God . <p> Paul does not give an explanation here that answers all our questions . But he does emphasize God 's sovereignty and greatness . The potter has the right to do what he wants with the clay . Of course , those who go to hell deserve to go to hell . And they go to hell for their own sin . They go to hell because they have rejected God 's grace and power . But ultimately God does what He wishes . God has ( Rom.9:22 ) wanted to show His wrath and make known His power , showing how great sin is . And He endured with much patience with vessels of wrath prepared for destruction . He shows there His patience and ultimately His just wrath in punishing . And He did this in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy which is prepared beforehand for glory . When we see the just punishment upon the wicked , we realize that the salvation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , one reason there is a hell is so that God can demonstrate to us the punishment we deserve . This is the punishment we have escaped by God 's marvelous grace , so that the opposite shows us what we deserved . It is as if we all deserved to starve to death . And if you are very , very hungry and then you are given food , you are so much more thankful for food after you have been hungry . Or if you are very , very cold and then you experience warmth , you are much more thankful for the warmth . It is as if , of course , we all deserve in our sins to starve to death in hell forever or to freeze to death in hell forever . But God 's grace is like ( this is just an illustration of course ) His warmth being bestowed upon us or His filling us with food . It is all due to His wonderful mercy and care for us . We rejoice in the fact that , not that we deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care upon us even though we do not deserve it . <p> I should say that some argue that the issue in Romans 9 is not salvation . But it clearly is salvation , because Paul is willing ( as we see in Romans 9:3 ) to suffer judgment and hell for the sake of Israel , because Israel is cut off from Christ . And he prays ( in 10:1 ) that Israel would be saved . So the issue is salvation in these verses . Paul speaks of those who are the children of God in verse 8 and the children of promise in verse 9 and God 's calling . So God 's salvation is by His wonderful grace and we praise it forever and ever if we are vessels of mercy . <p> Of course , we can not forget Romans 10 . God 's election is true , but it is also the case that Israel stumbled and fell because they chose not to believe . We need to remember that we need to hold these things together . On the one hand , salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accounts for who is saved and who is not . And yet , Israel did not pursue the law by faith , but stumbled . Israel attempted to be righteous by works instead of faith . That is Romans 10 . They did not trust in God . They did not confess with their mouth that Jesus was Lord and believe , which you must do to be saved . They heard the message and did not believe . So Paul also emphasizes Israel 's responsibility : that they too had an opportunity to believe and did not receive it . So those who go to hell go to hell because they choose to go , but the only ones to go to heaven and experience eternal life and the new creation are those whom God has chosen to be His . <p> Ultimately , Romans 11 ends with the promise that all Israel shall be saved . I understand that to refer to the final end-time generation of Israel , at the time when Christ returns again . At that time , a great majority ( not every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israel will be saved and will trust in Jesus as their Savior and that is a result of God 's grace . He will open their eyes and they will see that Jesus is glorious and that He is Lord . They will believe corporately , but they will also believe individually at that time , that Jesus is Lord . <p> This great work of God is compared , in Ephesians 2:1 , to being raised from the dead . Those who are dead in trespasses and sins and who are under the control , as we saw yesterday , of the world , the flesh and the devil , they have been raised from the dead by God 's grace . It is another way of speaking of God 's saving work in raising them from the dead and granting them new life . In 2 Timothy 2:24-26 , Paul says that we ought to pray that God will grant repentance to those who disbelieve . Ephesians 2:8 tells us that faith is a gift of God . Those who believe , those who repent : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no praise and honor and glory for believing . All the praise and honor and glory goes to God for saving us . <h> II . The Christian Life <p> At this point , I want to start talking about the Christian life . The God who has saved us by His marvelous grace , how does He want us to live ? <h> a . Living Sacrifices <p> How He wants us to live is summed up nicely in Romans 12:1-2 , where Paul says : " I appeal to you , therefore , brothers by the mercies of God ... " He is appealing to them by God 's saving work in their lives : His mercies , His grace . This is the grace we have been talking about in His election and His choosing us . Of course , the mercies of God includes our justification , our sanctification , our redemption , our reconciliation , the fact that God 's wrath is propitiated , all that God has done for us in Christ Jesus . Because of God 's mercy , we are to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole selves to Him , body and soul , as a living sacrifice : as those who are now alive from the dead , because we are alive in Christ and we are to give our lives as a sacrifice to Him . Our whole lives belong totally to God . Such a sacrifice is holy and acceptable to God . That is our spiritual worship . The worship that God asks of us now is to trust Him in our lives and to give our lives to Him . <p> We are to not be conformed to this world ( as Romans 12:2 says ) , but to be transformed by the renewal of your mind . As Christians our minds need to be renewed and changed every day . Our thinking is not changed at conversion , as if it is completely right . We need to renew our minds by studying God 's word and growing in our understanding of what He teaches us day by day . So that is a constant process . We present out bodies to God as a living sacrifice every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is renewed every day , so that we can test and discern what the perfect , acceptable and good will of God is so that we can please Him in everything . <h> b . The Indicative and the Imperative <p> As Christians , we are already righteous before God , as we saw . We are holy and sanctified before Him . We are redeemed . And yet , there is a tension between what is often called " the already , not yet " . We are already justified . We are already redeemed . We are already saved . And yet we do not have the fullness yet of our salvation in our experience . There is a tension between the indicative and the imperative . <p> By the indicative , I mean what we already are in Christ . That is , we are justified . We are saved . We are sanctified . We are redeemed . And we are reconciled . And the imperatives are the commands that God gives us . And what we ought to say here is the indicative always must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved and sanctified must be the foundation . So the commands do not come first . But God 's grace always comes first and is fundamental in our lives . So the indicative relates to things such as this : that we have died to sin and we have died in Christ and we are alive in Christ . <p> Let me give some examples here of the indicative and the imperative . The first one is in 1 Corinthians 5:6-7 . This is the passage where Paul is calling upon the Corinthians to expel the person in the church who is practicing sexual sin and is not repentant . So he tells them to expel this person , because a little leaven leavens the whole lump ( 5:6 ) . It will corrupt and infect the whole community if they do not act . But then he says : Cleanse out the old leaven ( 5:7 ) . He is saying here : Remove the evil in your midst ; this unrepentant sin . Remove this person committing incest from the church , so the church would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a new lump " so that as a body , you may be pure and clean . But then notice he says : as you really are unleavened . <p> Verse 7 is the command ( the imperative ) : Cleanse out the old leaven . But now we see the indicative in 7b : You really are unleavened . You are already pure . So there is a tension here , is n't there , between the command to cleanse out the old leaven and then the indicative in verse 7b ? You really are unleavened . You really are already pure . And yet , you must cleanse out the old leaven to be pure . But the purity comes in Christ for Christ , our Passover Lamb , has been sacrificed . We are unleavened . We are pure before God , for Christ as the Passover Lamb died for our sins and purified us and cleansed us from our sins . So , on the one hand , we are unleavened . We are pure . And , on the other hand , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to be unleavened ultimately . <p> Another good example of this is Philippians 2:12-13 . Paul says here : " Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling . " So there is the command again : Work ; accomplish your own salvation . That is a very strange statement for Paul to say , because he has so emphasized that our salvation is totally the work of God . But now we have the command : Work out your salvation . But notice in verse 13 , that this salvation that we are to work out ( that we are commanded to do and accomplish ) is a result of God 's work in us : " For it is God who works in you , both to will and to work for His good pleasure . " So ultimately , our working out of salvation is due to God 's work in us . And here is the indicative . God gives us even the will ( the desire ) to both do and work for His good pleasure . So any good thing we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on what God has done for us in Christ . That is the indicative : God 's saving work . <p> We see this as well in Romans 6 . We are told that those of us who are in Christ ( those of us who are converted ; those of us who have been baptized as a sign and symbol of our conversion in Christ ) , that we have died to sin because we have died with Christ . Therefore , we have died to sin . Our old man ( who we were in Adam : that is , the old man ) no longer lives . And the old man is put to death . Our old self was crucified with Him ( Rom.6:6 ) . We are no longer enslaved to sin . We have died with Christ ( Rom.6:8 ) . So that is the indicative . That is what is true of us . And yet the imperative : we must not let sin reign in our mortal body to make you obey its passions ( Rom.6:12 ) . We have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must obey the command ( here is the imperative ) : Do not let sin rule . Because you have died to sin , do not let it rule . Verse 13 : " Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to God as instruments for righteousness . " So we are to pray for a transformation in us to obey God and do what He has called us to do . <p> We see the same thing in Colossians 2:20 , where he says : " If with Christ you died to the elements of the world ... " And we did die to the elements of the world . And then he gives us commands : Do not do this and do not do that . Colossians 3:1 " " If then you have been raised with Christ ... " And we have been . So here is the indicative . We have died with Christ . We have been raised with Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperative . Seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God . " Set you mind on the things above not on the things that are on earth " ( 3:2 ) . And then again , he has the indicative : " For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God . " So we are given the reason ( the grounding ) why we are to set our mind on things above : because we have died with Christ . Then come all the commands in 3:5 and following : " Put to death therefore sexual immorality " and so forth and so on . He lists all the sins . And we simply need to see here that these commands are rooted in the fact that we have already died with Christ . We are a new man in Christ . We are not what we were . In Colossians 3:9 , we are to put away anger , wrath , malice , slander , obscene talk and not to lie . And then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self . " So these commands are given because we are a new man and not an old man in Christ because of the indicative . <p> And yet elsewhere , in Romans 13 , Paul can say : " Put on the Lord Jesus Christ . " In Ephesians 4:22 , he can say : " Put off the old man and put on the new . " But we are already a new man in Christ . So we can never forget that the indicative is the foundation of the imperative . God 's commands are never primary ; His grace is always primary . We must beware of just preaching commands . Because , if we preach commands without emphasizing God 's grace and what God has already done for us in Christ , we become legalist . We focus on commands , instead of God 's grace and on the gospel . Paul always , always relates his commands to the gospel and what God has done for us in Christ : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new creature and a new creation . So that is something we should strive for in our preaching and teaching : never to give commands apart from explaining the gospel . And we need to do that in our sermons as well , do n't we ? When we preach we must strive simply not to give commands without proclaiming the good news of the gospel . Because otherwise we could fall prey to a kind of legalistic explanation of these things that does not fit with the Scriptural emphasis on what God has done for us in Christ . <h> c . The Work of the Holy Spirit <p> As believers , the power for our new life comes from the Holy Spirit . In Paul , we know that we belong to the people of God ( that we are Christians ) because we have the Holy Spirit . Those who do not have God 's Spirit are not saved ( Rom.8:9 ) . They do not belong to Him . The natural man ( 1 Cor.2:14 ) does not welcome the things of God , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul assures that the Galatians that they are Christians because , when they heard the message of the gospel , they received the Spirit ( Gal.3:2 , 5 ) . So the Spirit is the mark that one is a Christian . No one can say Jesus is Lord apart from the Holy Spirit ( 1 Cor.12:3 ) . The church of Jesus Christ is God 's temple in which God 's Spirit dwells ( 1 Cor.3:16 ; Eph.2:22 ) . <p> The gift of the Spirit is the fulfillment of God 's promise in Joel 2:28 ; Ezekiel 11:18-19 ; Ezekiel 36:26-27 ; Isaiah 32:15 ; and Isaiah 44:3 . It is the fulfillment of God 's promise . It is the sign that the new age of fulfillment has arrived . God has given the seal of the Spirit in the hearts of believers . We see that in Ephesians 1:14 ; Ephesians 4:30 ; and 2 Corinthians 1:21-22 . Those who know God will never fall away from Him , because they have the guarantee and the seal of the Spirit in their lives and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ratifies that we belong to God . And that seal can not be removed . Those who have truly received the Spirit will never fall away . <p> The Spirit is God 's first fruits ( Rom.8:23 ) . It is the pledge of our future redemption and of the fulfillment of God 's saving purposes in us . We understand God 's wisdom by the Spirit ( 1 Cor.2:6-16 ) . God has given us the Spirit so that we can know the things freely given us by God . And the Spirit is the power by which we live in the Christian life . We have begun in the Spirit and we continue and are perfected in the Spirit as well ( Gal.3:3 ) . We are never perfect in this life , but the Christian life we live , we live by the power of the Holy Spirit . We live by the Spirit and in faith . Just as we began the Christian life , we continue in the Christian life . <p> The letter of the law kills , but the Spirit gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that is pleasing with God . The Spirit , as Paul says in Galatians 5:13 and following , gives us freedom . Those of us who have the Spirit are free by God 's grace to do what is pleasing to Him and to fulfill His will . Perfect freedom is walking in , so to speak , slavery to what God has commanded . That is what we are to do . If we walk by the Spirit , we will not fulfill the desire of the flesh ( Gal.5:16 ) . We learn in verse 17 that there is a great battle in us between the flesh and the Spirit . As Christians , the desires of the flesh are not absent . The desires of the flesh have not gone away . There is still a great war and conflict in us . We all recognize that as Christians . It would be nice if , when we became Christians , the desires for sin were totally removed . But they are not totally removed . There is a great war in us . We still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our own wills instead of the will of God . And so the Spirit , though , gives us the power to not fulfill the desires of the flesh . If you are led by the Spirit , you are no longer under the law ( Gal.5:18 ) . You are no longer under the domain of sin that comes through the law . That is the work of God 's Spirit in us . <p> Romans 8 very much emphasizes the power of the Holy the law of sin and death ( Rom.8:2 ) . So there is a new power in us as Christians . We are not perfect , but we are remarkably transformed by the Holy Spirit . The righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us who walk according to the Spirit ( Rom.8:4 ) . Those who live according to the Spirit , Paul says , set their minds on the things of the Spirit . The mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit gives us strength to do what is pleasing to God . And this Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are God 's children as we live in a new way that is pleasing to the Lord . <p> So again we are reminded by this teaching on the Holy Spirit , that the power of the Christian life does not come from ourselves but it comes from God . We hope and trust in His work and not our own work , ultimately , for making it until the end . <p> Of course there is a great conflict , as we saw , in the Christian life ( Rom.7:13-25 ) . I wound argue that that passage is true both of Christians and non-Christians . It is true of non-Christians , because they are totally in the flesh and they can not do God 's will at all . They are sold under sin . They are captive to sin . And yet Christians still experience , in part , what we read about in those verses : doing what we hate and not able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , because we are still not perfected . The body is dead because of sin ( Rom.8:10 ) . We still experience that we are not fully redeemed yet ( Rom.8:23 ) . So , we still experience that battle with sin as well . We do not experience a perfect Christian life by the Spirit . We also can say at the end of the Romans 7:24 - " Who will deliver me from the body of this death ? " And deliverance from the body of this death , complete and final deliverance , will only take place on the day of redemption , on the final day . So we live in this battle . <p> And in the meantime , we are to be filled with the Holy Spirit as Paul says ( Eph.5:18 ) . How do we triumph in Christ ? It is by the filling of God 's Spirit . And we see in the parallel passage ( Col.3:16 ) that we are to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly . We are to be filled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's truth . We are to be filled with the Spirit by knowing the Scripture and studying the Bible and knowing Scripture well and teaching Scripture . Those who are filled with the Spirit will be joyful and sing songs . And they will have families that operate rightly and in a way that is pleasing to God . It is the power of the Spirit in us that accounts for our new life . <p> This work of the Spirit has an echo in our own faith and hope . We continue to hope in faith . We are called upon to look forward to the completion of what God has done for us . We have a great hope and certainty that is laid up for us in heaven ( Col.1:5 ) . We have the hope of our calling ( Eph.1:18 ) . Even our sufferings bring hope ( Rom.5 ) . We wait for a new creation ( Rom.8:18ff ) . We know that God will complete the good work he has begun in us ( Phil.1:6 ) . God is faithful . He will complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctified , but then he says the One who has called you is faithful ( 1 Thess.5:23-24 ) . He will do it . God is faithful ( 1 Cor.10:13 ) . He will protect us ( 2 Thess.3 ) . <h> d . Assurance and Perseverance <p> He will ensure that those who truly belong to Him will not fall away . We see this in Romans 8:28 " all those who are foreknown , predestined , called and justified , will be glorified . All those whom God has chosen will have the great hope and certainty that they will be saved . No one will lose their salvation . God has not appointed us for wrath , but the possession of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ( 1 Thess.5:9 ) . We have the assurance that all those who are justified and glorified will be saved from God 's wrath on that last day ( Rom.5:9-10 ) . If God is for us , no one can be against us ( Rom.8:31-39 ) . Those whom God has declared to be in the right will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has vindicated us in Christ . Nothing will separate us from His love . <p> So we have a great assurance . Those who fall away and do not continue to believe are those who were never truly part of the people of God . They were not authentic believers . 1 John 2:19 is helpful in speaking of those who have left the faith : " They went out from us , but they were not of us . " Those who leave the community of God are not truly saved . They went out from us , but they were not of us . For if they were of us , they would have remained with us . But they went out in order that it might be clear that they all were not of us . So those who fall away do not truly belong to God . <p> Of course , as believers we are called upon to persevere in faith to the end . There is the need for good works which is taught in many passages in Paul ( Rom.2 , 2 Cor.5:10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of our right standing with God , but the evidence that we have been saved . They are the fruit of God 's work in our lives . They are not the basis . We are to persevere by faith and in grace . The perseverance should not be confused with perfection . We are not perfect in this life . We continue to sin everyday and fall short in many ways . But we continue to repent of our sins and trust in Christ . We continue to put our hope in Him . Perseverance is not the same thing as works righteousness , since it is not the foundation of our right standing with God . It is responding in faith to what God has done , with the recognition that we all fall short in many ways . Still there is a call to persevere . There is a call to continue . <p> There are warnings ( such as we find in Galatians 5:2-6 ) not to fall away . Only those who persevere to the end and continue in the faith will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously and continue to trust in God 's grace until the final day and not to presume upon His grace by thinking we can do whatever we wish and still obtain the final inheritance . We must be very careful though that we do not make this primary , so that God 's grace in saving us and choosing us and sanctifying us and justifying us is removed and the focus becomes on our good works . Our good works are the response to God 's grace , the evidence of God 's grace . And yet on the other hand , we must not diminish the call to persevere and to believe and to continue until the end . <p> Our next lecture we will look at more of what Paul says about the Christian life . 
@@35723328 @4723328/ <h> Liberalism , Neo-orthodoxy , Evangelicalism <p> These are such important movements for us to have a handle on in understanding the current state of theological discussion of what has led to where we are today as evangelicals and in the world around us as well . <h> A. Liberalism <h> 1 . Background <p> It would helpful if you had both some philosophical background as well as theological background . <p> Philosophically , as you probably know , the age of the enlightenment was a mega-shift in the way intellectuals viewed the whole process of acquiring and analyzing knowledge . Rene Descartes lived from 1596-1650 and was a very important figure in reshaping the way people conceived of the certainty of knowledge that we have . Descartes ( in one of the great ironies of intellectual history ) , in an attempt to arrive at certainty , proposed this procedure of utilizing methodological doubt . Doubt anything that can be doubted . He used examples of why we should do this . When you put a stick into water , it has the appearance of being bent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not bent ; it is straight . You ca n't trust your senses . You ca n't trust authority . You all have had experiences , I am sure , in which you have been told something you thought was reliable , and you 've come to find out that what you learned was not true . It is possible that people are wrong when they tell you things ; it is possible that your senses deceive you . So you engage in methodological doubt . Descartes took this very seriously and took it as far as he could , all the way to the point of doubting everything except the fact that there was something doubting . There was something there that was doubting . So he came up with his famous phrase ( I 'm sure some of you remember it from philosophy days ) , ' ' Cogito ergo sum ' ' , I think therefore I am . That is the one thing he said we can have certainty on . Descartes ' purpose was to break down to the bare minimum of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge based upon that . <p> The problem with his method is that nobody really followed him in terms of the building up part of it . They followed him on the tearing down part , that is , the uncertainty of everything that we thought was so sure . And people were not confident that you could build from the mere ego , the " I " or that you could know anything for certain in life . Descartes based his building up on this notion that God would n't deceive us , and people recognized that . Descartes , rather than leaving a legacy of certainty , which he was trying to do , left a legacy of doubt . This is one of the great legacies of the early enlightenment period . <p> David Hume ( 1711-1776 ) followed a very different track . Descartes was a rationalist . All of this was approached through reason , as he is thinking about these things . David Hume was a radical empiricist . As an empiricist , David Hume followed the notion that we should only accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , from empirical observation . That lead David Hume to say that there is nothing we can know with certainty from empirical observation . Not even something like a billiard table , with a ball hitting another ball that goes into the pocket . That looks pretty clear cut ; the pool stick hits the cue ball , and it hits the eight ball into the pocket . It looks like it is pretty clear that we know the cause of the ball going into the pocket . David Hume says , what does a cause look like ? How big is it ? What color is it ? How much does it weigh ? Show me a cause . So how can we know the cause of something ? It is not empirically verifiable . All we can know is a certain sequence of events . We ca n't say that one ball caused the other to go into the pocket of the billiard table . We can just say this happened , and then this happened . This was the sequencing . David Hume was a radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us this legacy of skepticism through empirical observation . So here we have these two great traditions in the enlightenment , of Rationalism and Empiricism , and both have the effect of bringing about tremendous skepticism in the culture where there used to be confidence that there could be certain knowledge <p> The philosopher who really brought all of this together , who brought a synthesis of this rationalist and empiricist tradition , was Immanuel Kant ( 1724-1804 ) . I have heard people say , and I think that it is true , that there is a sense in which the postmodernism which we are a part of now is really the logical extension of Kant 's own philosophy . There is a lot of truth to that , and if you understand Kant correctly , I think you will see this . Immanuel Kant rejected both a strict rationalist and a strict empiricist approach . In his ' ' Critique of Pure Reason ' ' ( one of the most difficult books I have ever read ; I read it my MA program in philosophy and labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Reality " ; they were equally dense , equally difficult ) , he 's arguing that there have to be certain categories in the mind in order for sense data to be understood . Here I am , looking at this room and I see various persons , at least I think I see people here ; I see colors , shapes and hear sounds . So the sense data is coming to me . Kant asks the question , how is it that an individual perceiver is able to perceive what he or she sees ; why these shapes ; why these colors ; why these sounds ; what is happening ? <p> Kant argues that there are categories in the mind that take the sense data and shape it into the perceived picture that I have in minds eye as I look out here . That does n't mean that the data out there are this way ; how could I know that ? How could I possibly know that there really are chairs in this room that are sort of a bluish-greenish color ? How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are people in this room ? All I can know is my sense experience of it as it is shaped by the categories of my mind . Kant also talked about certain mechanisms of the mind . He called them " intuitions , " like cause and effect , time and space . I do n't know if people realize how radical Kant is . For Kant there is no time and space outside the mind . There is no temporal succession of moments . Picture , for example , a boat traveling down a stream . You see it here , then you see it here , and you see it here . There is no literal space nor is there a literal time which at this moment the boat is here and at another moment there . All of that , according to Kant , is because structures of the mind and these intuitions of space and time bring this about . Causation is one of the categories of the mind that would account for how we understand the billiard table example . It is categories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hume and he has an explanation for Descartes on all of these things ; they get shaped by the mind on these . So what Kant did was separate two realms ; there is a phenomenological and the noumenonal realm . The phenomenological realm is the realm of what appears to be the case , things as they appear , and the noumenonal realm is the thing as it is in itself . According to Kant , these are two totally different realms divided so that we can not know the thing in itself ; the thing as it is itself we can not know that ; that is the noumenonal realm . What we know is our phenomenological experience . What we know is what we see and hear . When asked the question ( catch this point because this shows how postmodernism has carried Kant forward and yet adapted Kant in a very strategic way ) , if my mind shaped these things into the actual picture that I see , why is it two people or three people or ten people or a hundred people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They can all agree that yes we are looking at a tree ; back behind it is a blue sky ; there is a bird in the tree ; we can all agree on what we are looking at , so how can that be ? Kant 's answer to that is the uniformity of the human mind . Because we are human , we have the same categories . These categories work in the same ways among human beings . It is not that there really is a tree out there ; at least we ca n't know that . It is not that there really is a bird in that tree or there really is a blue sky ; we ca n't know any of that . But we can know that we have all had the same experience of that and that is accounted for because of the commonality of the human mind . <p> Just a footnote in terms of where this goes with postmodernism . The behavioral sciences at this particular point in Kant 's time were just in the seminal stages . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds by our upbringing , by environment , and by cultural differences ; all these things shape the way we see things . So , all of a sudden , Kant 's notion that we all have a common human way of perceiving the world is rejected instead for the notion that we have quite distinct ways of seeing the world . In fact , they may be so distinct that they are individual , but at least they are cultural at one level ; in another culture they may see things in different ways . The heritage of Kant moves forward , but it just makes it even more radical , insofar as we are bound ; we are locked into our cultural or even individual ways of interpreting the world and perceiving the sense experiences that we have . <p> Kant , in particular , is very important to the background of theological liberalism because Friedrich Schleiermacher , who is considered the father of modern liberalism , was very influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant . Schleiermacher applied this distinction , this phenomenological and noumenonal distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enlightenment had major influences on biblical and theological studies as well . There was no longer a respect for the authority of the church or the authority of the Bible . The legacy of the enlightenment is a legacy of skepticism regarding anything that had been accepted in the past as true . Something like the Copernican revolution , insofar as we used to think back in the good old days that the sun rose and went around the earth , but now we know better ; we know that we ca n't trust what we see , even though the sun rises in the east and sets in the west ; it is n't really . It looks that way , but it is n't really what is happening . The earth is rotating on its axis , and as it rotates it gives the perception that the sun is moving across the sky . So we ca n't really trust what have been told in the past ; we ca n't trust what we see ; we ca n't trust Church authority ; we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our own perceptions . <p> There is a sense in which we move from an age of revelation , whether through the Church or through Bible , to an age of reason . This reason is a chastened reason , according to these enlightenment figures , particularly Kant . A chastened reason , is a reason that has to realize its own confines in doing what it does . All we 've got is reason . We move from revelation to reason as the source of authority . Therefore , when we come to the study of the Bible , there is no longer , according to these people , the right to assume that the Bible is historical , truthful , or revelatory ; instead we treat it like any other book or set of books . We treat it like any other set of historical documents and subject it to critical scrutiny . These are all cultural by-products . Hence , the whole rise of higher criticism as it relates to the Bible came out of this enlightenment skepticism , this enlightenment view that we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at it through other lenses . In this case , subject it to the canons of reason and see whether it is accurate or not . We will have to decide that as we look . <p> Class Questions <p> What lead to this enlightenment way of thinking ? I think part of it was that in the Reformation period there was a challenge to Church authority . Here comes Martin Luther and John Calvin and the magisterial reformers who say that you ca n't necessarily trust what the Church has said . Their interest was to go back to the Bible , but what happened in the next century was more questioning along those lines . Can we believe what others say ? Can we believe what our senses tell us ? So someone like Descartes is in this period where questioning is taking place , so what he wants to do is establish certainty . Descartes ' methodology and outcome is one of the great ironies of intellectual history . Because here was Descartes , a very devoted Catholic who wanted to bring an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the legacy he left , instead , was this legacy of doubt and skepticism . I think you can say that Descartes is probably the key figure who made this mega-shift possible . Although , I think the more influential figure carrying forth to postmodernism is Kant , in how he utilized both of these traditions . <p> The noumenonal realm does exist . Otherwise we would n't have sensory experiences . It is just that we ca n't say anything about it other than it is . We ca n't say anything about the empirical world . We can say what we receive it to be phenomenologically what it looks like to us but we can not make truth claims about what it is in itself . We ca n't do that . But he was duelist , insofar as there is a real world apart from the eye , apart from the person with the senses , and then there is the person who is observing this world . Kant in his " Critique of Practical Reason " talked in terms of ethics and presupposes that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human experience . There is accountability and there is freedom of choice and this sort of thing . I think Kant , when pressed , would give a creationist answer to that . This is by design , these pre-Darwinian people were not thinking yet in terms of some kind of naturalistic evolutionary theory ; that comes later . <h> 2 . Some Key Figures <h> a . Friedrich Schleiermacher ( 1768-1834 ) <p> Almost anyone writing on the history of liberalism will credit this individual as Liberalism 's father or the one who really began the Liberal tradition . Schleiermacher rejected what he viewed as speculative natural theology , that is ( the kind of thing Thomas Aquinas is famous for doing ) , that is we can reason from this empirical world to a God who created . We can know things about God by looking at the empirical world . Thomas had " Five Ways , " for example , he constructed arguments for the existence of God and certain limited number of attributes of God such as wisdom , and power perhaps . Schleiermacher viewed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals to conduct . He also had a critical view of Scripture . His own view that he adopted of the Bible was following the line of critical scholarship that rejected it as authoritative revelation . Instead , the Bible is dear and very precious religious writings from a particular religious history which happened to be Jewish and Christian . The big move that Schleiermacher made was evoking of cause distinction between the phenomenal and noumenonal realm in saying that this applies to religion as well . So we can not know the thing itself ; we can not know the noumenonal realm ; we ca n't know God in himself . It is impossible . How could we get at this ? How could we possibly know God in himself ? Impossible . All we can know is God as he appears to us , God as we experience him . So in Schleiermacher you have this movement ( Now catch this ; this is critical . This debate goes on today in Southern Baptist circles , I guarantee you ) . Do we understand the knowledge of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Schleiermacher says no , you ca n't have that ) or is it subjective understanding that is simply a part of our experience ? Is knowledge of God objective fundamentally or subjective fundamentally ? The whole classical tradition in theology has said we know God in himself because he has revealed himself ; whether it is in nature or in the Bible , God has revealed himself so there is objective revelation of God by which we know God . No one claimed to know God perfectly or to know God comprehensively ; no one ever claimed that . What they did claim was that some true knowledge of God , in himself , could be known . It was objectively available because revelation was available . Schleiermacher rejects revelation , has a higher critical view of the Bible , and more importantly , has this Kantian distinction . All we can know is the phenomenological experience of God . Schleiermacher defines religion , then , as our feeling of absolute dependence . It is a very famous phrase in Schleiermacher , " Our feeling of absolute dependence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective , experiential . This is what true religion is . It what we feel ; what we experience about God not some kind of supposed objective truth claims about God . <p> True orthodox Christianity has always held that acquiring true objective knowledge of God must lead , if it really is acquired , if it really is embraced , to genuine experience with God . Look at Jonathan Edwards as a supreme example of that with his book , ' ' Religious Affections ' ' . So it is not as though anybody in orthodoxy was wanting to argue for a kind of objectivity of revelation and intellectual knowledge void of feeling and experience . But the feeling and experience must be based upon objective revelation that is given by God . So here comes Schleiermacher and says we ca n't have that . There is no revelation ; we ca n't know God in himself . We can know that there is a God , in all likelihood , but there ca n't be certainty about this . What we can know is our experience of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective takes the place over objective , in which imminentalism ( God in my experience ) takes the place of transcendentalism ( a fundamentally transcendental view of God , in which he is above and beyond and other than and separate from the universe ) . Now , God is in my experience and there is a personal authoritative basis for theology rather than an external authoritative basis for theology . Whether it is in the Catholic tradition or the Protestant tradition , there was something external that was pointed to , but now it is my experiences , my feelings that are authoritative . <h> b . Albrecht Ritschl ( 1822-1889 ) <p> For Ritschl , Jesus was the supreme embodiment of God 's consciousness and dependence . Right away you can see how he takes from Schleiermacher this notion of feeling of absolute dependence . What marks Jesus as being particularly significant , noteworthy , an example to follow ? We call ourselves Christians . We want to live our lives like Christ . We want to follow Christ . In Jesus Christ of Nazareth , you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness . He did it better than anyone else . Jesus , while being threatened by hostile forces , trusted God 's power and love in his life . As such , Jesus is the archetypal man ; this is how Ritschl thought of him . He is the archetypal man ; he is the epitome of what humanity is meant to be . In terms of studying the life of Jesus , there was a need , then , to discover or to get at this archetypal person , to get at exactly who he was , as clearly as possible . When that was done ; when this clear , critical , historical study was done , we would find in the end that he was this archetypal man . So claims to deity , and claims to the miraculous were stripped away . Some of you who know the work of Rudolf Bultmann can see the extension of this in his demythologizing program . Bultmann was a very consistent liberal with existential overtones . Here you have in Bultmann an extension of ritual where you get at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you get rid of the husk and you keep the kernel . All of this comes out of this liberal tradition . <p> When you did that and got to the archetypal man , Ritschl argued that what you find most prominently at the center is the moral Jesus , the ethical Jesus , the Jesus who loved others , cared for the poor , and reached out to the needy . This moral Jesus is the archetypal man who we are to follow . <h> c . Adolf von Harnack ( 1851-1930 ) <p> Harnack was raised in the home of an orthodox Lutheran scholar and was himself greatly influenced by Ritschlian liberalism , the liberalism that came through Schleiermacher and then Ritschl . He became trained in that . Von Harnack came to see orthodox doctrine as wrongly preoccupied with specific doctrinal teachings and standards of belief , rather than getting at the thrust of what Scripture was trying to get at : to teach us a way of life . So do n't get bogged down with orthodox doctrine that misses the point . The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is show us a way of life which he described as " the way of the kingdom , " or , " kingdom life . " We have a moral responsibility to live out the ethic of the kingdom , according to von Harnack . He argued that as we read the Bible we have to separate out the husk . If you think of a grain of wheat , we need to separate the chaff or the husk and blow it away to keep the kernel . For him , the kernel was the ethical core of the Bible 's teachings , the kingdom message of light that shines in darkness , the message of God 's goodness that comes to dispel evil . He said that if we understand that , then we will see much more clearly . If we could enter into this mind set that we are in the kingdom , then we could see the fatherhood of God , and the brotherhood of man lived out among us . <p> Liberalism , among other things , was very optimistic about human well-being . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deity of Christ , what else went in the process ? Well , total depravity , sin , and the imputation of Adam 's sin is gone too . So we have a fundamentally good humanity that just needs to realize its own inherent goodness and enter into that kingdom of life under the fatherhood of God , expressing the brotherhood of man , and we will enter a utopian society . There is very strong optimism that this liberal gospel message of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man would have the effect of bringing in the kingdom , that is , a utopian society on earth . <h> B. Neo-Orthodoxy <h> 1 . Background <p> Neo-Orthodoxy stands as a deliberate rejection of 19th century and early 20th century liberalism , in the religious and moral crisis associated with World War I. Think about how liberalism rejects sin , and rejects depravity . Well all of that sounded good . There were utopian societies that were forming in the late 19th century and early 20th century . There was a tremendous optimism . By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn of the 19th and 20th century . Postmillennialism swept orthodox Christianity in the west . It was just a cultural climate of optimism ; the kingdom is going to come , whether it is the Schleiermacherian kingdom or the kingdom of God as people are saved and the world is Christianized . There was this tremendous optimism . Then all of a sudden World War I hit and it was tremendously sobering as people realized with greater technology comes even more devastating cruelty and harm and devastation that could happen to human well-being . So World War I really did provide a tremendous reason for reevaluating the optimism of liberalism . <p> ( It also meant postmillennialists by and large shifted to amillennialism . The majority in the Reformed tradition in the 20th century from World War I on have been amillennial rather than postmillennial . Postmillennialism has been a minority view until just recent years when it has had resurgence. ) <h> 2 . Some Key Figures <h> a . Karl Barth ( 1886-1968 ) <p> Karl Barth was trained in classical liberalism . He studied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . But for Barth , as he began to write his Romans commentary ( he actually writes in there ) he came to terms with the bankruptcy of liberalism and the truth of God 's word in Romans that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ( Rom 3:23 ) , that there is fundamental depravity of the human heart . He came to terms with this and he talks about publishing his Romans commentary , rejecting liberalism , and upholding this new orthodoxy , hence Neo-Orthodoxy . It was , as he said , as though he was groping for a rope to hang onto as he was writing Romans . He found the rope and when he pulled on it , he did n't realize that at the top of the rope was a bell that sounded and a whole countryside was awakened . There is a lot of truth to that . Barth 's commentary on Romans was , in fact , an awakening to a whole community of liberals who were dissatisfied with liberalism and shifted over to Neo-Orthodoxy . Barth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could not know God . He reinvested theology with the concept of revelation . Now , granted , his view of revelation is deficient . All of us as evangelicals recognized that his view of revelation erred in a number of ways , but do n't miss the point ; revelation is back with Barth . This is a huge shift out of liberalism , to hold a view that a transcendent God is holy other ( One of Barth 's best parts of ' ' Church Dogmatics ' ' is where he describes the doctrine of God . It is just marvelous . Honestly , I have been led to tears reading Karl Barth 's discussion of God . It is so moving and so much of it is right on track . ) He has this very high view of God , a lofty view of a self-existent , self-sufficient , all perfect , supreme holy God who creates a world and reveals himself to this world . Now the revelation , for Barth , is most prominently in the person of Jesus . Christ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to that revelation . This is where his view begins to break down in terms of what evangelicals would accept . The Bible is a witness to revelation . Not that the Bible is itself revelation . He was reluctant to talk in those terms . He was reluctant to say the Bible is the Word of God . He would rather say that the Bible witnesses to the Word of God , who is Christ ; or the Bible becomes the Word of God as God speaks to us through it of Christ . Do you hear both of those ? He is happy with both of those . The Bible witnesses to the Word of God , Christ ; or the Bible becomes the Word of God as God uses it to witness in our hearts to help us understand the Word of God , Christ . But he was not inclined to talk about the Bible as the Word of God . But nonetheless , revelation is here ; we have a transcendent God again , a holy other God who makes himself known . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Barth . Now again , there are problems because in Christ , according to Barth , God 's " yes " is greater than man 's " no . " And most interpreters of Barth , myself included , have argued that in Barth 's view universalism is entailed , even though he never does explicitly say so . I can show you passages in Barth where , if you take seriously what he is saying , it looks clear that this must mean universal salvation of all people ultimately . The gospel really becomes for Barth going and announcing to people that they have been saved , so live like it . Live like the saved people that you are , is the message according to Barth . <p> So Barth rejected liberalism and brought in this new kind of orthodoxy , deficient in many ways , but nonetheless , I would say on balance closer to us than to liberalism . The reason I say that is , think of the gulf between revelation or not . That is huge . If you go down this track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have revelation , what do have ? What does Schleiermacher have ? My feelings , my thoughts , subjectivity altogether . Your subjectivity is yours , and mine is mine . There can be no normative truth in this . But if God has spoken then we are talking about the possibility of normative truth about God , and Barth holds to that . Where he differs , in numbers of ways , is very problematic . But he made a huge shift from the liberalism from which he was a part . <h> b . Emil Brunner ( 1889-1966 ) <p> Like Barth , Brunner affirms the self-disclosure of God as the only basis for theology . In the self-disclosure or self-revelation of God , God makes himself known . Brunner 's distinctive emphasis , as it relates to revelation , differed from Barth on the notion that revelation ought to understood as a personal encounter . He is sometimes called " the crisis theologian " of the Neo-Orthodox movement . Revelation must be a personal encounter . So as we read the Bible , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of God through the witness of Scripture . Brunner rejected a literal portrayal of Jesus as strictly a human being and insisted that Jesus was at once true God and true man ( so did Barth by the way ) . Barth and Brunner both rejected the critical view of Jesus . Not that they rejected all of criticism ; they did n't . They accepted quite a bit of critical theory , but they rejected the notion that Jesus , rightly understood , is just a man and not God . They held , rather , that he is both God and man . The one area of greatest disagreement between the two actually might strike us a being a rather trivial area . Brunner argued for natural theology , that you could come to know God through looking at nature ; and Barth , in response to that , wrote a little booklet in German whose title was " Nein . " No . That is an interesting way to oppose a friend because they were friends until that point , and then they separated and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their adult lives . Barth was very opposed to the notion of natural theology , believing that only as one entered into faith could one then perceive the world correctly . According to him , one could not argue to an unbeliever , one outside of faith , from the world to God . That is impossible ; you have to be in the faith in order to believe in God . So they had that major disagreement . <h> c . Reinhold Niebuhr ( 1892-1971 ) <p> Niebuhr was strongly influenced in his early years by social gospel liberalism : do good to others . This is what the gospel is : go and share the good of the kingdom , and they too will share in kind . Throughout his life he was intensely interested with the application of the Christian faith . He really wanted to see how this worked in practice . He became convinced that the liberal gospel was a sham because it was founded upon an altogether false anthropology . It was founded upon a false view of the fundamental goodness of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people as sinners , as desperately wicked people who needed to be changed by God . So humanity is in this paradoxical state as created by God , good but desperately wicked as sinners . Or believers are in this paradoxical state desperately wicked as sinners but now as saints called into the kingdom of God . So he argued that there had to be this paradoxical understanding of human beings and not a uniform understanding . Humans are not all bad and not all good . Neither one of those would do full justice to who we are . <h> C. Evangelicalism <h> 1 . Background <p> 20th century evangelicalism ( actually the second half of the 20th century ) or the evangelical movement is marked by perhaps the founding of Fuller Seminary or Christianity Today or Carl Henry 's little book , ' ' The Uneasy Conscious of Modern Fundamentalism ' ' , which is from the late forties . So evangelicalism as we know it is a second half of the 20th century movement . <p> What was before that ? Before that it was Fundamentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who share in common , with later evangelicals , all of the fundamentals of the faith . The virgin birth of Christ , the deity of Christ , the substitutionary atonement , the doctrine of the trinity , the depravity of human beings , the necessity of faith in Christ and all of these fundamentals of the faith are held in common between fundamentalism and evangelicalism . So what marks them as fundamentalist and us over here as evangelicals ? A couple of things . One is the early fundamentalists in the early 20th century were standing against modernists . The controversy was fundamentalist with modernists , or liberals if you want to think of them as liberals , standing against them . The cultural forces were definitely favoring modernism . This was at a time when Darwinian evolution , for example , had become not totally accepted by the culture at large , but the intellectual elite had accepted Darwinian evolution as a fact . So here are these fundamentalists over here arguing for six day creation . And the intellectuals , among the modernists in the culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old view that is archaic and ought to be discarded . <p> One of the pivotal events ( you can mark a shift that happens in fundamentalism ) is the Scopes trial . William Jennings Bryan was the defender of the state of Tennessee . Clarence Darrell came down from Chicago to defend this teacher , Scope , who had been teaching evolution . So they took this to trial and actually William Jennings Bryan won the trial , but he lost the culture war because in the process Clarence Darrell put William Jennings Bryan on the witness stand . Come to find out , he not only did n't know much about contemporary evolutionary theory ( the science that was involved in that ) , but then he started asking him questions about the Bible and he did n't know much about the Bible either . At least his answers were very unsatisfying . So it looked to most people that William Jennings Bryan , who had run for President and was a highly respected individual , was not the intellectual icon they thought he was . So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating at the Scopes trial . Fundamentalism , prior to Scopes trial in 1925 , had been engaged in a fundamentalist/modernist controversy . People like J Gresham Machen and B. B. Warfield were intent on engaging modernist arguments and trying to answer them . Look sometime at J. Gresham Machen 's thick book ( it is almost 400 pages long , if I remember correctly ) on the virgin birth of Christ . Can you imagine writing a 400 page book on the virgin birth of Christ ? Do you know what this book is ? It is an intense exegetical , theological defense of this doctrine in light of this modernist attack . That is fundamentalism up until 1925 . Now they are beat . <p> What do fundamentalists do ? They say , you know we are probably not going to win this culture war with modernism , so what we are going to do is separate from them . We are going to take our own home with us ; we are going to set up our own schools , and train our own kids so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected with liberalism . So the Bible school movement flourished in the late 20 's , the 30 's , 40 's and 50 's . Furthermore , we are going to insulate ourselves as much as possible from this liberal culture that we are a part of . The only exception to that was a kind of witnessing ; you can even hear it in the phraseology used . " We are going to go and save souls . " I find nothing wrong with that in principle ; we do need to save souls . But what was point here ? The liberals were the ones who were interested in physical ministry to people . The liberals had the social gospel where you do kind deeds to others and that sort of thing . " We do n't want to be liberals , " said the fundamentalists , " So we do n't want to be involved in social activism ; we are interested in spiritual needs , not social or physical needs . " What I am giving you is a generalization ; not all fundamentalists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , rescue missions continued in this time . There were efforts made by Christian people , but as a movement , on the whole , there was this isolationism that took place . In that context here comes a Carl Henry , and he says , you know what we have really blown it here . We 've got to change . That 's what began evangelicalism. <h> 2 . Some Key Figures <h> a . Edward John Carnell ( 1919-1967 ) <p> Carnell is most noted for his strong intellectual critique of modernism and liberalism as an evangelical . He believed post 1925 fundamentalists made a huge mistake by leaving the marketplace of ideas , leaving the universities , and leaving the intellectual climate of the culture . He insisted on entering it again . He did two doctorates ; the first he got at Harvard University where he did his dissertation on Reinhold Niebuhr . He did a second doctorate at Boston University under E. S. Brightman . He wanted to show that he could master everything liberalism had to offer and answer it . Carnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable to look at . He had a very sad ending to his life . He taught at Fuller Seminary and his light was on late at night ( of course that was not unusual as he often there very late ) , and they went and discovered that he had overdosed on some prescription drugs ; it was n't illegal drugs , but prescription drugs . They do n't know if this was suicide or accidental , but he came to a rather early end of life . <h> b . Carl F. H. Henry ( 1913- 2003 ) <p> What an amazing man . He was a man who had a tremendous influence on our president here . Dr Mohler has shared his story many times in context where Carl Henry was the one , who humanly speaking , the Lord used to turn him around , that is turn Dr Mohler around . When he was here at Southern , he was the assistant to the president , Dr. Honeycut and was assisting the moderate cause in the Southern Baptist Convention . He wrote a paper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assistant to the president . Who would ever guess that that was the case ? But Carl Henry was the one whom the Lord used to help him start thinking in ways about Scripture that he had n't , and it just opened up this whole world of careful biblical understanding which turned him around . Carl Henry , I think , could be called the dean of contemporary American Evangelicalism that began at the very end of the first half of the 20th century . In 1947 he wrote a little book , 75 pages , called ' ' The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism ' ' . In this book he argued two things primarily . Number one was that fundamentalism was dead wrong to abandon the intellectual fight with liberalism , and he wanted to re-engage the fundamentalist movement ( that now would be called evangelical movement ) and make a case for the claims of the gospel and the truths of the Bible . He encouraged people , like Carnell had done , to learn what liberals had to teach and then show them what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a very strong apologetic and evangelistic interest in this . Re-engage with the intellectual culture . <p> The second thing that he said fundamentalism erred on horribly was to distinguish spiritual well-being ( preach the gospel and save souls ) from physical social well-being . In fact God calls us to minister to whole people , and we ca n't do this by not being involved in social work . He was also very clear that social work can not in itself be the gospel . He was n't calling for people to come to social gospel liberalism and that all . He agreed with Jesus ; what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul ? ( Mark 8:36 ) . Social work had to be coupled with spiritual teaching and conviction of heart in order for people to receive the full ministry of God 's grace in their lives . Well that book had an enormous impact . Billy Graham , among others , read it and encouraged Carl Henry to become the founding editor of ' ' Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . CT , which is still in existence today , has perhaps shifted a bit from its earlier mission and vision , but it is , nonetheless , still in existence . It was founded by Billy Graham and H. Nelson Bell who was his father-in-law . So Ruth Graham Bell 's dad and Billy Graham founded Christianity Today and Carl Henry was the first editor . Carl Henry has also been very involved with World Vision , a relief organization , because of his interest in bringing together social work combined with gospel proclamation . <h> c . Billy Graham ( 1918- ) <p> He is still living , and he is able to do remarkably well at his age . Billy Graham is failing a bit , but praise the Lord he is still with us . Billy Graham went to Wheaton College and after his ordination as a Southern Baptist he became , in 1943 , the first evangelist of this newly founded organization , Youth For Christ . His 1948 Los Angeles crusade is what brought him national fame . From that point the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelist preaching the gospel , but he has also been very involved in holistic ministry to people . You probably know of all the ways he has been involved in relief work and social work , as well as the crusades that they do , the gospel proclamation . There is a sense in which if you put Henry and Graham together you really get the heart of evangelicalism . Because what you have is an aggressive interest in the truth of the gospel , defending the truth , and knowing the truth ; and you have an aggressive interest in sharing the gospel with others . Both are interested in both . It is not that Henry is the mind and Graham is the heart or one is the theologian and the other is the evangelist . They both are interested in both . It is really wonderful to see how that has been , although each has their own specialty and area of expertise .

On the one hand , many ancient cultures possessed stories describing how the gods made the universe in some crude fashion . The Babylonian epic of creation describes how the god Marduk slays the rebel Tiamat , and then fillets her body like that of a fish , using one half to make the sky and the other half to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biblical accounts of creation and these pagan stories , it is abundantly clear that the former are remarkably free from the mythological elements and sheer fantasy found in the culture of Israel 's neighbors , and are altogether on a loftier , monotheistic level of thought . <p> On the other hand , we have the kind of explanation of the origins of the universe found in a modern textbook of scientific cosmology . The Bible makes no attempt to give an account of this kind , and it would have been impossible for it to do so . A typical modern book on cosmology outlines several competing theories on the subject and expresses them in a mathematical form that is beyond the ordinary reader 's comprehension . Had the Bible attempted to provide a scientific cosmology it would doubtless have been equally beyond the understanding of the ordinary person . <p> Instead , the biblical account gives us a poetic description of the fact that God created the universe ; it lists what can be seen in the world and asserts that everything owes its origin to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and indeed it is doubtful whether the act of creation could be described in words . <p> It is a misunderstanding of the account in Genesis 1 to see it as a scientific account of what happened . Hence the alleged conflicts between the biblical account and modern scientific accounts of creation are merely apparent . The two types of accounts are doing two different , complementary tasks . Scientists are interested in the " what " and " how " of the universe ; they want to describe it accurately and explain the laws that governed its development . The Bible is interested in the " why " of the universe , with the questions of its ultimate origin , final destiny , and moral significance . These are two different questions , and attempts to answer them need not produce any conflict , so long as theologians and scientists do not make illegitimate attempts to answer each other 's questions . It is true that there is a certain " no man 's land " between science and theology , where real problems can arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians suggests that these problems are capable of a coherent Christian solution . <p> The purpose of the biblical account of creation is , then , to teach that the universe is not self " existent but owes its origin to God . Pagan myths , such as the Babylonian one quoted above , suggest that the gods created the universe out of some previously existing " stuff , " just as a potter imposes an intelligible form on a shapeless lump of clay . By contrast the Bible asserts emphatically that God created the universe out of nothing ( ex nihilo ) . He created the materials as well as molded them to shape ( Hebrews 11:3 ) . We may even suggest that space and time are his creation , although since we can not think without making use of the framework of space and time it is impossible for us to imagine what the creation of these might mean . <p> The biblical doctrine of creation rules out the view " which is still often found " that God is to be wholly or partly identified with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no support in the Bible , which emphasizes that the universe is merely the creature made by God . God is far greater than the universe that he created and over which he rules . No matter how great the universe may be , he inhabits eternity and the earth is like a mere footstool to him ( Isaiah 57:15 ; 66:1 ) . This is why the Bible is so vehemently opposed to idolatry , which is the worship of the creation , or part of the creation , rather than the Creator ( Romans 1:25 ) . In modern times some astronauts have commented that they did not see God in the course of their explorations , and one might be tempted to draw the foolish conclusion that there is no God . Such a view fails to recognize the transcendence ' of God as the One who is greater than the universe and whose existence is not bound by our categories of space and time . <p> The popular view of creation posits an act of God at some point in the remote past that brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it going like a clock to carry on ticking under its own power without any further attention . This view is open to criticism on three accounts . It makes God into a kind of absentee landlord who has left his universe to its own devices and no longer exercises any control over it ; this is the error known as deism , which flourished in the eighteenth century . It also fails to take into account the possibility of the continual replenishment of the universe with fresh supplies of matter " the so-called " continuous creation " of matter , postulated by some cosmologists . Further , it ignores the continuous creation of new forms of inanimate and animate nature that surround us at every turn . The question , " Who made this beautiful scene ? " is not completely answered by speaking about God 's original act of creation : we need to refer to the action of wind and water over centuries , to the planting or removal of vegetation by human agencies , and so on . Similarly , when a child asks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of creation by God that was responsible but the coming together of his parents in a creative union . It follows that our doctrine of creation must preserve the insight that God continues to create the universe in and through such natural acts . He exercises continual care and control over the universe ; and if he did not do so , it would cease to exist ( cf. Colossians 1:17 ) . <p> When we turn to the New Testament we find that Jesus Christ is closely linked with God the Father in the work of creation . He is clearly the central agent in the new creation , which is the theme of the New Testament , but he was also involved in the original creation of the universe ( Hebrews 1:1 " 3 ) . A careful distinction is made between the roles of the three Persons of the Trinity . God the Father is the ultimate author of creation . His Son is the agent by whom the world was created , and he is said to be the one for whom it exists ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the creation ( Genesis 1:2 ) . Thus , as we might expect , the whole Trinity is involved in the work of creation . <h> God the Lord ( Psalm 107:148 ) <p> If God created the universe , he must be greater than it . It is not surprising , therefore , that he is spoken of as the Lord or Sovereign of all that he has created . This relationship is expressed by the three " omni " " words which bring out the supreme authority of God over the whole of creation . <p> God is omnipotent or all " powerful . He is able to do what he wishes to do ( cf. Isaiah 40:21 " 31 ) . Of course , it does not mean that he is able to do things which are self " contradictory or absurd . People have sometimes poured scorn on the Christian belief in the omnipotence of God by asking , " Can God create a stone so heavy that even he can not lift it ? " We need not waste our time over logical puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder at the power by which God the Son was able to become part of his own creation when he was incarnate as a man . From the point of view of logic this too is an impossibility , but our inability to comprehend how it is possible reflects the finiteness of our human understanding . A much more important problem in relation to God 's sovereignty is the existence of evil in the world ( see the last section of this chapter ) . <p> God is omniscient or all " knowing . He fully knows and understands the universe which he has created . Nothing that happens in it is hidden from his sight ( cf. Romans 11:33 " 36 ; Colossians 2:3 ) . Here again we have a concept which transcends what our minds can conceive . It is not possible for us to imagine a situation in which we know everything , including all that we ourselves are going to do . The Bible speaks of God 's fore " ordaining of what is going to happen in the future , so that history proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foretell certain aspects of what is going to happen . Such fore " ordination necessarily includes what God himself is going to do in the future . But as soon as we try to think of what is implied in a free agent fore " ordaining what he himself is going to do in the future , we find that we involve ourselves in a logical tangle from which there is no escape . Omniscience is an attribute of God which we can confess , but can not understand . This is why the concept of predestination , which has played so important a part in Protestant theology , must be handled with the greatest care . To speak of God 's omniscience and predestination is to speak of a mystery , which lies beyond human comprehension , and from which we can easily draw false conclusions . Rather we use these words to confess the greatness of the God to whom we can commit our future in entire confidence that he will work all things for our good ( Romans 8:28 ) . <p> God is omnipresent or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be misunderstood and can be the cause of problems . We are obviously not to think of God as being like some kind of rarefied gas or wireless waves filling all space . Rather the point is that no part of the universe is closed from God and his activity . Jacob found that he could not escape from the watchful eye of God by running away from home ( Genesis 28:10ff. , especially verse 16 ) , and a psalmist affirmed that it is impossible to flee from God by day or by night , in life or in death ( Psalm 139 ) . People may find God and commune with him anywhere and at any time ( Matthew 28:20 ) . The doctrine of omnipresence is thus an expression of the fact that God is always there to help his people with sovereign power . Nevertheless , it is possible to speak of people shutting themselves off from the presence of God by their sin , and we sometimes talk as though there were degrees of God 's presence : the saying of Jesus about his being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew 18:20 ) suggests that he is present in a special way in groups of Christians , although we would not want to deny that he can be fully present with the individual Christian . The term " presence " is somewhat open " textured and can have a somewhat different force in different contexts . <p> The effect of speaking of God in terms of these three rather abstract concepts is thus to bring out the greatness and wisdom of his care for his people , which is available to them at all times and everywhere . This care of God for the universe and its inhabitants has traditionally found expression in the term providence ( literally , " foresight " ) . The biblical writers ascribe the round of the seasons , the provision of rain and sunshine , and all that enables people to live in security , to God 's gracious care for the world . This care is related to the behaviour of God 's people . The Old Testament story shows that when Israel was righteous she enjoyed prosperity on the material level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God to provide for her , disaster followed ( Genesis 1:29f. ; 8:22 ; Deuteronomy 28 ; Psalm 104 ; Matthew 6:25 " 34 ; 10:29 " 31 ) . <p> It must be admitted that there is not an exact correspondence between human behaviour and divine provision for human needs . We can not trace connections between human piety and material prosperity and between human sin and natural disasters in the way the Old Testament prophets did ; lacking their prophetic insight , it would be quite wrong for us to say that some particular natural disaster was due to some particular sinful act on the part of humans . The biblical writers themselves were very conscious of the problem that the wicked often seem to prosper at the expense of the righteous and were driven to the conclusion that the problem can be solved only when what happens after death is taken into consideration ( Psalm 49:73 ) . It is here that the character of religious faith as faith is relevant . Faith is not , as the schoolboy definition once put it , " believing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , believing despite considerable obstacles that something is true . The appearances are often against Christian belief , and we are tempted to an interpretation of the universe which sees only its outward character of confusion ; faith is the daring act by which , in virtue of such stubborn facts as the life , death , and resurrection of Jesus , we are not content with mere appearances but believe that behind the universe there stands the figure of a loving and all " powerful God . The Christian belief is that , no matter how great be the tribulations of the person who trusts in God , nevertheless God knows their situation , cares for them in the midst of it , and will eventually bring them safely through . <h> The Nature of Mankind ( Psalm 8 ) <p> Humans are the climax and crown of God 's creation , for , unlike other creatures , they are the image of God ( Genesis 1:26f . ) . This phrase means that they are like God and in some way are God 's representatives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are able to control their environment and create new things . Above all , they possess a moral nature . Alone of created beings they are capable of moral behaviour ; they know the difference between right and wrong , between love and hatred . They are capable of fellowship with other people and with God himself . They are beings with a moral and spiritual nature that distinguishes them from the rest of creation and places them " a little lower than God , " yet firmly as creatures . <p> The Bible 's description of humans as creatures made to be God 's image is unaffected by scientific questions regarding the origin of the human race . There has been much debate among Christians about the correctness or otherwise of the theory of biological evolution , and some would argue that the theory can not be true because it contradicts the biblical account of the special creation of humans . A number of questions can easily be confused here , as with the general question of the creation of the universe . It must be insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species is a question for the scientist and can not be settled by an appeal to the Bible . The Bible is not concerned to give a scientific account of the origin of mankind , but to insist on their divine creation and their spiritual nature . There is no necessary conflict between the Bible and science , provided that we do not interpret the biblical account of creation in a literalistic manner which goes against the intention of the original writer . Again , we do well to remember that biological evolution remains a scientific hypothesis , admittedly the most generally accepted theory , but , like every scientific hypothesis , open to falsification and replacement by a better theory . Further , assertions about the spiritual nature of humans can not be falsified by appeal to their possible humble origins , any more than a pearl can be said to be worthless because it comes out of a humble oyster . In the same way a person 's worth is not to be measured by their chemical ingredients ( once valued at two dollars , but inflation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moral , and physical qualities . The trouble is that we think too exclusively of Adam as being made in God 's image ; but so too is every child born to human parents . The statement that mankind is God 's image is a statement about us all , and not merely about the first person . <p> Just as the biblical account of the origin of mankind is not meant to be a scientific statement , so too the biblical description of the nature of humans is not meant to be a scientific statement of this . It is in fact dangerous to construct a biblical " psychology , " because the same psychological terms are used by the different biblical authors with varying shades of meaning . In general , however , we can say that in the Old Testament mankind is regarded as creatures made of flesh and bones ; they are described as being living souls , and their life is inbreathed by God ( e.g. 2 Samuel 19:12f. ; Genesis 2:7 ) . In the New Testament mankind has a body composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have , or are , a soul ( psych- " ) and a spirit ( pneuma ) ( 1 Thessalonians 5:23 ) . It is an old argument whether mankind is correspondingly bipartite ( body and soul ) or tripartite ( body , soul and spirit ) . The tendency among modern scholars is to say that these three words refer to three different , but closely related , aspects of mankind ; " body " refers to them as physical beings , " soul " to them as beings who have a mental life , and " spirit " to them as beings who have a spiritual life . Rather than their having three " parts , " they can be looked at from three different points of view . Nevertheless , the term " body " appears to refer to the physical aspect of humans rather than to their whole being , and the term " soul " or " spirit " refers to their mental and spiritual aspects rather than to their whole being . <p> The chief purpose of mankind 's creation has been expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glorify God , and to enjoy him forever . " Manifestly this statement needs to be filled out , concerned as it is solely with mankind 's relation to God . But it has the merit of putting first things first by stating that a person 's life is meant to be centered on God , to be devoted to the praise of God ( both in actual words and also in its general motivation ) , and to find its supreme joy in living fellowship with God . It is the merit of John Calvin to have rediscovered this central truth , that God is at the center , and mankind is his creation . In a justly famous passage in his Reply to Sadolet he criticized the Roman Catholic theology of his day for placing too much stress on mankind and their desires for eternal blessedness , as if this should be a person 's chief interest : " it is not very sound theology to confine a man 's thoughts so much to himself , and not to set before him as the prime motive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For we are born first of all for God , and not for ourselves . " It is not too much to say that this placing of God at the center and humans in subordination to him is the fundamental insight of Calvin 's theology and of Protestant theology generally . <p> At the same time , people are made to live in community with others , the basic unit being the family , which reflects the Father-Son relationship in the Trinity ( cf. Ephesians 3:15 ) . It is virtually impossible for people to live without some kind of community " the Robinson Crusoe type of situation is highly unusual and manifestly incomplete " and it is only in community that they can fully realize their nature as humans . Indeed it could be said that " person " is a term which involves reciprocal relationships , just like " husband " or " wife . " <h> The Problem of Evil ( Genesis 3 ; Job 24 ) <p> So far we have been looking at the universe and humans in relation to their Creator without taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evil . According to the familiar biblical story , however , the creation of mankind was quickly followed by the entry of evil into their heart . They were created with the possibility of choosing between right and wrong , between obedience to God and disobedience . But they made the wrong decision at the instigation of the tempter , and sin with all its dreadful consequences entered the world ( Genesis 3 , cf. Romans 5:12 " 21 ; 2 Corinthians 11:3 ) . <p> The story of Adam and Eve 's fall is concerned only with the fact of sin 's entry into mankind . We are not told how or why evil arose . The temptation comes from the serpent who was apparently one of the creatures made by God , but we are not told how it came to have its evil nature in a world which God created " very good " . Other passages in the Old Testament push back the story of evil by suggesting some kind of disobedience among angelic beings before the creation of the world ( cf. Genesis 6:1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 19 ; Jude 6 ) , but these too do not offer us any explanation of how sin arose . <p> The problem of sin , i.e. human wrongdoing , is closely bound up with the problem of evil generally . Evil is anything that causes pain and suffering and interferes with the enjoyment of life . People suffer through a variety of causes , including their own wicked actions and those of others , but also through natural calamities , such as storms and earthquakes , deadly bacteria , and poisons . Much suffering is caused by ignorance , some but not all of which might have been avoided . The nature of humans as beings subject to decay also leads to suffering and eventually to death . There is suffering too in the animal world , although we may perhaps exaggerate its conscious extent in animals with elementary nervous systems . <p> Such suffering is obviously not in proportion to the personal wickedness of people , so that it might be regarded as due retribution for their evil ways . Indeed , it is its haphazardness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent people can bear pain when they can see a reason for it : a person is ready to suffer aching muscles and a racing heart in order to achieve some feat of physical endurance . We recognize that some pain is inevitable in the world . But there still remain the two basic problems of the existence of much pain and suffering that seems to serve no useful end , to spoil life rather than to ennoble it , and of the sheer arbitrariness of it all . " Why does it happen to me ? " is perhaps the most characteristic and pressing question asked by the sufferer . The thoughtful person may produce the even more baffling question : " If God is good and all " powerful , why can not he arrange things so as to avoid suffering and evil ? " If we reply that suffering is due to human sinfulness , this still does not explain the existence of natural calamities , nor does it deal with the objection that God could have created beings who , although possessed of freewill ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as to avoid falling into sin and suffering . <p> It is possible to advance various points which mitigate the difficulty of these questions , such as the warning value of certain experiences of pain ( e.g. toothache ) or the good effects on character produced by undergoing some painful disciplines ; but it should be emphasized that some people speak far too casually of the good effects of suffering , and forget that warning pains are warnings against worse pains , and that certain types of suffering ( such as the effects of rabies or brain damage ) can not by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as means of refining the character of the sufferers . <p> Other types of solutions may be suggested which limit either the goodness or the power of God , so that he is either unwilling or unable to deal with the problem . Such solutions ( particularly the latter one ) may lead to a dualistic view of the universe in which God is opposed by an evil power . Christians have almost universally rejected such a solution , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain which is going to win in the end and puts a large question mark against the biblical assertions of God 's sovereignty . On the other hand , it seems even more difficult to trace the origin of evil to the will of God , and the Bible categorically denies this idea ( Genesis 1:31 ; James 1:13 ; such a passage as Isaiah 45:7 simply asserts that God sends calamity upon people as a penalty for their sins ) . <p> One solution is to argue that God permits evil rather than directly wills it , but this does not solve the problem , because to speak of " permitting " is to imply that God himself would prefer that things were other than they actually are . Or , it may be argued , what appears evil and pointless to us would nevertheless appear good and purposeful could we see it from God 's angle with a fuller knowledge than we can possess as humans . Job is the classical example of the man who could not see the reason for his sufferings , although the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of the book is that , if the sufferer had known why he was suffering , his sufferings would have lost their purpose of demonstrating to Satan Job 's resolute faith in God . <p> Yet another type of solution is to argue that the problem arises because of the creation of humans as people with freewill to respond to God in love . Such freedom implies the possibility of refusal to love God and carries with it the risk of all the attendant suffering . But this solution means that God still permits the development of evil in the world , even if he does not approve of it . Nor does it solve the problem of natural calamities which can not be ascribed to the results of human rebellion against God . <p> The truth of the matter seems to be that evil is an irrational quantity in the universe , a surd which can not be either explained or explained away . The Bible does not explain its origin , and its origin can not be explained ; perhaps if it could be explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does say is , first , that God is implacably opposed to evil , so that he is not to be regarded as its origin ; second , that God is active to overcome evil and that he has demonstrated this supremely by himself submitting to its effects in the death of Jesus ; third , that God is mightier than evil , a fact which he showed in raising Jesus from the dead and which will be shown in his final victory . <p> There are difficulties in ascribing the origin of evil to God or to an independent power ; we must be content to leave its origin a mystery . Its existence continues to be the biggest objection that can be brought against the Christian belief in God . The objection , however , is far from decisive , although it must be continually assessed and answered . It can be rebutted by the Christian understanding of the cross as the event in which God has declared his opposition to sin and his involvement up to the hilt in sharing the suffering of mankind and enabling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the non-believer has an even greater problem in explaining the presence of good and beautiful things in a purely material universe . <h> The Nature and Effects of Sin ( Romans 1:18 " 2:16 ) <p> However mysterious the origin of sin , its character in the lives of people is all too obvious . We can describe it from three points of view , in relation to God , other people , and the sinner . <p> In relation to God , sin is rebellion against him . It is disobedience to his will and purpose expressed in the commandments he has given to people ( Deuteronomy 17:2 ; 1 Kings 8:50 ; Isaiah 1:2 ; 63:10 ) . The sinner is a person who misses the mark by falling short of God 's standards for human conduct ( Luke 15:18 , 21 ; Romans 3:23 ) . Instead of giving God the worship and love due to him , they offer their devotion to other gods ; in the ancient world this was expressed in idolatry , but in both the ancient and the modern worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God the object of one 's supreme concern and passion ( Exodus 20:3 " 6 ; Luke 12:13 " 21 ; 1 Corinthians 10:14-22 ) . Sin is basically a refusal to accept God as our sovereign Lord , and it often expresses itself in a perverted knowledge of him which denies his truth and love ( Romans 1:18-23 ; 2 Corinthians 4:4 ) . <p> In relation to other people , sin is seen in immorality , injustice and lack of love ( Romans 1:18-32 : 13:9f. ; 1 John 3:15 ; 4:8 ) . These words all indicate the attitude which refuses to treat other people as persons with their own rights . The sinner refuses to respect the rights of other people and disrupts the fellowship of love , which is God 's purpose for people . They treat other people as means rather than as ends , as things which they can use for their own pleasure instead of as persons who are to be helped to enjoy fullness of life . They are like children playing a game , who are determined that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat their competitors . The rules are necessary in order to indicate the rights of the competing individuals ; they are an expression of the structure of society and are designed to prevent any individual disrupting the structure and thereby spoiling life for others . <p> In relation to oneself , sin expresses itself in pride , self-sufficiency and self-centredness ( Malachi 4:1 ; Luke 1:51 ; James 4:6 ; 1 John 2:16 ) . It is the attitude of the person who not only puts themselves first , but also resents any interference from outside in the running of their life . They are unconcerned about anybody except themselves and their own pleasures , and they feel no need of the counsel or help of God in managing their own affairs . They think that they can do without God . <p> Sin thus affects every relationship of people , and its influence can be seen in every part of life ; its badness corrupts their thoughts , sayings , and deeds . The old " fashioned term for this pervasive effect of sin is " total depravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be denied that one person differs from another in degrees of goodness and evil . Even when measured by such an inadequate , external standard as the secular law , people manifestly differ considerably from one another . Nor should the existence of good deeds even in the worst of people be forgotten . The tendency of Christians is to deny that non " Christians can be good in any sense at all without the help of Christ . This is palpably false . Otherwise , all our moral comparisons between people would be nonsensical . The point is rather that none of us is free from the taint of sin ; all of us are sufferers from a disease which affects the whole of our lives to different degrees , and none of us can cure himself . We can not weigh our good deeds over against our evil deeds and claim that the former should be regarded as cancelling out the latter . <p> The fact that we are all sinners does not mean that we have lost the image of God . The Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's essential nature and destiny . Rather , we cease to reflect the character of God as fully as we should . If people were originally created good , we can say that we have lost that goodness , and indeed the Bible is unsparing in its delineation of the sheer wickedness of the human heart ( Genesis 8:21 ; Jeremiah 17:9 ; Romans 3:9 " 18 ) . And this is the condition of all of us . The sin of Adam is repeated in the lives of all men . The evil tendency is there from birth ( Psalm 51:5 ) . Theologians refer to this as " original sin , " meaning that our sinfulness is something present in our lives from the start ; we inherit a sinful disposition and we live in a sinful environment which nourishes it and tempts it into sinful action . We are born as self " centered individuals and our natural tendency is to think of ourselves and ignore the claims of God and other people . The purpose of our upbringing and education is to wean us away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and is done to fit us for life in society , but without changing our essential nature . Sin remains in our lives and produces its effects . <p> What , then , are the effects of sin ? It should not be forgotten that the existence of evil has " cosmic " effects , to which we have already alluded . In the Bible , natural calamities , hard and unproductive labour , disease and so on are all regarded as reflections of the fact that the universe as a whole , and not merely mankind , fails to fulfill the divinely intended pattern ; it is a " fallen world " in which we live ( cf. Genesis 3:14 " 19 ; Romans 8:19 " 22 ) . But our concern here is with the effects of human sin . <p> First , it leads to suffering , both for the guilty and the innocent , for the sinners and those affected by their actions . Sin violates the divine pattern for life . It shatters a person 's fellowship with their neighbors , hardens the sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off from communion with God . It brings its own unpleasant consequences in this life , quite apart from the final judgment of God ( Romans 1:18 " 32 ; 2:5 ; Galatians 6:7 ) . One of the ugliest features of sin is that it affects not only the sinner , but also a host of other people who had no part in their particular sin . <p> Second , sin enslaves the sinner . It is not just a matter of isolated sinful thoughts and deeds . Sin is an evil force which takes control of a person 's heart and will ; it gains an even tighter hold upon them so that they are more and more incapable of doing the right and the good . At times they may be an unconscious and willing victim ; at others they may cry out against the evil force which grips them like a cancer and will not let go ( Romans 7:14 " 20 ) . <p> Third , sin leads to guilt in the sight of God . The word " guilt " is often used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person may or may not have after doing what is wrong . Psychologists can offer cures for guilt " feelings , and these have their value when a person has an irrational sense of guilt . But the theological use of " guilt " is akin to the legal use . It is an objective status in the eyes of the law or of God . It is the state of having broken the law or rejected the will of God , and is real and indisputable , whether or not the person feels " guilty " about what they have done . Guilt means liability to condemnation and punishment ; the sinner stands condemned in the sight of God ( Romans 3:19 ; James . 2:10 ) . <p> Thus , fourth , sin leads to punishment . In ordinary usage the word " punishment " expresses a variety of elements . Punishment may be designed to deter evil-doers from crime , or it may be meant to restrain a particular criminal from further criminal acts , or it may include the attempt to reform the criminal by transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may combine these features . But it also may contain an element of retribution . This is seen in the fact that punishment is inflicted only on the guilty , while attempts to deter , restrain or reform criminals or likely criminals need not be confined to those who have actually broken the law . Retribution means the upholding of the law against those who would break it . A law would not be a law if it could be broken with impunity and no attempt made to enforce it . A penalty does not merely deter people from breaking the law again , nor does it merely act as a disincentive to people against a prospective act of disobedience : " I shall not do x because if I do I shall have to pay a fine .

The penalty is summed up as death , which is the cessation of the divine life in a person . Through sin fellowship and contact with God are broken ; the sinner fears God 's presence ( Genesis 3:8 ; Luke 5:8 ; 1 John 2:28 ) ; and they pass out of God 's care into the power of sin ( Romans 1:24ff . ) . The sinner can be said to die spiritually while they are still alive physically . Physical death itself is symbolic and part of this spiritual death ( Genesis 2:16f. ; Romans 5:12ff. ; 6:23 ) . Finally , the sinner suffers total exclusion from the presence of God ; this is spoken of as hell or the second death ( Matthew 25:41 ; 2 Thessalonians 1:9 ; Revelation 20:11 " 15 ) .

@@35723351 @4723351/ <h> Distinctive Theologies in the Gospel of John <h> I. Introduction <p> At long last we come to the gospel of John , by far the most distinctive of the four gospels in the New Testament . For those who have not read John closely on the heels of one or more of the synoptics , it may be worth reviewing just how different a gospel John is . Many of the details and themes central to the synoptic gospels are largely , if not completely , absent from John : the baptism of Jesus , the calling of the twelve disciples , exorcisms , the transfiguration , parables and Jesus ' words over the bread and cup at the Last Supper . On the other hand John has numerous lengthy discourses or dialogues of Jesus with the disciples or with crowds , but none of them is the same as the few found in the synoptics . He has distinctive and dramatic miracles , like turning water into wine , or the resurrection of Lazarus . <p> Chronologically , he focuses on a period of Jesus ' ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . And then , during the main phase of Jesus ' adult ministry , with just a few parallels to episodes from the synoptic gospels , John focuses primarily on the times Jesus traveled to Jerusalem at the annual festivals of the Jews and the ways that His teachings and claims about His own identity on those occasions demonstrated the fulfillment of the deepest meaning of the rituals and festivals and events that they commemorated . On top of all of this , John 's narrative seems to reflect a quite different style of writing than that in the synoptic gospels , including among the teachings of Jesus . The style found among John 's accounts of Jesus ' teaching is quite similar to John 's style as narrator throughout the rest of his gospel . <h> II . Structure of John 's Gospel <p> Even before we come to focusing on the thematic or theological distinctives that result from these distinctive contents , it is worth asking : Can John be taken seriously as a reliable historical document in light of all of these differences ? How and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , in fact , there are so many differences ? <p> It would appear that John recognized ( as the last and latest of the gospels to be written , probably in the decade of the 90s of the first century ) that much that had already been dealt with well in one or more of the synoptics had become well enough known in Christian circles ( whether through the actual final form of those previous gospels or simply through the pervasive oral tradition and preaching of the first Christians ) He did not need to repeat a large percentage of it . <p> It also appears , when one compares in any modern language , but particularly in the original Greek of New Testament times , that , unlike Matthew , Mark and Luke , there is no formal literary relationship between John and any of the synoptics . In the minority of instances where there are parallel texts between John and the synoptics , the actual wording is seldom similar enough for any significant stretch of text to suggest any actual literary borrowing . But , granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can we account for such a seemingly different choice of details and the resulting themes that we are about to survey ? <h> b . Written to Jewish Christians who have been Expelled from their Synagogues because of their Belief in Jesus as Messiah <p> Part can , no doubt , be explained by the unique context of John . Strong early church tradition associates the aged apostle with ministering in his latter decades in and around Ephesus on the western coast of what today would be called Turkey . By the end of the first century , he had to deal with twin doctrinal challenges in that community , as in many parts of the empire at the end of the first century . <p> On the one hand , by this stage many local synagogues , formally or informally had rejected , sometimes formally expelling or excommunicating , those of their membership who affirmed allegiance to Jesus as Messiah ( much as we discussed in the background to the theology of Matthew , though at this later date on even a more widespread basis ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp . Compare , for example , this same apostle John 's description in the book of Revelation in the letters to the seven churches of Asia Minor , which included Ephesus and neighboring environs , that the local synagogues there were so hostile to Christians that they could be called synagogues of Satan ( see especially Revelation 2:9 and 3:9 ) . <h> c . Written to Address the Influence of Gnosticism <p> On the other hand , this was the age of emerging Gnosticism . This was a Greek philosophy that posited a sharp break or divide between the material and immaterial parts of creation , including the human being . It was only one 's spirit that was believed to survive death . The body , like all of the material universe , was believed to be inherently evil and therefore not redeemable . <p> This meant that , for the Christian message , those claiming that Jesus was the unique God-man , fully divine and fully human , had to confront the challenge that many Jews posed : How could a man be considered God ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgressing the boundary between creature and creator ? In this more Greek or Gnostic environment , on the other hand , the challenge was : How could God , that which is perfect and invisible and immaterial , take on true human flesh if , in fact , that meant that he ( or in some Greek circles she or goddesses ) would be inherently evil ? <p> Not surprisingly then , a large percentage of the distinctive contents , particularly in the middle chapters of John 's gospel , do reflect the intense debates already in Jesus ' life with Jewish leaders and at times larger crowds in Jerusalem . This is precisely what we should have expected Jesus , as a law-abiding Jew , to attend . We expect this even though the synoptics have chosen not to narrate any trips to Jerusalem of the adult Jesus prior to the Passover at which He would lose His earthly life . <p> At the same time , the opening and closing portions of John 's gospel very much stress His true humanity . We , as modern readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmations of Jesus ' deity . Indeed , the very first verse begins affirming that the Word was God . But it may well be that , to emerging Gnostics in an around the church in Ephesus , this was John 's way of beginning with a point of common ground , but then driving the discussion to the climactic point on which " Orthodox and Gnostic " Christians disagreed : namely , the true humanity of Jesus , the true incarnation affirmed in 1:14 " " The Word became flesh and dwelled among us . " <p> For the same reasons , at the end of the gospel , John goes out of his way to stress in the passion narrative the true humanity of Jesus when Pilate declares , bringing out the condemned prisoner : " Behold the man " " not behold your king , which is what the subject of conversation has most recently been . And again , when the soldiers discovered Jesus dead , or appearing to be dead , and to confirm it thrust a sword into His side , out flowed blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the heart for a very recently deceased victim . Likewise too , the two chapters of resurrection appearances at the end of John 's gospel ( 20 and 21 ) represent first Mary Magdalene and the apostle Thomas ( 20 ) and then Peter and the beloved disciple John ( 21 ) , each in their own ways overcoming doubts and misunderstanding and disbelief and lack of recognition of Jesus to recognize His complete human bodily resurrection from the dead . Indeed , all of the signs and miracles throughout John 's gospel are meant to function as pointers to bring people to faith in Christ or to strengthen that faith , as the purpose statement of John 20:31 so clearly states . <h> III . John 's View of Jesus <p> Much else could be said in this context , but it is time , in a short lecture series on The Theology of the Gospels , to turn to enumerating those Johannine theological distinctives in more detail . <h> a . Titles of Jesus <p> Views of Jesus include not only distinctive titles and functions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the synoptics , it is intriguing to note that both in his nearly closing purpose statement in John 20:31 and throughout the gospel , with a fair degree of frequency , the titles Christ and Son of God ( or simply Son ) appear exactly as in Mark 's headline which we discussed in lecture 4 ( see again Mark 1:1 ) . Jesus is both the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed Deliverer of Israel ) and the Son of God ( the One with a unique and uniquely intimate relationship , sonship , with His heavenly Father ) . <p> But Son in the gospel of John more consistently begins to move in a direction of and shade over toward the more divine sense of that title which is less frequent in the synoptics . This is only appropriate as another thirty years may have passed since the writing of the synoptics . John 3:31-36 is a key passage that sums up John 's Christology in significant measure : " The One who comes from above is above all , for the One whom God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God gives the Spirit without limit . The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in His hands . Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life and whoever rejects the Son will not see life . " <h> 1 . The " Logos " <p> Four other emphases are also considerably distinct within the teachings about Jesus that are both dominant and/or distinctive in the fourth gospel . The logos ( the Word ) : only John calls Jesus the Word . The Greek term logos had a remarkably broad usage and application . In Jewish circles , it was the word often used to represent God 's spoken word , through which creation itself was brought into being . In Greco-Roman circles it was often viewed as some aspect of God or the gods that reflected his , her , or their means of communicating with humanity . In pure Stoic Pantheism ( in which God was not distinct from creation ) it often referred to the world soul or life force that was believed to animate and fill all the universe , all the material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term much like Son of Man in the synoptics , with enough ambiguity in its background and yet a rich history of use as well . Jesus , and particularly John 's portrait of Jesus , could invest it with His own distinctive meaning . And clearly , one of the dominant emphases for the fourth gospel is Jesus as Revealer of God the Father . He is Revealer in terms of His deeds , to be sure , but Revealer even more so in terms of His words , because He was , indeed , the very Word of God . <h> 2 . Lamb of God <p> A second distinctive title is Lamb of God , found particularly in John 1 in the context of John the Baptist 's testimony about Jesus . This has the Old Testament background in terms of the Passover lamb " a sacrificial offering to denote forgiveness of sins and take the place of humans who deserve to die for their sins . But also perhaps , it alludes to the sheep led to the slaughter in the context of the Suffering Servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Wisdom of God <p> Even more so than in Matthew , for John , Jesus is thirdly the Wisdom of God . He is Wisdom personified ( much as in Proverbs 8 and 9 ) , but separated even more from God to become a distinct person , while still one being with the Father . But more so merely than God 's Wisdom , this function in the gospel of John quickly shades over into the One He has sent " the divinely appointed Agent , the sent One ( in Hebrew the shaliach ) to do God 's will , to display His glory , to reveal His nature to humankind . The Agent acts on behalf of the Master who has sent Him in ways that begin to blur the distinction at times between the two . <h> 4 . God <p> And then fourthly and finally and certainly most dramatically and prepared for by these three previous distinct titles or roles , Jesus becomes God Himself , actually divine . Not that He replaces God the Father or is the sum total of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is like when He takes upon Himself human flesh . Thus , the opening verse of the gospel refers to the Word in the beginning , with a deliberate allusion to Genesis 1:1 , from before creation onward . " In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God . " So they are separate and distinct . But " the Word was God . " So they are not distinct gods but distinct centers of personal consciousness within one God . <p> Seven times in John 's gospel , He uses the affirmation " I am " followed by a metaphorical predicate that reflects some aspect of this divinity : the Bread of life ; the Light of the world ; the Sheep Gate ; the Good Shepherd ; the Resurrection and the Life ; the Way and the Truth and the Life ; and the True Vine . And in a passage like 10:30 and following , He claims to be one with the Father " not just a oneness of will or unity or purpose ( though those certainly are true statements ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews present interpreted as again crossing that threshold between the creature and the Creator . Those who did not believe His claims accused Him of blaspheming and took up stones to attempt to stone Him to death , although they failed . <p> Again , after the resurrection , Thomas seeing Christ 's scars and acknowledging that He is indeed risen from the dead , cries out in worship : " My Lord and my God . " Interestingly , these are the very titles that , at least by the end of the first century in the reign of Domitian , were clearly attributed to and accepted by the emperor in Rome as titles of worship that he alone was worthy of . Here is an implicit , but nevertheless clear , challenge to that claim which Christians would have found blasphemous . Only Jesus is ultimate Master and God . <h> IV . Themes in the Gospel of John <h> a . Benefits of Eternal Life <p> Other distinctive themes ( and there are more of these in John 's gospel than in any of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal life through following Jesus . Accepting His free gift of salvation is something that begins now in this life already , even if only in part . Or , to put it in the language we used when discussing the synoptic gospels , the emphasis on the already of the kingdom . John frequently substitutes the expression eternal life , which does not do a disservice to Jesus ' teaching , because , even in Matthew 's account of the rich young ruler in chapter 19 , kingdom of God and being saved and experiencing eternal life are used as parallel expressions for each other . John then reflects eternal life as beginning now in the present and extending on into the future . In terms of the already but not yet language , clearly he is more interested in emphasizing the already . <p> Thus we read in a passage like John 3:18 , " Whoever believes in Him that is , Jesus is not condemned . But whoever does not believe , stands condemned already , because he has not believed in the name of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal death that begins in this life as well . But now compare 5:24 , " Whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not be condemned . He has crossed over past tense , already in this life , he has crossed over from death into life . " Compare similar sentiments in John 3:36 , 9:39 and 12:31 . Yet a future hope is not entirely absent . There are references to the coming resurrection of both the just and the unjust ( see especially chapter 5:25-29 ) . <h> b . John Refers to Miracles as " Signs " <p> A second additional distinctive theme is that John does not refer to Christ 's miracles ( though he narrates a good seven of them ) as powers or wonders , the terms most commonly used in the synoptics . Rather he refers to them as signs ( s- " meion ) , pointers that should lead people to faith or strengthen already existing faith . This does not mean that John 's gospel promises miracles on demand for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very interesting variations in terms of human preparedness for the miraculous . Just in the gospel of John alone ( to say nothing of the synoptics all together ) , in chapter 5 Jesus heals a paralytic who was unable to reach the pool of Bethesda to experience what he believed were its healing waters . And afterwards He tells the man : " Go and sin no more , lest something worse befall you " " seemingly implying that it was this man 's lack of faith , indeed his outright sin or disobedience , which had some connection was his previous malady . <p> But then , chapter 9 , with the blind man , who is involved with another pool of water in Jerusalem . He is told to wash in the pool of Siloam to experience full healing . He is someone , at the beginning of chapter 9 , that John describes as having been blind from birth . Imagine the puzzle in the disciple 's minds ( given that the common Old Testament notion , apparently reinforced by Jesus in the healing miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often a punishment for sin ) as they struggle to figure out how such punishment could begin already at birth . So they ask : Who sinned , this man ( perhaps thinking he had done something already in the womb of his mother ) or his parents ( no doubt , reflecting on those Old Testament principles in which the sins of the ancestors are visited on coming generations , at times for a considerable length of time ) ? Jesus replies that neither of those options is true in this case , but that this has taken place so that God 's glory might be revealed : namely , the glory that is disclosed when Jesus heals the man . <p> So there is no uniform connection between sin and sickness , between faith and healing . There are times when people 's faith leads to signs or miracles in John more generally . There are times , as with the turning of water into wine and the healing of the nobleman 's son ( in John 2 and 4 respectively ) , when the signs are meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , function in that way , where there is little or no faith prior to the working of the miracles . The nearly closing chapter ( John 20:21 ) finds Jesus praising Thomas ' belief based on the sign of the resurrection which he has now encountered first hand . And yet it goes on , in what is seemingly higher praise , to say : " Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . " <p> It may be that we are to understand three stages in John 's concept of faith : an initial childlike stage that is at least open to faith which is required before God will grant any sign ; a preliminary faith that sometimes is based solely or too much on signs ; and a mature faith that no longer requires them , even if God might in His sovereignty choose to graciously grant them at times . <h> c . Doctrine of the Trinity <p> A third distinctive and dominant theme in John 's gospel involves the clearest steps found anywhere in the gospels toward a full-blown doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be clarified in subsequent centuries to an even greater degree . And there is the accompanying unity based on the unity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit that Jesus ' followers ought to display . John 14:11 uses the language of interpenetration . Jesus insists that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him . Then , when He leaves , the Spirit will replace Him as another Counselor or Comforter , performing many of the identical roles that He has played ( John 14:16 ) . In His so-called high priestly prayer in chapter 17 , He speaks of the Father glorifying the Son so that the Son can glorify the Father , and vice versa . <p> There also appears to be a hierarchy that in no way infringes on the full equality of the persons of the Trinity , especially in 14:28 when Jesus declares : " The Father is greater than I. " This is perhaps meant to be a model of how humans can be fundamentally equal to one another and still , in various contexts , be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is authority and submission based on perfect love and perfect unity . <p> Thus , the challenge of Jesus ' prayer for His followers in John 17 is indeed striking with these background texts , when He asks of His Father and He prays that they too ( we who are Christians ) might be one just as Jesus says : " You , the Father , are in Me and I am in You " . And this unity in turn is to be so marvelous that it will be a powerful evangelistic force in the world ( verse 23 ) . Surely the church has a long way to go in modeling this before a fallen world . <h> d . Election and Security of the Believer <p> Of all the gospels , John also in greatest detail and most clearly describes the election and the security of the believer . Among the texts that are most famous in this respect are 6:39 . Jesus , speaking again : " This is the will of Him who sent Me , the Father , that I shall lose none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up at the last day . " And again , in 10:29 , " My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all ; no one shall snatch them out of My Father 's hand . " In 15:16 we read that the disciples did not choose Jesus but He chose them . And more ominously , Judas betrayal in 17:12 demonstrates that he was not elected to salvation : " Christ protected all that the Father gave Him , but the betrayer was the one doomed to destruction . " <p> Yet , balancing this emphasis on God 's electing choices , is John 's equally significant emphasis that believers must choose to abide , or remain , in Christ ( particularly in John 15 ) . They must remain in Him so that they can bear much fruit ( verse 4 ) . But this is not simply remaining in order to experience Christian maturity , as opposed to staying in an immature Christian state . Verse 2 offers the solemn warning that the Father cuts off every branch that bears no fruit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as the pruning that He describes in this context , because cutting off branches may allow the rest of a plant to continue to grow or indeed grow better . But it means the death , the complete end of existence for the branches cut off . <p> John 's own harmonization of these apparently contradictory lines of thought appears in his first letter ( 1 John 2:19 ) . There are people who do abandon what they previously have professed with respect to Christian faith : that is , abandon it altogether , leave Christ , leave His Church and follow some other contradictory , incompatible , false teaching . This took place in Ephesus not long after John 's gospel was written and John replies to it in 1 John 2:19 . He describes such people , saying : " They went out from us , but they did not really belong to us . For if they had belonged to us , they would have remained . The verb to abide , or to remain , with us is used in John 15 But their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Yes , there are promises for security of the believer throughout the New Testament and particularly in John 's writings . But the security and assurance of salvation are present only as people remain in the vine " continue believing in Jesus , remain connected to Him . If they do not , it demonstrates that they never really truly were connected . But it means also that , short of repentance , they will be lost . So with John 's precious promises must be also be paired his equally crucial warnings . <h> e . Jesus ' Death , Resurrection and Glorification <p> Still another dominant and distinctive theme in John 's gospel is his portrait of the death of Christ " not as a single event in time , but as already anticipating and symbolic of His coming resurrection and ascension and return to the right hand of the Father . This has come to be known as Jesus ' exaltation , or enthronement , or glorification . Thus , we read in 12:32 , " But I , when I am lifted up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Presumably Christ here is anticipating both His physical crucifixion and His spiritual exaltation " the posture of arms extended and body distended on the cross , but also anticipating the heavenly journey after His death and resurrection . John 7:39 , 12:16 , 23 and 13:31 all anticipate His coming hour of glory with similar double meanings . <h> f . Role of the Holy Spirit as Counselor , Comforter and Advocate <p> Yet another theme in our list is the Holy Spirit . In Greek , this is the word parakletos , sometimes rendered into English just as the term Paraklete . This is a word for which there is no single translation in most modern languages . It combines such concepts as Counselor or Comforter or Advocate . F. F. Bruce discerns five discrete roles for the Paraklete in John 14 to 16 alone : He is a Helper of God 's people ( 14:15-21 ) ; He is an interpreter of God 's revelation ( 14:25-31 ) ; a witness or one who testifies to the truth of God ( 15:26-16:4 ) ; a Prosecutor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lack of adequate righteousness and God 's coming judgment ( 16:5-11 ) ; and of Revealer of God 's truth and of God Himself ( 16:12-16 ) . <p> It is possible at the end of the first century that certain wings of the church were moving more and more in the direction of an institutionalization that goes beyond what the New Testament itself endorsed . John 's community was a bit of a holdout or a carry-over from an earlier era , when the Spirit 's role was seen as more significant than authoritative hierarchical offices for those who held them to make decisions governing the entire body of the local Christian community . <h> g . John 's Gospel does not Record Jesus ' Baptism or His Words over the Food at the Last Supper <p> One of the puzzling features of John 's narrative , as we have already mentioned , is the absence of explicit reference to Jesus ' baptism and to His words over the bread and cup at the Last Supper . These absences are made all the more notable , unlike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these specific details John has more information in his opening episode about John the Baptist of the events immediately surrounding Christ 's baptism than do any of the synoptics . And in even more dramatic fashion in John 13-17 , what never is narrated in more than one long chapter in the synoptics spans five chapters in John 's gospel : namely , the events of the last night of Jesus ' life and the last meal that they enjoyed together . And yet not a word about what has come to be known as the Lord 's Supper or the Eucharist or Holy Communion . <p> Adding to the intrigue is the fact that , in a completely different context in John 's gospel , appear language from Jesus Himself that many readers have seen as allusions to what in many branches of Christianity have become known as the sacraments ( or elsewhere as the ordinances ) of Baptism and the Lord 's Supper . John 3:5 , " No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptism . And again 6:53 , " Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , you have no life in you . " If that is not cannibalism , as some in the Roman world misunderstood early Christian belief and practice , then is it teaching that one must partake of the sacrament to have eternal life ? This would appear unlikely , because in the same context we read that it is the Spirit , and not the flesh , that alone brings life . <p> Perhaps we should understand instead that John is speaking metaphorically about close unity with the crucified Christ ( 6:53 ) and metaphorically about the cleansing work of the Spirit ( 3:5 ) . Perhaps in fact , by omitting explicit references to Baptism and the Lord 's Supper where the synoptics contain them , he is again trying to counter a growing institutionalization of the church near the end of the first century that may be already on the verge of elevating the sacraments to too prominent a role in the church , such that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But these are more speculative comments than those we have made in the other categories thus far in this lecture . <h> h . John the Baptist 's Authority is Minimized <p> Equally speculative , but equally suggestive also , has to do with the way in which John the Baptist 's authority is consistently minimized throughout John 's gospel , especially when compared to the synoptics ' portrait . Thus , the Baptist is only a witness . He must decrease while Christ must increase . He explicitly denies that he is even a prophet like Elijah . The synoptics allow that figuratively , he is Elijah come again in the power and spirit of Elijah . And when interviewers in John 1 come from the Jerusalem authorities to ask John about his identity , they not only ask about a possible prophetic role , but if he is the Christ . This he flat out denies . Why emphasize this unless , as we know there were in the mid-second century in parts of the Greek world of the day , already some near the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist and indeed at times giving him , rather than Jesus , Messianic status ? <h> i . Concluding Comments <p> Two final comments about dominant and distinctive Johannine themes " Jesus relationship to Judaism and the resulting relationship of John 's community to Judaism . Like Matthew , he has often been accused of being anti-Semitic , or better put anti-Jewish , because of his seemingly sweeping use of the term the Jews for all of Jesus ' opponents . This expression appears 68 times in John , but only 16 times in Matthew , Mark and Luke combined . But , looking at individual contexts , this term sometimes means merely Judeans as opposed to Galileans ( those in the southern part of Israel rather than in the north ) . Sometimes it is a kind of shorthand or code term for the Jewish leaders , at least those opposed to Jesus . And never does it mean more than simply those members of the Jewish nation and religion who rejected Christ . Let 's not forget that all of His first followers , even in John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing even in the strong text such as John 8:44 , " You are of your father the devil , " that indicts all Jews of Jesus ' time , much less of all time . And , short of that sweeping statement , it is not legitimate to speak of John as anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish . <p> Finally , there are what have been called dualisms or oppositions of a number of different kinds in the fourth gospel . John certainly does like to paint theological pictures in very black and white terms , to use a modern metaphorical dualism . Thus we see light contrasted with darkness ; life versus death ; love versus judgment ; that which is from above with that which is from below ; spirit versus flesh ; truth versus falsehood ; those who believe versus the world . And everyone of these oppositions reflects those or that which is on God 's side as determined by their reaction to Jesus and those who are against God as determined also by their reaction , in this case a rejection rather than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture series then , it is appropriate to ask the question : Which side are you on ? If in all the shades of grey , as it were , with all of the humanly erected divisions into which humanity can be categorized , there are from God 's perspective only ultimately two : those who follow Jesus and those who reject Him . It is my prayer that all who hear these tapes and all who hear the gospel in any form will respond by accepting the marvelous , wonderful , eternal , free , utterly undeserved gift of spectacularly joyous life experienced in part , but only in part in this life , but guaranteed for those who are truly God 's people who demonstrate it because they remain in Him , in Jesus , until the end , until the end of this age or their lives , whichever comes first . And thus can look forward to unending happiness in a life to come .

Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body , which is the church , in filling up what is lacking in Christ 's afflictions . <p> The Body of Christ ( Local ) <p> 1 Corinthians 12:21-27 <p> The eye can not say to the hand , " I have no need of you , " nor again the head to the feet , " I have no need of you .

Eleven Biblical Principles of Local Church Governance <p> Principle One <p> The Local Church is governed by Christ ( Matthew 16:18 ) . This governance was mediated through the authority of the apostles and their close associates ( Ephesians 2:20 ; 1 Corinthians 2:12-13 ; 7:17 ; 14:37-38 ; 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of his apostles as they are preserved for us in the inspired writings of the New Testament . Therefore , every effort will be made to conform the structure and procedures and spirit of church governance as closely as possible to New Testament guidelines , with a constant eye to promoting the glory of God and the advancement of faith ( 1 Corinthians 10:31 ; Philippians 1:25 ) . <p> Matthew and the gates of Hades will not overpower it . <p> Ephesians 2:19-20 <p> So then you are . . . the household of God , built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone . <p> 1 Corinthians 2:12-13 <p> Now we have received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God . And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 Corinthians 7:17 <p> Only , let every one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him , and in which God has called him . This is my rule in all the churches . <p> 1 Corinthians 14:37-38 <p> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord 's commandment . But if anyone does not recognize this , he is not recognized . <p> 2 Thessalonians 3:14 <p> If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter , take special note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he will be put to shame . glory of God . <p> Philippians 1:25 <p> Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith . <p> Principle Two <p> The ministry of the church is primarily the work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward each other and witness toward the world . Internal structures for church governance are not the main ministry of the church , but are the necessary equipping and mobilizing of the saints for the work of ministry . <p> of the body of Christ . <p> Principle Three <p> Governance structures should be lean and efficient to this end , not aiming to include as many people as possible in office-holding , but to free and fit as many people as possible for ministry ( implied in the preceding principle ) . <p> Principle Four <p> Christ is the head of the church and , spiritually , all his disciples are on a level ground before him , each having direct access to him and responsibility to intercede for the good of all as a community of priests . <p> Ephesians 4:15 <p> Speaking the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects into Him who is the head , even Christ . <p> Matthew 23:8-11 <p> But do not be called Rabbi ; for One is your Teacher , and you are all brothers .

But the greatest among you shall be your servant . <p> 1 Timothy 2:5 <p> For there is one God , and one mediator also between God and men , the man Christ Jesus . <p> Revelation 1:6 <p> Christ has made us to be a kingdom , priests to His God and Father " to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen . 
@@35723361 @4723361/ <h> The Ethics of the Kingdom of God <p> This is tape 2 in the series on the Theology of the New Testament Gospels . <p> In our first lecture , we discussed the central feature of Jesus ' ministry as portrayed in the synoptic gospels : namely the arrival of the kingdom of God in a present and yet still future capacity , often summarized by the slogan already but not yet . The presentation contained much rich theology , but the listener could be forgiven for wondering at the end what practical difference the kingdom teaching of Jesus makes for Christian living . That question leads us naturally to the topic for this lecture , namely , the Ethics of the Kingdom . Almost as much of Jesus ' teaching is about how His followers should live , as about what they should believe and how they should think about God 's ways with humanity . We will reflect on Jesus ' ethics ( the foundation for Christian ethics ) under nine headings and allude to a variety of passages in Matthew , Mark and Luke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mindset <p> As an important introductory topic , we may remind ourselves that people in the first century Mediterranean world often thought corporately , or communally . That is to say , they thought as members of groups . And they thought of their responsibilities and obligations to those groups , before they thought of individual rights or responsibilities . Because this is so different from at least the modern Western world , though certainly not in many other parts of today 's world , it is a good reminder to place it as our first sub-topic . We do this before proceeding to commands where we potentially might misinterpret or not fully interpret Jesus ' meaning because we were thinking as rugged Western individualists. <h> a . Matthew 6:33 <p> Indeed , we may use two examples of this corporate dimension of Jesus ' ethic here already under this first heading . In the Sermon on the Mount , Matthew 6:33 ( with parallels in Luke 12 ) declares , " But seek first God 's kingdom and His righteousness and all these things things that Jesus has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing will be given to you as well . " But how are we to understand this text when many faithful , obedient Christians throughout history have not , at key junctures in their lives , had adequate food or drink or clothing ? What about those who have starved to death ? What about those who have languished without release in prison or even suffered martyrdom ? <p> The observation that the personal pronouns in this verse , as so often in Jesus ' teaching , are all plural , helps us make sense of His promise . But you ( plural , the community of My disciples , what today we call the church ) seek first His kingdom and His righteousness . And we know that part of God 's righteousness is supplying the basic physical and material , as well as spiritual , needs , particularly of His followers . Therefore , as the church is obedient to this command , it will take care , at least at a minimal level , of the poor and the needy in its midst in Christian circles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , at the very least , it will take care of fellow Christians . In this context , we do not need to speak of either broad generalizations or strictly heavenly interpretations of good in the life to come . Rather , we can quite literally claim the promise that , when the church functions as it has been called to , the basics of life will be provided for its members . <h> b . Mark 10:29 <p> Or consider Mark 10:29 ( and parallels ) , which also functions in a confirming way for the interpretation of Matthew 6:33 ( and parallels ) just offered . Here Jesus has been speaking to the rich , young ruler and then to the disciples about the dangers of wealth . Peter , ever the impetuous spokesman for the twelve , in verse 28 pipes up : " We have left everything to follow You . " And Jesus replies , " Truly , I tell you , no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for Me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this present age : homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children and fields , along with persecutions , and in the age to come , eternal life . " Mark makes it very clear that His promise , quoting Jesus , is not strictly eschatological or reserved for the future . It includes new family members in this present age . How do Christians gain up to a hundred-fold new family members ? Clearly in the family of God 's people . So it only follows that the way in which they receive a hundred times as many homes and fields , property or material possessions , is also through the church . God 's people share with those who are in need and make available their resources to their fellow believers with great generosity , sitting loose to their possessions and sharing them as appropriate . <h> II . Creating Community " Biblical Family Values <p> These two introductory texts lead us , therefore , to a second sub-topic of Jesus ' kingdom ethics : namely , creating community more specifically and intentionally , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in light of contemporary political rhetoric that regularly cites family values , but does so for a whole host of competing perspectives . <h> a . Family Affirming ( Mark 10:1ff ) <p> Moving just back to the beginning of Mark 10 and the first two passages therein , we read about Jesus ' prohibition against divorce . The parallel in Matthew 19 will allow for one exception in the case of sexual infidelity , but it is clear that the overall impetus from Jesus is to noticeably tighten up what , in His day , were very loose standards with respect to divorce ( much like is true in many parts of the Western world today ) . Thus , we may speak of Jesus ' ethic as indeed family-affirming . <p> He goes on after the first twelve verses of Mark to affirm little children in what certainly was a counter-cultural fashion for that time and place . In that culture , children were very much not merely to be seen but not heard , but often not even to be seen or treated as full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , constituted adulthood ) . <h> b . Mark 7 <p> Jesus will elsewhere , in Mark 7 for example , and the opening episode that spans the first twenty verses , reaffirm the central command from the Ten Commandments of honoring father and mother . He does this in the context of chastising certain Jewish leaders for reserving certain material possessions of theirs for later use in the temple while they could still profit by them , a practice known as Corban . They did this even when neglecting their own parents who were in acute need . <h> c . Loyalty to Spiritual " Family " vs . Biological Family <p> Yet intriguingly , perhaps more pervasive in the gospels than family-affirming values are family-relativizing values . Or to put it another way , recognizing that community with God and with all believers , when it comes into conflict with loyalties to one 's biological family members , must take precedence . <h> 1 . Mark 3:31-35 <p> Thus , we read at the end of Mark 3:31-35 ( and parallels ) what would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brothers arrived , standing outside a room in which He was ministering and they sent someone in to call Him . The crowd informs Him of this fact and His reply is to ask : " Who are My mother and My brothers ? " And then He looked at those seated in a circle around Him , the twelve and other close followers of His at that stage of His ministry , and declared : " Here are My mother and My brothers . Whoever does God 's will is My brother and sister and mother . " <h> 2 . Luke 14:26 <p> Or again in Luke 14:26 , a passage that is perhaps even more striking , particularly in its Lucan form , Jesus is speaking to large crowds about counting the costs of following Him . He declares : " If anyone come to Me and does not hate father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters , yes even life itself , such a person can not be My disciple . " Fortunately there is a parallel in Matthew 10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in Greek and Hebrew , often did not have emotional connotations . Rather they referred to choose or not choose , prefer or not prefer . Therefore , we read in Matthew 10:37 , " Anyone who loves their father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me . And anyone who loves a son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me . " Jesus is not contradicting His commands elsewhere to honor father and mother , nor even His more sweeping commands to love all people ( which certainly includes family members ) . But if there is a conflict between God and family , God must always take precedence . And the love must be so much greater for God , that loyalty to family may seem like hate in comparison . <h> 3 . Matthew 19:1-12 <p> Finally , returning to the text on marriage and divorce and remarriage , this time in its distinctive Matthean form in Matthew 19:1-12 , we read an additional segment not present in the parallel accounts . There are some called to a celibate life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of heaven ( see especially Matthew 19:12 ) . In a world in which almost all healthy adult Jewish men were expected to be married , this is indeed counter-cultural and fits Jesus ' own lifelong state of celibacy . There is a time and a place to recognize the greater lifelong devotion that one can give to God 's kingdom work apart from marriage and family ( even if that remains more of the exception than the norm throughout church history ) . <p> In short , we may sum up what Jesus is teaching under this heading of creating a spiritual community above concerns for a biological family with the little teachings in Luke 9:57-62 ( and parallels ) about the need for wholehearted allegiance to God . Jesus is on the road and is approached by a pair of apparent would-be disciples . One says : " I will follow You wherever You go . " But Jesus replies : " Foxes have holes and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head . " Apparently the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time taking the initiative Himself : " Follow Me " . But the man replies : " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . " This is possibly not merely a reference to participating in a funeral of a recently deceased parent , but staying at home for the various Jewish mourning customs and family obligations after a death . These culminated in the exhuming of the body and reburying the skeletal remains in a smaller coffin or ossuary up to a year or so afterwards . Nevertheless , we do not want to take the sting out of Jesus ' command as He replies : " Let the dead bury their own dead but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God . " <p> Nor again , the appended saying in verses 61 to 62 . Still another said : " I will follow you Lord , but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family . " This perhaps again involves multiple days and an extensive set of ceremonies and festivities . Nevertheless , Jesus replies : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God . " God 's kingdom and loyalty to the church , the subjects of that kingdom , takes precedence over even the most poignant of family responsibilities when the two come into conflict . <h> III . Stewardship of Material Possessions <p> A third major topic of Jesus ' kingdom ethics , and the one on which some have estimated up to 20% of all of Jesus ' teaching in the four gospels directly addresses , is that of stewardship of material possessions . We take just two crucial , but representative triads of teaching . <h> a . Three Parables in Luke <p> In Luke , there are a trio of parables on the rich and riches , beginning in Luke 12:13-21 with the so-called Parable of the Rich Fool . At first glance , it could appear that this man is condemned simply because he had great possessions : a bumper crop ( an unexpected surplus ) and doing what would have otherwise been seen as good stewardship so that the harvested grain did not rot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , at the same time , in a world in which 70 to 80% of all of Israel 's inhabitants eked out a marginal existence barely above the poverty line , the eight uses of the first person singular in the Greek of this passage proves striking . I will do this and I will do that . And there is not a mention anywhere of taking concern for the needy around him , with what is otherwise unnecessary , extra foodstuffs . We are grateful , perhaps , as we read at the end of the parable that this is how it will be with those who store up things for themselves , but are not rich toward God . This suggests that this rich man did not have a personal relationship with Yahweh , Jew though he may have been portrayed as . On the other hand , the very way that that lack of a relationship as demonstrated is by his utterly self-centered use and desired uses of material possessions . This is a strong rebuke to any of us who have surplus possessions and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fashion , the so-called Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31 even more strikingly appears to condemn a very wealthy man merely because he has so much wealth and pays no attention to give even crumbs from his table to a dying beggar at his doorstep , Lazarus . Again , we who have surplus perhaps breathe a sigh of relief , perhaps again too quickly , when we read , in verse 30 , that now , in the life to come , he is concerned about his brothers who still are alive . He wishes someone to go to them from the world of the dead , so that they will repent . The probable implication is that he is admitting he too had never truly repented or been made right with God in this life . But again , the way this fleshes itself out in this particular story that Jesus invents to drive home His theological lessons is through the complete stinginess of one who has far more than he should be keeping for himself . <p> More positively , the immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be like a shrewd servant . Some have called this parable the Parable of the Unjust Steward . This often misleads people into thinking that Jesus was , through the master of the parable , praising the steward 's injustice . That is not what the text says at all . Rather , verse 8 declares the master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly . He then makes an ironic aside that it is often true for the people of this world . Unbelievers are , we might add , often more shrewd in dealing with their own kind ( with fellow unbelievers , that is to say ) , than are the people of light ( that is , Jesus ' followers ) . Therefore , Christ concludes : " I tell you to use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves . " In other words , to pursue kingdom ethics which involve making and nurturing disciples , so that when it ( that worldly wealth , money and all our material possessions in this age ) is gone , you will be welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome you " those friends you have made or nurtured through the compassionate and Christian use of your material possessions . <h> b . Give to those who Need it more than we Do <p> What then specifically should we do with those possessions ? A key focus in the gospels is to give a generous percentage of it to those who are in greater need of it than we are . Of course the most famous text is the text to which we have already alluded about the rich , young ruler in Mark 10:17-31 ( and parallels ) . Is this a command that Jesus , by implication , gives to all Christians : " Go sell all that you have , give to the poor and come and follow Me " ? If it were , then the vast majority of all Christians throughout human history have been flatly disobedient . But in fact , this is the only individual in all of Scripture to whom God or Christ issues such a command . And , as if to underline that fact , Luke soon afterwards juxtaposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited repentance demonstrating salvation when he voluntarily gives up only half of his great wealth and promises to restore fourfold what he has defrauded people . <h> c . Investing Resources and Making a Profit <p> Even more encouraging in a largely capitalist world , no doubt , is the subsequent parable of the pounds ( or menas ) in Luke 19:11-27 . Here the faithful stewards who are praised are those who take their master 's money , invest it and make even more . There is certainly a time and place for wise investment for the sake of the kingdom . But the key is that it is for the sake of the kingdom . As in the parable , the master ( God ) will eventually require an accounting , not of what we have done with just a certain percentage of our material goods , but with all of it : some no doubt to give generously to others , and the rest to still spend wisely , rather than frivolously , on things that would please Him . <h> IV . Compassion for the Outcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads naturally to an even broader and a fourth fundamental sub-category of Jesus ' ethical teaching , namely His compassion for the outcast of His society . These were such groups of individuals as the sick ( most notably the untouchable lepers ) , the poor ( overlapping with our discussions of rich and riches just completed ) , Samaritans ( the descendants of the unlawful intermarriages in Old Testament times between Jew and Gentile ) , the full-fledged Gentile or non-Jewish person , women ( at least to some degree ) , and prostitutes ( the most notorious sinners of society ) . Interestingly tax-collectors are grouped in with them " that oft recurring slogan " tax-collectors and sinners " . While they were not down-and-out like many others in this cluster of communities , their crimes and their lack of loyalty to Israel over against the Roman oppressors made them both particularly ritually unclean and ostracized or stigmatized . Some have called them the up-and-out of Jesus ' world . Jesus declares that He has come to minister , particularly profoundly , to precisely such people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in His public ministry in Galilee , is described in fullest detail in Luke 4:16-21 ( including His quotation from Isaiah 61:1-2 ) . When reading from the Isaiah scroll , Jesus declares : " The Spirit of the Lord is on Me because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor Lord 's favor . " Despite some attempts to interpret these pronouncements in either exclusively spiritual or exclusively material categories , one should keep both together as one understands Jesus ' announcement . He has come , as in the beatitudes , to declare the poor blessed . This is the literal physical poor ( as in Luke 6:20 ) , as well as the poor in spirit ( the corresponding phrase in Matthew 5:3 ) . These do not contradict each other , for the Greek ptochoi ( poor in the plural ) , regularly in the Septuagint translates the Hebrew Old Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came for those who are genuinely socioeconomically impoverished , but who recognize and turn to God as their only hope . <p> If a both-and approach , both spiritual and material poverty , is appropriate for good news to the poor , it certainly is for the imprisoned . Christ came to liberate people from the imprisonment to sin , but also He called on His followers to visit the sick and imprisoned in the famous Parable of the Sheep and the Goats . John 9 and numerous other shorter passages make it very clear that Jesus ' announcement or discussion of the restoration of spiritual sight is regularly linked to His provision of physical sight for people and vice versa . <p> The same can be true of release for the oppressed . Thus , one of Jesus ' central missions was , as in Luke 19:10 , to come to seek and to save the lost ( on which we commented in our first lecture ) . Nowhere is this illustrated more poignantly or in more detail than in the triad of parables of Luke 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost or prodigal son ( or perhaps we should say lost sons ) . Jesus has compassion for the prodigal , the one who has deliberately rebelled and fallen on the hardest of times when he returns and is willing to repent . But He also has compassion on the more subtly lost son , the one who has never left home , but begrudges his father 's welcome for his brother rather than joining in the restoration of a sinner . This was analogous to some of the scribes and Pharisees in Jesus ' day and perhaps in some " Christian circles " in our day . <p> Compassion for the outcast extends to parables of social injustice and prayer as well . In Luke 18:1-14 , the importunate widow begging an unjust judge for justice and God promising that He will much more readily be eager to grant justice to those who pray to Him than was this unjust judge willing , even though he could eventually be badgered into it . And then the parable about the Pharisee and Tax-collector , each of whom prayed . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better he was than the other . The other cried for mercy , based on no merit of his own . Jesus ' reply is that it was this latter , the tax-collector , who went home justified ( right with God ) , rather than the former . <p> Finally , it is interesting that Jesus ' compassion for the outcast led to His regular table fellowship with them . When He created a little parable in Matthew 11 and Luke 7 ( sometimes designated the Parable of the Children in the Marketplace ) , describing people 's caricatures of His ministry and of John the Baptist , for that matter . He describes the caricature of Himself as being that of a glutton and a drunkard and a friend of tax-collectors and sinners . There is that strange combined phrase again . Imagine your profession being linked with sinners more generally . This does not demonstrate that Jesus ever did over-eat or over-drink to an extent that God would have considered sinful . But it does mean that He enjoyed a good meal and a good glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His behavior , they portrayed Him , not as an ascetic , but as one over-indulging . <p> Is that how people caricature us , not because we do indeed over-indulge , but because we are so concerned to be intimately involved with those who do ? We are so concerned for people who need the Lord , that we can be misunderstood in that respect . Or is it that we are caricatured as those who are so offended and repulsed by such behavior that we stay miles away ? The latter is not what Christ had in mind . <h> V. Jesus ' Critique of Religious Conservatives of His Day <p> Indeed , there is a striking contrast between this last and fourth sub-topic of compassion for the outcast and a fifth one that deals with Jesus ' sharp critique for the conservative religious leaders of his world ( see especially the extensive woes and invective against certain scribes and Pharisees in Matthew 23 ) . <p> The last quarter-century of scholarship has clearly demonstrated that at least three features , to varying degrees , characterize the theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has classically been understood , there was a certain dimension of legalism " of belief that certain good works were a requirement for salvation " against which Jesus and Paul strongly protest . More common , was what has been dubbed covenantal nomism . This is the belief that , while one was saved by grace , one worked out or lived out one 's religious life by detailed observance of all of the works of the law . To some degree , under the covenant at Sinai , this was true . But again , motives could transform what was intended to be joyful service to God in gratitude for His salvation into attempts to merit further blessing ( even if not initial relationship with God ) . It would appear that Jesus and the New Testament authors are equally rejecting of covenantal nomism in such passages that we have just seen as the Pharisee and the Publican . Then thirdly there is a fair body of evidence to suggest that Israelite Judaism in the first century was at times inappropriately ethnocentric , even as Christian circles have sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting national interest above universal interest . Jesus ' critique is a sharp one then , and now , as the various points of Matthew 23 and elsewhere unfold . <h> VI . Jesus Exalts Humility as a Virtue , Contrary to the Values of the Culture <p> Conversely , a sixth element of Jesus ' kingdom ethics : He exalts what particularly in the Greco- Roman world of the first century was not considered much of a virtue at all , namely , a humble demeanor . He makes this into a center or central sub-point of His ethical injunctions . Here we may think especially of Matthew 18:1-5 and the commands to become like little children . He is not suggesting that children are subjectively necessarily any more humble than any other people of other ages . Rather , that objectively , like it or not , they are profoundly dependent for life and well-being on the adult world . In the same way , Christians of all ages , just as indeed people of all ages , ought to acknowledge , and Christians hopefully do , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase it alliteratively : Jesus does not commend childishness but child-likeness " in this sense of being in an objectively humble and perhaps at times even humiliating position . <h> VII . Jesus ' Commands for Servant Leadership <p> A seventh sub-point that we may mention briefly is Jesus ' commands to servant leadership ( see especially Mark 10:35-45 and parallels ) . Again , this is a sharp reversal of pagan autocratic standards . A central concern to this day in church and Christian leadership is how easy it is for legitimate authority to turn authoritarian .

If we lose sight of the fact that Jews and Samaritans were often enemies in Jesus ' world , we lose all of the shock value of the passage . Yes , this is a command to go and do likewise ( Luke 10:37 ) . But far more than just loving the needy , it is a call to do likewise by loving the enemy , rather than passing by even in the name of religion , as the priest and Levite may well have done . <p> Indeed Matthew 5:44 and its parallel in Luke put it most poignantly in commanding Jesus ' followers to love their enemies and to pray for those who persecute them .

Continuity between Jesus ' Ethic and the Torah <p> What then results " this reflects our final sub-topic for this lecture " in terms of continuity and discontinuity between Jesus ' ethic and the Torah or Law of Moses ? The clearest answer to this question comes in Matthew 5:17-20 , when Jesus reassures His listeners ( perhaps already in the Sermon on the Mount beginning to wonder if He was in some sense overthrowing the law of Moses ) that He had not come to abolish the law . He had come to fulfill it . And yet fulfillment is not the natural conceptual opposite of abolition , such as preserving intact without change . <p> And it is very clear from Jesus ' subsequent teaching that He sets the stage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doing away of literal animal sacrifices because He has offered the once-for-all sacrifice for the sins of humanity .

And as one continues through the New Testament , one recognizes that , while fundamental moral principles from the Old Testament law remain unchanged , countless elements of what have alternately been called the ritual or ceremonial laws , as well as civil injunctions for Israel as a theocratic state , no longer apply in the same way to believers in the church of Jesus Christ . <p> Indeed the subsequent and so-called antitheses ( the opposites ) of Matthew 5:21-48 , immediately after verses 17-20 , focus more on the discontinuity with the law than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have heard it said of old " and then quotes a fundamental moral teaching of Scripture " not to abolish it , but to sovereignly reinterpret it in a variety of ways .

Sometimes He formally supersedes it , as with the command on oaths , but establishing a higher order principle in this instance that one 's word be of such integrity that no oath is needed to accompany it to assure people of one 's truth-telling . <p> Whatever the approach toward an individual passage , it is clear from the sermon and from Jesus ' ethical teaching elsewhere that He speaks with a sovereign authority that only one believing Himself to be a divine Messiah could . That is why at the end of the Sermon on the Mount , Matthew declares at the end of chapter 7 that the crowds marveled because Jesus taught not like their leaders , but as one who had authority . It is a strange remark when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was an authority that was always derivative .

And He certainly does not , in any instance , cite the precedent of some previous rabbi to support His claims . We have , at the very least , an implicit if not explicit claim here to divine authority or else Jesus was simply a liar or a fool and a blasphemer . <p> Thus , Jesus ' kingdom teaching spans a wide swath of everyday living .

The Word of God <p> The Word of God is the most important means of grace , though Catholics ascribe this honor to the sacraments . <p> a . The Word and the Spirit . While the term ' means of grace ' can be used in a broader sense , it is here used as a designation of the means which the Church is directed to employ . When we speak of the ' Word ' here , we do not refer to the personal Word ( second person in the Trinity , John 1:1 ff. ) , nor to the creative word of power , Ps. 33:6 ; but very specially to the Word of God as it is contained in Scripture and is preached to the Church . 1Pet. 1:25 . It is the word of God 's grace , and therefore the most important means of grace . While the emphasis falls on the Word as it is PREACHED , it may also be brought to men in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of conversation and religious literature . The Word is made effective as a means of grace only through the operation of the Holy Spirit . The Word alone is not sufficient to work faith and conversion , but is yet the necessary instrument . While the Holy Spirit can , He does not ordinarily work without the Word . The preaching of the Word is made fruitful by the operation of the Spirit . <p> b . Two parts of the Word as a means of grace . The Word as a means of grace consists of two parts , namely , the law and the gospel . The law as a means of grace first of all serves the purpose of bringing men under conviction of sin , Rom. 3:20 , making him conscious of his inability to meet the demands of the law , and becoming his tutor to lead him to Christ , Gal . 3:24 . In the second place it is also the rule of life for believers , reminding them of their duties and leading them in the way of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of salvation revealed in Jesus Christ . It exhorts the sinner to come to Christ in faith and repentance , and promises those who truly repent and believe all the blessings of salvation in the present and in the future . It is the power of God unto salvation for every one that believeth . <p> Rom. 1:16 ; " For I am also to the Greek . ( Romans 1:16 ) " <p> 1Cor. 1:18 . " For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God . ( 1 Corinthians 1:18 ) " <h> 2 . The Sacraments in General <p> The Word of God is complete as a means of grace , but the sacraments are not complete without the Word . This must be maintained over against the Roman Catholics , who teach that the sacraments contain all that is necessary unto salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particulars : ( a ) the Word is absolutely necessary , while the sacraments are not ; ( b ) the Word serves to beget and to strengthen faith , while the sacraments can only strengthen it ; and ( c ) the Word is for all the world , but the sacraments only for believers and their seed . The following points deserve attention : <p> a . The parts of the sacraments . Three parts must be distinguished in the sacraments , namely , ( 1 ) The outward and visible sign . Each one of the sacraments contains an external element . This consists of water in baptism , and of bread and wine in the Lord 's Supper . One who receives merely this may be said to receive the sacrament , but does not receive the whole , nor the most important part of it . <p> ( 2 ) The inward spiritual grace signified . A sign points to something that is signified , and this is the internal matter of the sacrament . It may be called righteousness of faith , Rom. 4:11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision ; that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be in uncircumcision , that righteousness might be reckoned unto them ; " the forgiveness of sins , Mark 1:4 ; faith and repentance , Mark 1:4 ; " John came , who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins . " Mark16:16 , " He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned . " or communion with Christ in His death and resurrection , Rom. 6:3-4 ; " 3 Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ? 4 We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death : that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in newness of life .

" <p> ( 3 ) The union between the sign and the thing signified . This really constitutes the essence of the sacrament . Where the sacrament is received in faith , the grace of God accompanies it . <p> The following definition may be given of a sacrament . A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ , in which by sensible signs the grace of God in Christ is represented , sealed , and applied to believers , and they , in turn , express their faith and obedience to God . <p> b . The number of the sacraments . During the Old Testament there were just two sacraments , namely , circumcision and passover . The former was instituted in the days of Abraham , and the latter in the time of Moses . Both were bloody sacraments in harmony with the Old Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sacraments , namely , baptism and the Lord 's Supper , both of which are unbloody . After Christ has brought His perfect sacrifice , no more shedding of blood is needed . The Church of Rome enlarged the number of sacraments in an unwarranted manner by adding confirmation , penance , orders , matrimony , and extreme unction . <p> c . Old and New Testament sacraments compared . The Church of Rome holds that there is an essential difference between the two : the former being merely typical , affecting only the legal standing of the recipient and not his spiritual condition , and depending for their effectiveness on the faith of those who received them ; and the latter working spiritual grace in the hearts of the recipients irrespective of their spiritual condition , merely in virtue of the sacramental action . As a matter of fact , however , there is no ESSENTIAL difference , Rom. 4:11 ; 1Cor. 5:7 ; 10:1-4 ; Col. 2:11 . There are some dispensational differences , however : ( 1 ) The Old Testament sacraments had a national aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pointed forward to the coming sacrifice of Christ , while those of the New Testament point back to the completed sacrifice .

The Word as a means of grace : <p> Rom. 10:17 . " So belief cometh of hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ . " <p> 1Cor. 1:18 . " For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God . " <p> b . The twofold function of the law : <p> Rom. 3:20 . " Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight ; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin . " <p> Rom 7:7 . " What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid .

The New Testament contains more abundant proof if it , John 5:25-29 ; 6:39-40 , 44 ; 11:24-25 ; 1Cor 15 ; 1Thess. 4:13-17 ; Rev. 20:13 . <p> a . The character of the resurrection . Scripture teaches us to look forward to a BODILY resurrection , similar to the resurrection of Christ . The redemption in Christ will include the body , Rom. 8:23 ; 1Cor. 6:13-20 . Such a resurrection is clearly taught in 1Cor. 15 , and in Rom. 8:11 . It will include both the righteous and the wicked , but will be an act of deliverance and glorification only for the former . For the latter the re-union of body and soul will issue in the extreme penalty of eternal death . <p> b .

Pre-millennarians teach a double resurrection : one of the just at the return of Christ , and another of the unjust a thousand years later , at the end of the world . But the Bible speaks of the resurrection of both in a single breath . Dan . 12:2 ; John 5:28-29 ; Acts 24:15 . It connects the judgment of the wicked with the coming of Christ , 2Thess. 1:7-10 , and places the resurrection of the just at the last day , John 6:39-40 , 44 , 54 ; 11:24. <h> 2 . The Last Judgment <p> The doctrine of the resurrection leads right on to that of the last judgment . The Bible speaks of the coming of a final judgment in no uncertain terms , Ps. 96:13 ; 98:9 ; Eccl. 3:17 ; 12:14 ; Matt. 25:31-46 ; Rom. 2:5-10 ; 2Cor. 5:10. 2Tim. 4:1 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge and his assistants .

The angels will assist Him , Matt. 13:41-42 ; 24:31 ; 25:31 , and the saints will also have some share in His judicial work , 1Cor. 6:2-3 ; Rev. 20:4 . <p> b . The parties that will be judged . It is perfectly evident from Scripture that every individual of the human race will have to appear before the judgment seat , Eccl. 12:14 ; Matt. 12:36-37 ; 25:32 ; Rom. 14:10 ; 2Cor. 5:10 ; Rev. 20:12 . Some think that the righteous will be excepted , but this is contrary to Matt. 13:30 , 40-43 , 49 ; 25:31-36 ; 2Cor. 5:10 .

Neither is there any ground to assert with the Pre-millennarians that it will be a day of a thousand years . <p> d . The standard of judgment . The standard by which saints and sinners will be judged will evidently be the revealed will of God . Gentiles will be judged by the law of nature ; Jews by the Old Testament revelation , and those acquainted with the fuller revelation of the gospel will be judged by it , Rom. 2:12 . God will give every man his due . <h> 3 . The Final State <p> The final judgment serves the purpose of setting forth clearly what the final state of each person will be . <p> a .

In this place they will be totally deprived of the divine favour , will experience an endless disturbance of life , will suffer positive pains in body and soul , and will be subject to pangs of conscience , anguish , and despair , Matt. 8:12-13 ; Mark 9:47-48 ; Luke 16:23 , 28 ; Rev. 14:10 ; 21:8 . There will be degrees in their punishment , Matt. 11:22 , 24 ; Luke 12:47-48 ; 20:47 . It is evident that their punishment will be eternal .

This will not be an entirely new creation , but rather a renewal of the present creation . Ps. 102:26-27 ; Heb. 12:26-28 . Heaven will be the eternal abode of believers . Some think of heaven merely as a condition , but the Bible clearly represents it as a place , John 14:2 ; Matt. 22:12-13 ; 25:10-12 . The righteous will not only inherit heaven , but the entire new creation , Matt. 55 : ; Rev. 21:1-3 .

The humanity of Jesus is not called in question . In fact , the only divinity many still ascribe to Him is that of His perfect humanity . There is abundant proof for the humanity of Jesus . He speaks of Himself as man , John 8:40 , and is so called by others , Acts 2:22 ; Rom. 5:15 ; I Cor. 15:21 . He had the essential elements of human nature , namely , a body and a soul , Matt. 26:26 , 38 ; Luke 24:89 ; Heb. 2:14 . Moreover , He was subject to the ordinary laws of human development , Luke 2:40 , 52 , and to human wants and sufferings , Matt. 4:2 ; 8:24 ; Luke 22:44 ; John 4:6 ; 11:35 ; 12:27 ; Heb. 2:10 , 18 ; Heb. 5:7 , 8 . Yet though He was a real man , He was without sin ; He did no sin and could not sin , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I Pet . 2:22 ; I John 3:5 . It was necessary that Christ should be both God and man . It was only as man that He could be our substitute , and could suffer and die ; and only as sinless man that He could atone for the sins of others . And it was only as God that He could give His sacrifice infinite value , and bear the wrath of God so as to deliver others from it , Ps. 40:7-10 ; 130:8 . <p> b . The two natures united in one Person . Christ has a human nature , but He is not a human person . The Person of the Mediator is the unchangeable Son of God . In the incarnation He did not change into a human person ; neither did He adopt a human person . He simply assumed , in addition to His divine nature , a human nature , which did not develop into an independent personality , but became personal in the Person of the Son of God . After this assumption of human nature the Person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the God-man , possessing all the essential qualities of both the human and the divine nature . He has both a divine and a human consciousness , as well as a human and a divine will . This is a mystery which we can not fathom . Scripture clearly points to the unity of the Person of Christ . It is always the same Person who speaks , whether the mind that finds utterance be human or divine , John 10:30 ; 17:5 as compared with Matt. 27:46 ; John 19:28 . Human attributes and actions are sometimes ascribed to the Person designated by a divine title , Acts 20 ; 28 ; I Cor. 2:8 ; Col. 1:13 , 14 ; and divine attributes and actions are sometimes ascribed to the Person designated by a human title , John 3:13 ; 6:62 ; Rom. 9:5 . <p> c . Some of the most important errors concerning this doctrine . The Alogi and the Ebionites denied the deity of Christ in the early Church . This denial was shared by the Socinians of the days of the Reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the early Church Arius failed to do justice to the full deity of Christ and regarded Him as a demi-God , while Apollinaris did not recognize His full humanity , but held that the divine Logos took the place of the human spirit in Christ . The Nestorians denied the unity of the two natures in one Person , and the Eutychians failed to distinguish properly between the two natures . <h> To memorize . Passages to prove : <p> a . The deity of Christ : <p> Isa. 9:6 . " For unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given ; and the government shall be upon His shoulder : and His name shall be called Wonderful , Counsellor , Mighty God , Everlasting Father , Prince of Peace . " <p> Jer. 23:6 . " In His days shall Judah be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely ; and this is His name whereby He shall be called : Jehovah our righteousness @ @ @ @ <p> Rom. 9:5 . " Whose are the fathers , and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God blessed forever . " <p> Col. 2:9 . " For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the God " <p> b . The humanity of Christ : <p> John 8:40 . " But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I heard from God . " <p> Luke 24:39 . " See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself ' . handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye behold me having . " <p> Heb. 2:14 . " Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood , He also Himself in like manner partook of the same ; that through death He might bring to nought him that had the power of death , that is , the devil . " <p> c . The unity of the Person : <p> John 17:5 . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was . " <p> John 3:13 . " And no one hath ascended into heaven , but He that descended out of heaven , even the Son of Man , who is in heaven . " <p> I Cor.2:8 . " Which none of the rulers of this world hath known : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory . " <h> For Further Study : <p> a .

@@35723397 @4723397/ <h> Order and Structure of the Books in the Writings <p> Yesterday in our previous discussion , we were beginning to discuss why and how and what is the Hebrew Bible arrangement . We talked about where it came from , what is its significance , how it is arranged and that kind of business . We talked a little bit about the Law being covenant , the Prophets being covenant history and the Writings being covenant life . And in the Prophets we have Former and Latter Prophets . We have what I call history and homiletics . <p> Joshua through Kings constitutes what some people call the Deuteronomic history of Israel . It is really the living out of the covenant of Deuteronomy in the land and what that is like . At the beginning of Joshua the people of God enter the Promised Land . At the end of the Kings they are kicked out . That history , that chunk of time , is characterized basically by life in the land . It is book-ended by going in and getting booted out . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Twelve ) constitute an interpretation . It is the authoritative interpretation of that history . It basically says that Yahweh is faithful , Israel is unfaithful and be prepared now to experience the covenant curses laid out in Deuteronomy . But there is hope . When we get to the book of Deuteronomy , especially Deuteronomy 32 , we will show you exactly how that hope is to come . <p> I will argue " and I will just give you this as an advance statement " that Deuteronomy 29-31 is the preface or the introduction to Joshua through Kings . Everything that happens in Joshua through 2 Kings is set forth in terms of the macro-history . It is set forth in those few chapters , Deuteronomy 29-31 . <p> Then we have Deuteronomy 32 : the Song of Yahweh or the Song of Moses ( however you want to call it ) . Deuteronomy 32 is the sermon text of the Prophets . All of the Prophets ( Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel and The Twelve ) are preaching various sermons , but on only one sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found first in Deuteronomy 32 . Everything they are doing is there . That is the key . If you do not understand Deuteronomy 32 , you really do not understand Isaiah to Malachi . You can not . It is impossible . But rarely do I hear anyone ever arguing in that way . But we are going to argue in that way . I am going to try and show you how knowing Deuteronomy 32 helps you with Isaiah through Malachi . It is like having the answer key before the problem . That is a helpful thing . It kind of helps you know how to work with the problem . That is right . That is exactly right . It is like Jeopardy . <p> If Joshua through Kings is primarily about life in the land , Isaiah through Malachi is really about getting kicked out of it . It is about life in exile : either preparing for exile with the earlier prophets , being in exile during the exilic prophets or reflecting on that exile in the post-exilic prophets . So we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Latter Prophets as life in exile and the interpretation of that life . <h> I. The Writings <p> The Writings , I am going to argue , have twelve books . There are six books , Psalms to Ecclesiastes , and six more books , Lamentations to Chronicles . In some measure , I think they have been grouped similarly to the Former and Latter Prophets . That is to say Psalms through Ecclesiastes is dealing with issues related to life in the land . It is a theology of life , we could say , even in the church . We have got praise and worship , wisdom , how to conduct our self with marriage . We can even say that the book of Ecclesiastes is how do we deal adequately with a postmodern worldview . That is a very appropriate kind of question for that book . Then we have Lamentations to Chronicles , which is really about life in exile . I can show you how some of that works in a little bit . We will do that as we talk about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief rundown of how these books may work . I can kind of tell you a story . These are the twelve books . This is their order in the Writings . I just want to tell you a way in which you can remember them . There is no part of Scripture that says this is exactly how it is ordered . What I am doing is I am looking at the books . I am looking at their position in the canon . I am looking at what they are doing and how they are related . I am estimating , surmising , postulating , putting together how I think those books have been structured . You have already had a hint with how I treated Ruth yesterday . You can see it from there . <h> a . The First Six Books : Covenant Life <p> In these first six books of the Writings , we are dealing with covenant life " covenant history , covenant life . It is covenant life in the Writings . How do I think and live in light of the covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant life is that covenant life is about worshiping your Creator and Redeemer . And so you have this book of Psalms " the book of worship . <h> 1 . Psalms <p> In the book of Psalms , there are a number of different types of Psalms . You have your rock and roll , your blues , your country music , your gospel , all that kind of business . All that business is there , but in a different format . That is to say , there are different types of songs in the book of Psalms . There are at least ten different types . You have got hymns , lament songs , thanksgiving songs , wisdom psalms , torah psalms and royal psalms . You have got psalms of ascent and the hallelujah psalms . Then you have different groupings , such as the psalms of Asaph . You have doxologies . There are all kinds of different things at work there . <p> But this is an interesting thing . In terms of the dominant psalm type " what is the dominant type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think something like hymns or thanksgiving songs or something like that . We would think something happy and clappy . But that is not the case . The number one type of psalm in the book of Psalms is lament . Maybe , there are a number of different reasons to wonder why that is . To some degree , that is due to David 's authorship . He was the anointed king of Israel . He was always oppressed and afflicted in the midst of that . From the very start he was anointed and then , all of a sudden , he is confronting a giant , the enemy of God , in the next chapter . Then , not only is he confronting the enemy of God as Goliath , but also Saul is always trying to stab him with a spear . Then he has other enemies chasing him . Then he has problems with his marriages and problems with his children trying to take over his country . He has problems with other guys throwing rocks at him . He has all kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lament is not all bad news . There is actually an acronym for learning the structure . Laments are actually structured and have a specific structure . The structure is ACT SAD : address , complaint , trust , salvation , assurance and declarative praise . It is not all moaning and groaning . It is not all : " Woe is me . " Laments always have an expression of divine trust and , in the end , divine deliverance . Lament is the number one type of psalm . <p> In some sense David was a man who lived between the times . He was the anointed king of Israel . It was supposed to be all good for him . If anyone should have lived the good life , it should have been David . But he was constantly afflicted . He lived in a time where he had the promises of God , but the unfulfilled promises of God . It is very much like the time we live in . We live in " the already and not-yet " eschatological period ( as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus has come . He has paid for our sins . He has given us His Spirit . But we still live in this fallen , broken world . We have not reached the eschaton yet . We are not in the time period characterized by Revelation 21 and 22 . And so we have good reason to lament . We will suffer in this current world . The book of Psalms becomes a very appropriate book for the Christian because , like David , we live between the times . <h> 2 . Job <p> You may remember yesterday , when I talked about the book of Proverbs , Proverbs 31 , the exposition of a woman of valor , and then the example of a woman of valor in Ruth . It is the same thing here . One of the things I think is going on in the Writings is there is this pattern : there is exposition followed by illustration . If the number one genre or type of psalm in the book of Psalms is lament , it does not surprise me that Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffered for righteousness sake " suffered , not for anything he had done , but simply to prove the value of God as an object of worship , with or without riches " Job is the one who suffered . And so we have suffering , and then the illustration of what does it look like to be someone who suffers simply for the name or the reputation of the God they worship . So you have teaching and illustration . <h> 3 . Proverbs and Ruth <p> Then you have Proverbs . Now that I know that I am to worship God and that I am going to suffer in this world , how do I go about living wisely in this world ? Should I live like a fool or a wise man ? The book of Proverbs argues that you should live like a wise person . The climax of Hebrew wisdom , which originally was written for young boys , is get a good wife . Chapter 31 says : this is what she looks like . And then the book of Ruth is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration ; exposition and then illustration . <h> 4 . Song of Songs <p> And then , of course , how can you leave out Song of Songs . It 's like there is this kind of the " holy trinity " of marriage in the Old Testament . Proverbs 31 shows this is what a good wife looks like . Ruth is the illustration of that wife . And Song of Songs is how to treat a good wife or how to enjoy a good wife . <p> The Song of Songs is a tricky book . There are a lot of different interpretational options . They range from super-literal , supersonic literal , erotic , NC17 kind of love poetry to it is this beautiful , allegorical description of the relationship between God and Israel , Yahweh and Israel , or Jesus and the church . Let us just say there are probably truths in both of those camps . Somewhere in the middle , we need to figure out what is going on there . When we have a chance to talk about the Song of Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will give you my interpretation of that and what I think is going on there . For now , I will give you my short version of it . I do think that Solomon is writing it . I do think he is writing it about a woman , but a woman he tried to get into his harem who would not go . She was tempted by wealth , by fame , by being in Solomon 's great and royal court . But she chose rather to be with her shepherd boy , so she would not be one of a thousand , but the very own special one of one man . So she gave up wealth and honor and fame for love . <p> In some sense , Proverbs and Ruth are kind of from the male perspective : What am I looking for ? Song of Songs , I think , is written for the female perspective : What type of man should I be looking for ? What should I be looking for in a relationship ? Perhaps when we get there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ecclesiastes <p> Then Ecclesiastes , the last book of the Writings in that first section : life in the land . It deals with what I would call anti-wisdom . The key phrase for understanding the book of Ecclesiastes occurs over and over and over again . It is not " vanity of vanities " . That is the result of the world view . The key phrase for the book of Ecclesiastes that occurs everywhere is " under the sun . " It is a life " under the sun " . At the end of this book in the Writings , the author puts forward the question : " All right , if you do not want to live a life in this land in covenant with our God , what is your other option ? It is a life " under the sun " . It is a life in this world with only the things you can see going on here . That life is essentially " vanity of vanities " " complete vanity . <p> There is nothing to be gained . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some advantage to being wise , but in the end you both bite the dust . You both return to dust . So really , at the end of the day , there is no advantage to being a fool over being a wise person . Is there an advantage to being rich or poor ? There is a little bit of an advantage to being rich . But , in some sense , being rich is worse because you labor and you labor and you labor , you die and you leave everything you worked for to someone else and that person could be a fool . I am paraphrasing here some of the things . But that is what is going on . So you might as well be a foolish poor person and have a lot of fun in life . That is better than be a wise rich person because all your work and effort is just going to get flushed down the toilet ( or thrown into the trash heap or the ash heap ) when it is all said and done . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Look , I have been presenting the worldview like this , but that is a very depressing worldview . This world is not about life ' under the sun ' . We are about the One who created the heavens and the earth , who has redeemed us . It is about life ' over the sun ' . Life is not just simply what you can see . There is that invisible world out there that governs us . So fear God and keep His commands . " That is the conclusion there . <p> You can tell Ecclesiastes has a different worldview . In Ecclesiastes , for example , they can say : " There is nothing new under the sun . " But then , how can the Lord say through Isaiah the prophet : " Behold , I am doing something new , something never done before . No one has ever talked about it . Behold , I am announcing it to you now before it springs forth , so you can know that no one else has planned this . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ecclesiastes " there is nothing new under the sun " . Who is right ? Both of them are right according to the worldview they are operating on . The postmodern world view says " there is nothing new under the sun " . But in God 's community , anything is possible . Lots of new stuff is happening every day . <p> Also , in the book of Ecclesiastes it says : " What is crooked can not be made straight . " But in Isaiah it says : " Make straight the highway . Raise up the valleys . Make a straight highway . " So it is saying : " Make what is crooked straight . " It is all about worldview at this point . <p> Worldview is not a new and modern science . It is at least as old as Solomon . He is operating off the same parameters . Solomon is basically saying , at the end of the day , the only other option besides this option is one that is highly depressing . It is vanity of vanities , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide mantra . It is not worth anything . <p> Those are the first six books and I think that is not a bad story . You could tell your friends or tell your kids : " Look , here are six books . It is about living life under the covenant relationship with God . How do you live a life in covenant with God ? " In some sense you can also ask : " How do you live a life in the church ? " We can not really say " in the land " anymore , because God 's people no longer live in " the physical land " " and they will not again , I would argue , until Revelation 21 and 22 . But I recognize that is a disputed reality . <h> b . The Second Six Books : Life in Exile <p> Now , the latter six books are about life in exile : because Israel spent much more time in exile than they did in the land " especially if you count spiritual exile . They nearly never got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for Israel to get out of Egypt , but it was hard to get Egypt out of Israel . " That is one way of saying how they lived . The second set of six books in the Writings constitute , to some degree , to some measure , a life in exile . It means this : What is exile about ? How should I live in the midst of that exile ? <h> 1 . Lamentations <p> It kicks off with Lamentations , which describes in detail the fall of Jerusalem , when Nebuchadnezzar came in 587-586BC . He smoked that city . He tore down the gates and burned the temple . It was over for Israel . The theocracy was over , and all that business . It was just done . That is the fall of Israel , as we know it . It is very sad . There are encouraging parts there that are calls to faithfulness and remembrances of God 's fidelity . But fundamentally , it is a book that laments . It describes the fall of Jerusalem and the tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not live in the land anymore , the question becomes : How do I live a life of faithfulness ? The first answer is Esther . The first answer is : How does a woman live a life of faithfulness in exile ? Basically , it is faithfulness unto death ? That is the answer : faithfulness unto death . Esther , of course , became the wife of the foreign king . She had a high political office . You would think capitulation was going to be at the forefront of her mind . But , by God 's providence , she actually helped to orchestrate , in God 's planning , the saving of His people in that exile . She was used in their protection and provision . But , do you remember ? She had that line : " If I perish , I perish . " She knew that her job in that time was to be faithful even unto death . <h> 3 . Daniel <p> Then Daniel represents : What does it look like for a man to be faithful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female . But I am just using them that way because of the main character in Esther is a female and the main character in Daniel is a male . Daniel , remember , has the same line . In fact , in Daniel this line comes several times . They are going to go on this vegetarian and water diet and their attitude is : " If they die , they die . " There is the lion 's den . Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego say : " Hey you can kill us if you want , but we are not going to bow down to that idol . " That kind of thing happens over and over again . Those guys were saying this . The famous line in the book of Daniel is : " God can save us from any disaster you put before us . But if not , we will not capitulate . " " But if not " Again , it is faithfulness unto death in the book of Daniel . That is just by way of brief survey . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I described briefly in the last lecture . We will actually talk about that when I talk about what we are going to call canonical seams and how the canon is sewn or stitched together . But Ezra to Chronicles focuses on , or is all about , the return from exile . Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus , in 538BC , that the exiles may return . That is in 538 or 536 . Chronicles concludes with the exact same decree in 538 or 536 . The interesting thing is , when you start in Ezra and you read all of Nehemiah and then you get to Chronicles you finish in the same place . At the end , you have not gone anywhere . You are back where you started . That is part of the story . That is part of the theology of Ezra , Nehemiah and Chronicles . We will talk about that more when we actually speak about the specific books in their canonical contexts . <h> II . Some Implications of the Hebrew Canonical Structure <p> That is a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Prophets are our covenant history " both history and homiletics , life in the land and life in exile . The Writings are covenant life " how do I think and live in light of the covenant ? Likewise with the Writings , there are life in the land and life in exile . You can think of those broad categories . That is really a simple arrangement , but it is theologically profound . It helps you understand the basic purpose of the book just by knowing what part of the canon it is . <p> That is why I can say , when I think about teaching Sunday school or preaching in church or even talking with friends , about things down here in these Writings . These are about how you think and live in light of the covenant . We are supposed to try to emulate these people 's lives . Ruth is someone we are supposed to emulate . You can dare to be a Ruth ( if we use that language that is popular ) . You can dare to be an Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can dare to be an Ezra . That is all right . Those books are written for us as examples of how to live and think . They present this exemplary pattern of living . <p> But up here in the Law or Former Prophets I would be afraid to say that . I would be hermeneutically inaccurate to say : " Dare to be a Moses or dare to be a David . " David is a hot , popular guy . Everyone wants to be like David . He was of no account but became king . He had lots of wives . Who does not want to be good with a sword and kill a lot of people ? That is right : Dare to be a David . What are the giants in your life that you need to slay ? That is how we interpret him . Every Sunday School flannel-graph curriculum treats David as someone to imitate . <p> Let us take that to its logical conclusion , just to have a little bit of fun . David had multiple wives " does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I am going to be fair , I am going to be fair . Dare to be a David . Or David killed thousands and thousands of Philistines " is it your job now to go find the descendants of the Philistines and to kill them with a sword ? Dare to be a David . <p> Brief Response to a Question . <p> Never in the Bible is it OK to have more than one wife . Never . It is like divorce . It is permitted in some contexts and cases and stuff like that . But I would say it is permitted begrudgingly because of our own stupid fallen sinfulness . <p> Here is the thing . Dare to commit adultery . Dare to be like David . Dare to take a census . There are all those kinds of things . Every time David sinned , people died around him . It is not a very good thing . So you can not really do that consistently . Dare to be a Samson . Slay your neighbors with a jawbone of an ass . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to be used that way . <p> That is when we get to this thing . We think the Bible is written about us . We do not really understand why those stories are there . We do not really know how God is advancing His kingdom and how it relates to us covenantally . We do not really know how we fit into that history and are part of that history . That is my history . <p> One of the things that are popular today is the genealogy websites and doing family background and family research . You learn a lot of history by doing that , because you are intimately connected to the players . It is different when you are talking about European history . You do not know anybody . None of your family is there . But if you happen to be a part of that history , there are certain things that become more interesting to you . <p> If you are , by faith , a child of Abraham , this is your history . I do not dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes . That is not set for me as something to emulate . But I am thankful for that history because that determines and shows me who I am and where I have come from . That is a lot of how this is . These books function in different ways . In some places you are to dare to be someone or something . You are , in fact , commanded to . Paul says : " Imitate me . " So dare to be a Paul . You can do that . <p> But , in some sense , when you get to " What would Jesus do ? " " I see the WWJD tee-shirts or wristbands " that is a little bit more difficult . Jesus would walk on water , feed five thousand and cast out demons . I can not do any of that . I can not dare to be a Jesus . In fact , that would just be a crushing way of me feeling like I am completely worthless and I can not do what Jesus did . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I can not impute my righteousness to you . I can not ascend to heaven and be Lord over all the heavens and the earth . Matter of fact , it is a good thing I can not . No one would want that plan . <p> So you have got to be careful how you use these things . You can not treat the Bible with a monolithic hermeneutic or a single interpretational scheme . That is why we have debates . I do not know if you are familiar with this , but in some circles we have really strong debates about how to preach from certain texts . On the one hard-core side , there is the Dutch redemptive-historical dudes who would say : " Never apply the text . " Then on the other side , they say : " Well , the only thing I do is apply the text , because all I want to know is how to live tomorrow . " There is something in the middle . They are both right . There are things in the Bible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come from and what God is doing in history and how we fit into that plan . But there are also things in the Bible that say : This is helpful ; do this ; this is nice ; this is good ; that kind of thing . So there is both practical instruction and worldview painting text . <p> Unless you know how the Bible is structured , you are never going to know how to first approach the text . So people with a monolithic hermeneutic will either be " dare to be a David " all over or they will be what you could call a Christocentric , theocentric , theology-centric kind of person all the time . The latter think it is all about what you think and know about the Bible . It is nothing about how you obey or believe or cherish . Those kinds of things . <p> This kind of model in the Hebrew Bible is very helpful to me , because it tells me exactly how I need to approach those books in each case . I get a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible this way . In the English Bible , the problem is that arrangement is completely gone . The hermeneutical arrangement has been destroyed in the English Bible . That is why I do not like following that arrangement . <p> I will go on and show you some more things about it . But I will just tell you briefly , by way of summary , that in terms of the Hebrew Bible arrangement , the arrangement is not fundamentally chronological It is not fundamental by genre . It is not fundamentally by authorship . There is some of that in there . I am not denying , for example , that the first five books were written by Moses . I believe strongly that those books are Mosaic in authorship . So there is an authorship arrangement in the Hebrew Bible . But that is not the primary structuring element behind the divisions and the arrangement . <h> III . The Source of the Arrangement of the Hebrew Canonical Structure <p> Where do we get this final arrangement ? That is a question that I will deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wisdom of Ben Sirach " I showed you that prologue " that there was a threefold division in the Bible . In 132BC , he was writing about a tradition that was already very old . So , let us just say , in 200BC we already had a threefold division of the Hebrew Bible . We also know that Jesus , Paul and Luke , in their lives , ministries or writings , affirm that threefold division . We know that the Babylonian Talmud maintains that tradition " that same threefold division . It is also the division and the sections that are adopted in the first Rabbinic Bible , the Bomberg Bible , 1500 . We know that is still today the Jewish Bible arrangement . If you get a Jewish Publication Society Bible , its arrangement is the one on the right of your handout , not the one on the left . <p> The honest answer to that question is that we have no idea who did it . I can only surmise that it was done under God 's providential care " that He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that was significant for us . We can interpret that final form and see what the significance is . <p> Can we speculate ? Sure . Perhaps it was Ezra or Nehemiah . Ezra was a great scribe . Nehemiah was doing all of the work at that time at the very end of their history . Perhaps Ezra and Nehemiah put the books together in this final form . Perhaps it was Judas Maccabeus . He would have been a good candidate . Judas Maccabeus was one of the guys who lived in that inter-testamental period . If you just read 1 and 2 Maccabees , you will read about some of his history . We know that he collected Biblical manuscripts . He might have been the one to do that . We just do not know . We do not know at all . <p> But we do have early evidence . We have evidence from Ben Sirach or the Wisdom of Ben Sirach or Ecclesiasticus . We have the New Testament that recognizes this threefold division . We have the Babylonian Talmud , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the Rabbinical Bible adopted that structure in the 1500s . It is still the order printed in my Hebrew Bible today . It is actually much more common than we think . But most of us American Protestants have never really had the opportunity to see the other option . We just go to Sunday School , learn the order and drive home and have lunch and take nap . That is our normal thing . <h> IV . Should we Follow the Hebrew Arrangement for our Bibles ? <p> Should we follow this arrangement for our Bibles ? My statement earlier , when we asked that question about the arrangement of the English Bible , was " no " . We should not follow the English Bible arrangement . If I were in charge of the publishing house ( which I am not , by God 's grace ) our Bibles would be printed using the Hebrew Bible order . If it was good enough for Jesus , it is good enough for me . We know roughly what Jesus ' Bible looked like . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest attested order . It is the order recognized by Jesus , Paul and Luke , at least in the associations of the writings that we have in Luke and Acts . It matches the structure of the books presented to us in the New Testament . Again , you have not seen my outline or chart or my boxes yet , but you will . <p> Also , the structure of the books , both in its divisions and arrangements , provide interpretive clues or hermeneutical lenses for how we should properly understand , interpret and apply the individual books . That seems to be more important than knowing the genre and chronology , to me . It is not that genre and chronology is not important in the English Bible arrangement . It is . But , to me , this other the principles for the Hebrew Bible structure seems to be more important . <p> Let me just read my little paragraph here . I believe that the word of God is not an encyclopedia or a dictionary for issues or problems facing me in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not primarily a therapeutic guide of self-help . It is not a love letter , a self-help manual or a guide to the history of the ancient Near East . It is a book that governs our relationship to the living God with whom we are in a covenantal relationship . It is the book that governs our relationship with the living God . It is a covenantal book . It is testamental : Old Testament , New Testament . This means that it is a document that binds or guides or structures a relationship between two parties . We have got to interpret it that way . <h> V. Understanding the Covenantal Structure of our Bibles <p> So here is what I have . Now we are going to talk about : How do you then explain all this in a way that makes sense to me ? You have told me about the bits , the pieces , the parts , the nuts and the bolts . You have told me where we have come from and where we are going . Now the question is : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am going to try and argue with eight boxes jammed together in this little thing . I am going to show you how it fits together in a way that is very simple , easy to reproduce , easy to repeat . I am happy to have you do it in any kind of context you get a chance to do . <p> Before I explain my chart , perhaps it is important that I explain what I am going to do here . I am going to argue that the threefold division of the Hebrew Old Testament is covenantal . That is to say , its macro-structuring element , in both the Old Testament and New Testament , is covenant . This is demonstrated in their arrangement . The next big question is : How does this covenantal canon look ? How does it work ? How does it fit together " especially as it relates to the New Testament ? <p> This part of the lecture will be like putting together a puzzle . To do that , we will always begin with the outside edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The first thing you do with a puzzle is you take it out , spread it on the table , turn all the pieces so the picture is up . Then you put the picture up , so you will know what you are looking at . The first thing you do is you put on the edges . What I am going to be doing now is putting on those edges so you can see how all the parts and pieces fit together . <h> a . Personal Experience at Seminary <p> Let me tell you how I got here . I went to a seminary , a great seminary that I loved , but it was much more eclectic than the environment that we are in now . The seminary I teach in now is a Reformed Seminary . We have got Southern Baptists and Anglicans and Methodists and Presbyterians and all kinds of people , but fundamentally the faculty shares one basic Biblical worldview . If you go through the curriculum here , you will have , with minor variations , the presentation of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldview as the theology guys or the Bible guys . When we talk about practical theology , we are talking about it from the same Biblical worldview as the theology guys or the exegesis guys . There are great advantages to that in an educational system to have a unified education . I prefer teaching in that environment . That is why I teach here . I think it is a good environment to teach in . <p> However , there are also advantages to the environment that I grew up in theologically in terms of my education . It was very eclectic . The theology guys were of one theological stripe and my Bible guys were of a little bit of a different one and the practical theology guys were of completely different one . And even within those , there were warring factions " for example , even within the Old Testament or the New Testament departments . They had different worldviews on how to think about the Old Testament , the history , the relationship between the Old and New , the covenants , all that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education with regard to the Bible . <p> When I graduated and left seminary , I was fundamentally confused . I spent the next two years trying to put all my broken pieces back together again . It was like : all the king 's horses and all the king 's men and here I was trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again . I was just convinced that the Bible must somehow be unified . I do not have sixty-six books , or however you count based upon the Hebrew or English Bible . I really have one book . I say that that book is the word of God . I am attributing divine authorship to it . Is there a divine design ? So I began to really work hard to try to see how it all works . <h> b . The Influence of Meredith Kline <p> The seed bed of my thinking comes from Meredith Kline 's book , The Structure of Biblical Authority . He talks about the importance of the covenant and understanding what a covenant is and a covenant document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically , in the ancient world , if something is covenantal it is by definition canonical . That means this . A document in the ancient world that was covenantal had certain things with it . This is a simplification , but it is good enough for us . For example , it had a final documentary clause that said : " Cursed are you if you add one word to this document or if you take away one word from this document . " That represents an authoritative closing of the canon . Do not change it . They sealed it up , made two copies and gave one to the king and one to the vassal with whom he was making the covenant . There are Hittite Treaties . There are also Akkadian Treaties , Neo-Assyrian Treaties and stuff like that . There are lots of examples . For this lecture , we are not going to really go into that business in detail . The Hittite Suzerainty Treaty of the second millennium B.C. would be your best bet . That is where we get the most correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of correspondence , but the format had shifted by the first millennium B.C. and so there are some differences . <p> Again , I am indebted to Meredith Kline for much of this thinking at this point . For example , the book of Deuteronomy follows the basic pattern of the second millennium B.C. Hittite Suzerainty Treaty . If you are interested in that kind of study " if you want to see what Deuteronomy is about and why is it structured the way it is " read Meredith Kline 's The Treaty of the Great King . It is a commentary , in some sense , on the book of Deuteronomy . It is a great book . I believe that you can never understand really Deuteronomy without having first read that book . In all of its fullness and what is going on , it just helps so much . <p> I would say I am indebted to Kline for many , many things in the way I think about the Bible and Biblical theology and protology and eschatology . One of the things Kline did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is covenantal , it is canonical . It is only canonical to the degree to which it is covenantal . That is where I then came up with : Well , if that is covenant then that is covenant history and that is covenant life . Now I have rooted all the genres in covenant , covenant history and covenant life . They are all rooted in that reality . <p> Then , Kline , in his book The Structure of Biblical Authority , started to speak about how all the different genres are perhaps related to the different parts of a covenant treaty . For example , in a covenant document of the second millennium B.C. , there is a preamble which identifies who is the great king and who is the vassal . There is a historical prologue that documents their previous history . There are stipulations which govern the behavior : this is what the king will do and this what the vassal will do . There are blessings and curses : if you obey , good ; if you disobey , bad , very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read it , seal it . There is a blood oath to seal the document " the spilling of blood , usually of animals , to seal that . <p> He started saying : " Hey , look . There are things like that . There is preamble , describing who is God and who are these Israelites . That is really what the book of Genesis is about . He is the Creator and these Israelites are from the seed that has been promised . That represents , pretty much , the historical prologue as well . Then you get the famous thing : " I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt . " That is now how He defines Himself . That is a shorthand expression given to you : the preamble ( " I am the Lord your God " ) and historical prologue ( " who brought you out of the land of Egypt " ) . Stipulations follow : " thou shalt not " . Then there is : if you do , this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> Our laws are related to that . Our history is related to that . Praise and lament are reflections on that . He started describing it like an octopus . There is the Bible with its fundamental genre , covenant . Then you had all the different genres as the tentacles of the octopus . You had a history , wisdom , praise and lament . You had law and all this kind of business . You had all these tentacles . <p> Then he did one other thing in that book which was very cool . He talked about the Old Testament origins of the gospel genre . I may have mentioned this earlier . For a long time , we are really befuddled by the genre of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . This whole focus on a person 's life ( His birth , His death , His life , His teachings , all that kind of business ) just appeared to be , in terms of our Greek worldview thinking , a new genre of literature . Of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would constitute the need for some kind of new genre . If there was ever a time for the creation of a new genre , I would argue that that was it . But he suggested that perhaps we just look to our Old Testament Exodus . There are a lot of things in Exodus that remind me , in terms of genre , of the gospels. <h> c . The Development of my Chart <p> That is what got me thinking . Here I have this octopus . I have got this great covenantal octopus with all the tentacles down here " all the different types of genre . Then I have this initial contact between the gospels and Exodus and thinking Old and New . Then I just sat down . I will never forget this I sat down with a piece of paper with my Hebrew Bible , and then my English Bible for New Testament on one side . I started to ask : What connections are there ? Is there any parallel ? At that moment , the light bulb , for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was about 25 or 26 . It was just a few years ago . <p> The first people I ever shared it with was my mother and my grandmother . I will never forget sitting at the table at my mom 's house , with my mom and grandma and saying : " What do you think about this ? " And they were saying : " Where did you get this ? I have never heard it . It makes sense to me . " It is always good to be affirmed by your family . That was the moment in which I said : " I have got to track this down somehow . I have got to track this down . " And so I have been now , for ten or eleven years , working hard on trying to put this together . This is what I am about to show you . You are going to think : " Ten or eleven years ? I can explain that in an hour to someone , or less . " But though this is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes a long time for me to weave through the chaos of my brain . So here is where we go . <h> d . Drawing the Chart <p> Now to do it , we are going to deal with eight boxes . This is the handout that is available to you . Most of you should have it . If you do not have the handout , I hope it will be available online or through PDF or whatever , so you can get it . I am sure they will have it with these lectures online . You can draw this on a napkin . You can draw this on a business card . It is not a complicated outline . So you need eight boxes arranged in that way . If you are listening to this , the first thing you need to do is to draw a big rectangle that takes up the primary area of a piece of paper . The paper is oriented in the landscape or the horizontal fashion . You divide that big rectangle into six equal boxes . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then two other lines , creating a total of six boxes . When you make those two other lines vertically , the first is about one-third of the way through , and then the second is two-thirds of the way through . You see that ? I am overly describing it for the recording . Then you need two more boxes because that is only six so far . So at each end of the rectangle , you are going to draw two more boxes in the center " right here and right here . <p> This is an x-ray of your Bible . If you have ever x-rayed anything , you can see the bones . This is your canonical structure right here . If you x-rayed your Bible , this is what you would see : eight boxes . I think , just for the sake of making it easier for those who will just be listening to this , let us number our boxes . Do you mind doing that ? We are going to be mathematicians about this . We are going to start with zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box on the far right is going to be seven . Then the three lower boxes in the original rectangle of six are going to be one , two and three . Then four , five and six will be the upper register of the rectangle . So , we have eight boxes , but we are going to number them zero through seven . <p> The reason I am going to do that is because , when I talk about creation later , we are going to jack this thing up on its side . That is the structure of creation . Then we are going to do days one , two , three , four , five , six and seven and that will make perfect sense . I hope to get to this specifically when I talk about Genesis 1-2 . The arrangement of the Hebrew Bible , the arrangement of your entire Christian Bible , is set forth for you in Genesis 1:1-2:4 . The structure of those chapters ( the way those chapters are put together ) is the way the entire Christian Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred years before the whole thing was complete . That to me is remarkable . That to me says there must be divine design . <p> What do I mean by that ? What do I mean by jacking it up ? This is how creation exists . There is day zero . That is the stuff that goes on before creation : " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the earth was formless and void and darkness hovered over the deep . " That is zero . " And God said , ' Let there be light ' . " Day one , day two , day three " one , two , three . Then you have days four , five and six . You know that days one and four are parallel , right ? Here in day one , you have light and darkness . Then here in day four , you have the sun and the moon , those things that govern the light and the darkness . Here in day two , you have the sky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and the fish , those things which live in or govern the sky and the waters . Here you have dry ground on day three . Then in day six , you have man , which is governing all of that business . So , in some sense , days one and four are parallel ; two and five are parallel ; and three and six are parallel . And then you have day seven where it all comes to a conclusion and God enthrones himself as the Sabbath King . <p> That is the order of the Bible . You have protology in day zero and eschatology in day seven . From " form within void " to " perfect rest , completely done " . That is exactly how this is working out . That is just a sideline here on our thing . What we are going to do now is we are going to go back to our bigger chart right here : the one that is laying down horizontally on your piece of paper with boxes zero through seven . We will take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you all the contents for that box . 
@@35723399 @4723399/ <h> Jesus Christ : Galilean Ministry <p> Template:JesusNavigation <h> The Scene <p> Galilee was divided into upper Galilee and lower Galilee . It has already been remarked that upper Galilee was inhabited by a mixed population--hence called " Galilee of the Gentiles " ( Mt 4:15 ) . The highroads of commerce ran through it . It was " the way of the sea " ( the King James Version ) --a scene of constant traffic . The people were rude , ignorant , and superstitious , and were densely crowded together in towns and villages . About 160 BC there were only a few Jews in the midst of a large heathen population ; but by the time of Christ the Jewish element had greatly increased . The busiest portion of this busy district was round the Sea of Galilee , at the Northeast corner of which stood Capernaum--wealthy and cosmopolitan . In Nazareth , indeed , Jesus met with a disappointing reception ( Lu 4:16-30 ; Mt 13:54-57 ; compare Joh 4:43-45 ) ; yet in Galilee generally He found a freer spirit and greater receptiveness than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is assumed here that Jesus returned to Galilee in December , 27 AD , and that His ministry there lasted till late in 29 AD ( see " Chronology " above ) . On the two years ' scheme of the public ministry , the Passover of Joh 6:4 has to be taken as the second in Christ 's ministry--therefore as occurring at an interval of only 3 or 4 months after the return . This seems impossible in view of the crowding of events it involves in so short a time--opening incidents , stay in Capernaum ( Mt 4:13 ) , three circuits in " all Galilee " ( Mt 4:23-25 parallel ; Lu 8:1-4 ; Mt 9:35-38 ; Mr 6:6 ) , lesser journeys and excursions ( Sermon on Mount : Gadara ) ; and the dislocations it necessitates , e.g. the plucking of ears of corn ( about Passover time ) must be placed after the feeding of the 5,000 , etc . It is simpler to adhere to the three years ' scheme . <p> A division of the Galilean ministry may then fitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mission of the Twelve in Mt 10 parallel . One reason for this division is that after the Mission of the Twelve the order of events is the same in the first three evangelists till the final departure from Galilee . <p> First Period--From the Beginning of the Ministry in Galilee till the Mission of the Twelve <h> Opening Incidents <h> Healing of Nobleman 's Son <p> ( Joh 4:43-54 ) <p> From sympathetic Samaria ( Joh 4:39 ) , Jesus had journeyed to unsympathetic Galilee , and first to Cana , where His first miracle had been wrought . The reports of His miracles in Judea had come before Him ( Joh 4:45 ) , and it was mainly His reputation as a miracle-worker which led a nobleman--a courtier or officer at Herod 's court--to seek Him at Cana on behalf of his son , who was near to death . Jesus rebuked the sign-seeking spirit ( Joh 4:48 ) , but , on the fervent appeal being repeated , He bade the nobleman go his way : his son lived . The man 's prayer had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the word of Jesus ( Joh 4:50 ) , and on his way home received tidings of his son 's recovery . The nobleman , with his whole household , was won for Jesus ( Joh 4:53 ) . This is noted as the second of Christ 's Galilean miracles ( Joh 4:54 ) . <h> The Visit to Nazareth <p> ( Matthew 4:13 ; Luke 4:16-30 ) <p> A very different reception awaited Him at Nazareth , " His own country , " to which He next came . We can scarcely take the incident recorded in Lu 4:16-30 to be the same as that in Mt 13:54-58 , though Matthew 's habit of grouping makes this not impossible . The Sabbath had come , and on His entering the synagogue , as was His wont , the repute He had won led to His being asked to read . The Scripture He selected ( or which came in the order of the day ) was Isa 61:1 ff ( the fact that Jesus was able to read from the synagogue-roll is interesting as bearing on His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to amaze His hearers by declaring that this Scripture was now fulfilled in their ears ( Lu 4:21 ) . The " words of grace " he uttered are not given , but it can be understood that , following the prophet 's guidance , He would hold Himself forth as the predicted " Servant of Yahweh , " sent to bring salvation to the poor , the bound , the broken-hearted , and for this purpose endowed with the fullness of the Spirit . The idea of the passage in Isa is that of the year of jubilee , when debts were canceled , inheritances restored , and slaves set free , and Jesus told them He had come to inaugurate that " acceptable year of the Lord . " At first He was listened to with admiration , then , as the magnitude of the claims He was making became apparent to His audience , a very different spirit took possession of them . Who was this that spoke thus ? ' Was it not Joseph 's son ? ' ( Lu 4:22 ) . They were disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by working before them any of the miracles of which they had heard so much ( Lu 4:23 ) . Jesus saw the gathering storm , but met it resolutely . He told His hearers He had not expected any better reception , and in reply to their reproach that He had wrought miracles elsewhere , but had wrought none among them , quoted examples of prophets who had done the same thing ( Elijah , Elisha , Lu 4:24-28 ) . This completed the exasperation of the Nazarenes , who , springing forward , dragged Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , and would have thrown Him down , had something in the aspect of Jesus not restrained them . With one of those looks we read of occasionally in the Gospels , He seems to have overawed His townsmen , and , passing in safety through their midst , left the place ( Lu 4:28-30 ) . <h> Call of the Four Disciples <p> ( Matthew 4:17-22 ; Mark 1:16-22 ; Luke 5:1-11 ) <p> After leaving Nazareth Jesus made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thereafter seems to have been His headquarters . He " dwelt " there ( Mt 4:13 ) . It is called in Mt 9:1 , " his own city . " Before teaching in Capernaum self , however , He appears to have opened His ministry by evangelizing along the shores of the Sea of Galilee ( Mt 4:18 ; Mr 1:16 ; Lu 5:1 ) , and there , at Bethsaida ( on topographical questions , see special articles ) , He took His first step in gathering His chosen disciples more closely around Him . Hitherto , though attached to His person and cause , the pairs of fisher brothers , Simon and Andrew , James and John--these last the " sons of Zebedee " --had not been in constant attendance upon Him . Since the return from Jerusalem , they had gone back to their ordinary avocations . The four were " partners " ( Lu 5:10 ) . They had " hired servants " ( Mr 1:20 ) ; therefore were moderately well off . The time had now come when they were to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) The Draught of Fishes <p> ( Luke 5:1-9 ) <p> Luke alone records the striking miracle which led to the call . Jesus had been teaching the multitude from a boat borrowed from Simon , and now at the close He bade Simon put out into the deep , and let down his nets . Peter told Jesus they had toiled all night in vain , but he would obey His word . The result was an immense draught of fishes , so that the nets were breaking , and the other company had to be called upon for help . Both boats were filled and in danger of sinking . Peter 's cry in so wonderful a presence was , " Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord . " <h> b ) " Fishers of Men " <p> The miracle gave Jesus opportunity for the word He wished to speak . It is here that Mt and Mr take up the story . The boats had been brought to shore when , first to Simon and Andrew , afterward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mt 4:21 ; Mr 1:19 ) , the call was given : " Come ye after me , and I will make you fishers of men . " At once all was left--boats , nets , friends--and they followed Him . Their experience taught them to have large expectations from Christ . <h> At Capernaum <p> ( Matthew 4:13 ; Luke 4:31 ) <p> Jesus is now found in Capernaum . An early Sabbath--perhaps the first of His stated residence in the city--was marked by notable events . The Sabbath found Jesus as usual in the synagogue--now as teacher . The manner of His teaching is specially noticed : " He taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes " ( Mr 1:22 ) . The scribes gave forth nothing of their own . <h> a ) Christ 's Teaching <p> ( Mark 1:22,27 ; Luke 4:32 ) <p> They but repeated the dicta of the great authorities of the past . It was a surprise to the people to find in Jesus One whose wisdom , like waters from a clear fountain , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also with which Jesus spoke commanded attention . He sought support in the opinion of no others , but gave forth His statements with firmness , decision , dignity and emphasis . <h> b ) The Demoniac in the Synagogue <p> ( Mark 1:23-27 ; Luke 4:33-37 ) <p> While Jesus was teaching an extraordinary incident occurred . A man in the assembly , described as possessed by " an unclean spirit " ( Mr 1:23 ; Lu 4:33 ) broke forth in cries , addressing Jesus by name ( " Jesus , thou Nazarene " ) , speaking of Him as " the Holy One of God , " and asking " What have we to do with thee ? Art thou come to destroy us ? " The diseased consciousness of the sufferer bore a truer testimony to Christ 's dignity , holiness and power than most of those present could have given , and instinctively , but truly , construed His coming as meaning destruction to the empire of the demons . At Christ 's word , after a terrible paroxysm , from which , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon was cast out . More than ever the people were " amazed " at the word which had such power ( Mr 1:27 ) . <p> Demon-Possession : Its Reality . <p> This is the place to say a word on this terrible form of **29;85;TOOLONG with so often in the Gospels . Was it a reality ? Or a hallucination ? Did Jesus believe in it ? It is difficult to read the Gospels , and not answer the last question in the affirmative . Was Jesus , then , mistaken ? This also it is hard to believe . If there is one subject on which Jesus might be expected to have clear vision--on which we might trust His insight--it was His relation to the spiritual world with which He stood in so close rapport . Was He likely then to be mistaken when He spoke so earnestly , so profoundly , so frequently , of its hidden forces of evil ? There is in itself no improbability--rather analogy suggests the highest probability--of realms of spiritual existence outside our sensible ken . That evil should enter this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicated with that evil--that its forces should have a mind and will organizing and directing them--are not beliefs to be dismissed with scorn . The presence of such beliefs in the time of Christ is commonly attributed to Babylonian , Persian or other foreign influences . It may be questioned , however , whether the main cause was not something far more real--an actual and permitted " hour and the power of darkness " ( Lu 22:53 ) in the kingdom of evil , discovering itself in manifestations in the bodies and souls of men , that could be traced only to a supernatural cause ( see Demoniac ) . ( The present writer discusses the subject in an article in the Sunday School Times for June 4 , 1910 . It would be presumptuous even to say that the instance in the Gospels have no modern parallels . See a striking paper in Good , Words , edited by Dr. Norman MacLeod , for 1867 , on " The English Demoniac . " ) It should be noted that all diseases are not , as is sometimes affirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demonic possession is clearly maintained ( compare Mt 4:24 ; 10:1 ; 11:5 , etc . ) . Insanity , epilepsy , blindness , dumbness , etc. , were frequent accompaniments of possession , but they are not identified with it . <h> c ) Peter 's Wife 's Mother <p> ( Matthew 8:14,15 ; Mark 1:29-31 ; Luke 4:38,39 ) <p> Jesus , on leaving the synagogue , entered the house of Peter . In Mark it is called " the house of Simon and Andrew " ( 1:29 ) . Peter was married ( compare 1Co 9:5 ) , and apparently his mother-in-law and brother lived with him in Capernaum . It was an anxious time in the household , for the mother-in-law lay " sick of a fever " -- " a great fever , " as Luke the physician calls it . Taking her by the hand , Jesus rebuked the fever , which instantaneously left her . The miracle , indeed , was a double one , for not only was the fever stayed , but strength was at once restored . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <h> d ) The Eventful Evening <p> ( Matthew 8:16 ; Mark 1:32-34 ; Luke 4:40,41 ) <p> The day 's labors were not yet done ; were , indeed , scarce begun . The news of what had taken place quickly spread , and soon the extraordinary spectacle was presented of the whole city ' gathered at the door of the dwelling , bringing their sick of every kind to be healed . Demoniacs were there , crying and being rebuked , but multitudes of others as well . The Lord 's compassion was unbounded . He rejected none . He labored unweariedly till every one was healed . His sympathy was individual : " He laid his hands on every one of them " ( Lu 4:40 ) . <h> From First Galilean Circuit till the Choice of the Apostles The First Circuit <p> ( Mark 1:35-45 ; Luke 4:42-44 ; compare Matthew 4:23-25 ) <p> The chronological order in this section is to be sought in Mark and Luke ; Matthew groups for didactic purposes . The morning after that eventful Sabbath evening in Capernaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and villages of Galilee . <p> The task He set before Himself was prepared for by early , prolonged , solitary prayer ( Mr 1:35 ; many instances show that Christ 's life was steeped in prayer ) . His disciples followed Him , and reported that the multitudes sought Him . Jesus intimated to them His intention of passing to the next towns , and forthwith commenced a tour of preaching and healing " throughout all Galilee. " <h> a ) Its Scope <p> Even if the expression " all Galilee " is used with some latitude , it indicates a work of very extensive compass . It was a work likewise methodically conducted ( compare Mr 6:6 : " went round about the villages , " literally , " in a circle " ) . Galilee at this time was extraordinarily populous ( compare Josephus , Wars of the Jews , III , iii , 2 ) , and the time occupied by the circuit must have been considerable . Matthew 's condensed picture ( Mt 4:23-25 ) shows that Christ 's activity during this period was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His preaching and miracles drew enormous crowds after Him . This tide of popularity afterward turned , but much of the seed sown may have produced fruit at a later day . <h> b ) Cure of the Leper <p> ( Matthew 8:2-4 ; Mark 1:40-45 ; Luke 5:12-16 ) <p> The one incident recorded which seems to have belonged to this tour was a sufficiently typical one . While Jesus was in a certain city a man " full of leprosy " ( Lu 5:12 ) came and threw himself down before Him , seeking to be healed . The man did not even ask Jesus to heal him , but expressed his faith , " If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . " The man 's apparent want of importunity was the very essence of his importunity . Jesus , moved by his earnestness , touched him , and the man was made whole on the spot . The leper was enjoined to keep silence--Jesus did not wish to pass for a mere miracle-worker--and bade the man show himself to the priests and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal institutions ) . The leper failed to keep Christ 's charge , and published his cure abroad , no doubt much to his own spiritual detriment , and also to the hindrance of Christ 's work ( Mr 1:45 ) . <h> Capernaum Incidents <p> His circuit ended , Jesus returned to Capernaum ( Mr 2:1 ; literally , " after days " ) . Here again His fame at once drew multitudes to see and hear Him . Among them were now persons of more unfriendly spirit . Pharisees and doctors , learning of the new rabbi , had come out of " every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem " ( Lu 5:17 ) , to hear and judge of Him for themselves . The chief incidents of this visit are the two now to be noted . <h> a ) Cure of the Paralytic <p> ( Matthew 9:2-8 ; Mark 2:1-12 ; Luke 5:17-26 ) <p> In a chamber crowded till there was no standing room , even round the door , Jesus wrought the cure upon the paralytic man . The scene was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " literally , " child " ( Mr 2:5 ) , we infer that the paralytic was young , but his disablement seems to have been complete . It was no easy matter , with the doorways blocked , to get the man brought to Jesus , but his four bearers ( Mr 2:3 ) were not easily daunted . They climbed the fiat roof , and , removing part of the covering above where Jesus was , let down the man into the midst . Jesus , pleased with the inventiveness and perseverance of their faith , responded to their wish . But , first , that the spiritual and temporal might be set in their right relations , and the attitude of His hearers be tested , He spoke the higher words : " Son , thy sins are forgiven " ( Mr 2:5 ) . At once the temper of the scribes was revealed . Here was manifest evasion . Anyone could say , " Thy sins are forgiven . " Worse , it was blasphemy , for " who can forgive sins but one , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conceding to Christ the Divine dignity He claimed . Jesus perceives at once the thoughts of the cavilers , and proceeds to expose their malice . Accepting their own test , He proves His right to say , " Thy sins are forgiven , " by now saying to the palsied man , " Take up thy bed and walk " ( Mr 2:9,11 ) . At once the man arose , took his bed , and went forth whole . The multitude were " amazed " and " glorified God " ( Mr 2:12 ) . <h> b ) Call and Feast of Matthew <p> ( Matthew 9:9-13 ; Mark 2:13-17 ; Luke 5:27-32 ) <p> The call of Matthew apparently took place shortly after the cure of the paralytic man . The feast was possibly later ( compare the connection with the appeal of Jairus , Mt 9:18 ) , but the call and the feast are best taken together , as they are in all the three narratives . <p> ( 1 ) The Call . <p> Matthew is called " Levi " by Luke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark . By occupation he was a " publican " ( Lu 5:27 ) , collector of custom-dues in Capernaum , an important center of traffic . There is no reason to suppose that Matthew was not a man of thorough uprightness , though naturally the class to which he belonged was held in great odium by the Jews . Passing the place of toll on His way to or from the lake-side , Jesus called Matthew to follow Him . The publican must by this time have seen and heard much of Jesus , and could not but keenly feel His grace in calling one whom men despised . Without an instant 's delay , he left all , and followed Jesus . From publican , Matthew became apostle , then evangelist . <p> ( 2 ) The Feast . <p> Then , or after , in the joy of his heart , Matthew made a feast for Jesus . To this feast he invited many of his own class-- " publicans and sinners " ( Mt 9:10 ) . Scribes and Pharisees were loud in their remonstrances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all propriety . Narrow hearts can not understand the breadth of grace . Christ 's reply was conclusive : " They that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick , " etc . ( Mr 2:17 , etc . ) . <p> ( 3 ) Fasting and Joy . <p> Another line of objection was encountered from disciples of the Baptist . They , like the Pharisees , " fasted oft " ( Mt 9:14 ) , and they took exception to the unconstrained way in which Jesus and His disciples entered into social life . Jesus defends His disciples by adopting a metaphor of John 's own ( Joh 3:29 ) , and speaking of Himself as the heavenly bridegroom ( Mr 2:19 ) . Joy was natural while the bridegroom was with them ; then , with a sad forecast of the end , He alludes to days of mourning when the bridegroom should be taken away ( Mr 2:20 ) . A deeper answer follows . The spirit of His gospel is a free , spontaneous , joyful spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To attempt to confine His religion within the outworn forms of Judaism would be like putting a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment , or pouring new wine into old wineskins . The garment would be rent ; the wineskins would burst ( Mr 2:21,22 parallel ) . The new spirit must make forms of its own . <h> The Unnamed Jerusalem Feast <p> ( John 5 ) <p> At this point is probably to , be introduced the visit to Jerusalem to attend " a feast , " or , according to another reading , " the feast ' of the Jews , recorded in Joh 5 . The feast may , if the article is admitted , have been the Passover ( April ) , though in that case one would expect it to be named ; it may have been Purim ( March ) , only this is not a feast Jesus might be thought eager to attend ; it may even have been Pentecost ( June ) . In this last case it would succeed the Sabbath controversies to be mentioned later . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the teaching of the chapter . <h> a ) The Healing at Bethesda <p> ( John 5:1-16 ) <p> Bethesda ( " house of mercy " ) was the name given to a pool , fed by an intermittent spring , possessing healing properties , which was situated by the sheep-gate ( not " market , " the King James Version ) , i.e. near the temple , on the East Porches were erected to accommodate the invalids who desired to make trial of the waters ( the mention of the angel , Joh 5:4 , with part of 5:3 , is a later gloss , and is justly omitted in the Revised Version ( British and American ) ) . On one of these porches lay an impotent man . His infirmity was of long standing--38 years . Hope deferred was making his heart sick , for he had no friend , when the waters were troubled , to put him into the pool . Others invariably got down before him . Jesus took pity on this man . He asked him if he would be made whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cure was instantaneous ( John 5:8,9 ) . It was the Sabbath day , and as the man , at Christ 's command , took up his bed to go , he was challenged as doing that which was unlawful . The healed man , however , rightly perceived that He who was able to work so great a cure had authority to say what should and should not be done on the Sabbath . Meeting the man after in the temple , Jesus bade him " sin no more " --a hint , perhaps , that his previous infirmity was a result of sinful conduct ( John 5:14 ) . <h> b ) Son and Father <p> ( John 5:17-29 ) <h> c ) The Threefold Witness <p> ( John 5:30-47 ) <p> These stupendous claims are not made without adequate attestation . Jesus cites a threefold witness : <p> ( 1 ) the witness of the Baptist , whose testimony they had been willing for a time to receive ( Joh 5:33,15 ) ; <p> ( 2 ) the witness of the Father , who by Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; <p> ( 3 ) the witness of the Scriptures , for these , if read with spiritual discernment , would have led to Him ( Joh 5:39,45-47 ) . Moses , whom they trusted , would condemn them . Their rejection of Jesus was due , not to want of light , but to the state of the heart : " I know you , that ye have not the love of God in yourselves " ( Joh 5:42 ) ; " How can ye believe , " etc . ( Joh 5:44 ) . <h> Sabbath Controversies <p> Shortly after His return to Galilee , if the order of events has been rightly apprehended , Jesus became involved in new disputes with the Pharisees about Sabbath-keeping . Possibly we hear in these the echoes of the charges brought against Him at the feast in Judea . Christ 's conduct , and the principles involved in His replies , throw valuable light on the Sabbath institution . <p> The first dispute was occasioned by the action of the disciples in plucking ears of grain and rubbing them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath ( the note of time " second-first , " in Lu 6:1 the King James Version , is omitted in the Revised Version ( British and American ) . In any case the ripened grain points to a time shortly after the Passover ) . The law permitted this liberty ( De 23:25 ) , but Pharisaic rigor construed it into an offense to do the act on the Sabbath ( for specimens of the minute , trivial and vexatious rules by which the Pharisees converted the Sabbath into a day of wretched constraint , see Farrar 's Life of Christ , Edersheim 's Jesus the Messiah , and similar works ) . Jesus , in defending His disciples , first quotes Old Testament precedents ( David and the showbread , an act done apparently on the Sabbath , 1Sa 21:6 ; the priests ' service on the Sabbath-- " One greater than the temple " was there , Mt 12:6 ) , in illustration of the truth that necessity overrides positive enactment ; next , falls back on the broad principle of the design of the Sabbath as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual well-being : " The sabbath was made for man , " etc . ( Mr 2:27 ) . The claims of mercy are paramount . The end is not to be sacrificed to the means . The Son of Man , therefore , asserts lordship over the Sabbath ( Mr 2:28 parallel ) . <p> b ) The Man with the Withered Hand : <p> ( Matthew 12:10-14 ; Mark 3:1-6 ; Luke 6:6-11 ) <p> The second collision took place on " another sabbath " ( Lu 6:6 ) in the synagogue . There was present a man with a withered hand . The Pharisees themselves , on this occasion , eager to entrap Jesus , seem to have provoked the conflict by a question , " Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ? " ( Mt 12:10 ) . Jesus met them by an appeal to their own practice in permitting the rescue of a sheep that had fallen into a pit on the Sabbath day ( Mt 12:11,12 ) , then , bidding the man stand forth , retorted the question on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? " ( Mr 3:4 ) --an allusion to their murderous intents . On no reply being made , looking on them with holy indignation , Jesus ordered the man to stretch forth his hand , and it was at once perfectly restored . The effect was only to inflame to " madness " ( Lu 6:11 ) the minds of His adversaries , and Pharisees and Herodians ( the court-party of Herod ) took counsel to destroy Him ( Mr 3:6 parallel ) . <p> c ) Withdrawal to the Sea : <p> ( Matthew 12:15-21 ; Mark 3:7-9 ) <p> Jesus , leaving this scene of unprofitable conflict , quietly withdrew with His disciples to the shore , and there continued His work of teaching and healing . People from all the neighboring districts flocked to His ministry . He taught them from a little boat ( Mr 3:9 ) , and healed their sick . Mt sees in this a fulfillment of the oracle which is to be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve : <p> ( Matthew 10:1-4 ; Mark 3:13-19 ; Luke 6:12-16 ; Ac 1:13 ) <p> The work of Jesus was growing on His hands , and friends and enemies were rapidly taking sides . The time accordingly had come for selecting and attaching to His person a definite number of followers--not simply disciples--who might be prepared to carry on His work after His departure . This He did in the choice of twelve apostles . The choice was made in early morning , on the Mount of Beatitudes , after a night spent wholly in prayer ( Lu 6:12 ) . <p> a ) The Apostolic Function : <p> b ) The Lists : <p> Four lists of the apostles are given--in Matthew , Mark , Luke , and Ac ( 1:13 , omitting Judas ) . The names are given alike in all , except that " Judas , the son ( or brother ) of James " ( Lu 6:16 ; Ac 1:13 ) is called by Mt Lebbaeus , " and by Mr Thaddaeus . " The latter names are cognate in meaning and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Tolmai ) is probably the Nathanael of Joh 1:47 ( compare 21:2 ) . The epithet " Cananaean " ( Mt 10:4 ; Mr 3:18 ) marks " Simon " as then or previously a member of the party of the Zealots ( Lu 6:15 ) . In all the lists Peter , through his gifts of leadership , stands first ; Judas Iscariot , the betrayer , stands last . There is a tendency to arrangement in pairs : Peter and Andrew ; James and John ; Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew ; lastly , James , the son of Alpheus , Judas , son or brother of James , Simonthe Zealot and Judas Iscariot . The list contains two pairs of brothers ( three , if " brother " be read with Judas ) , and at least one pair of friends ( Philip and Nathanael ) . <p> c ) The Men : <p> All the apostles were men from the humbler ranks , yet not illiterate , and mostly comfortably circumstanced . All were Galileans , except the betrayer , whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks him as a Judean . Of some of the apostles we know a good deal ; of others very little ; yet we are warranted in speaking of them all , Judas excepted , as men of honest minds , and sincere piety . The band held within it a number of men of strongly contrasted types of character . Allusion need only be made to the impetuous Peter , the contemplative John , the matter-of-fact Philip , the cautious Thomas , the zealous Simon , the conservative Matthew , the administrative Judas . The last-named--Iscariot--is the dark problem of the apostolate . We have express testimony that Jesus knew him from the beginning ( Joh 6:64 ) . Yet He chose him . The character of Judas , when Jesus received him , was doubtless undeveloped . He could not himself suspect the dark possibilities that slept in it . His association with the apostles , in itself considered , was for his good . His peculiar gift was , for the time , of service . In choosing him , Jesus must be viewed as acting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joh 5:19 ; 17:12 ) . See special articles on the several apostles . <h> From the Sermon on the Mount through Parables second circuit <h> The Sermon on the Mount <p> The choice of the apostles inaugurates a new period of Christ 's activity . Its first most precious fruit was the delivery to the apostles and the multitudes who thronged Him as He came down from the mountain ( Lu 6:17 ) of that great manifesto of His kingdom popularly known as the Sermon on the Mount . The hill is identified by Stanley ( Sinai and Palestine , 368 ) and others with that known as " the Horns of Hattin , " where " the level place " at the top , from which Christ would come down from one of the higher horns , exactly suits the conditions of the narrative . The sick being healed , Jesus seated Himself a little higher up , His disciples near Him , and addressed the assembly ( compare Mt 7:28,29 ) . The season of the year is shown by the mention of the " lilies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words were weighty . His aim was at the outset to set forth in terms that were unmistakable the principles , aims and dispositions of His kingdom ; to expound its laws ; to exhibit its righteousness , both positively , and in contrast with Pharisaic formalism and hypocrisy . Only the leading ideas can be indicated here ( see Beatitudes ; Sermon on the Mount ; ETHICS OF JESUS ) . Matthew , as is his wont , groups material part of which is found in other connections in Luke , but it is well to study the whole in the well-ordered form in which it appears in the First Gospel . <p> a ) The Blessings : <p> ( Matthew 5:1-6 ; Luke 6:20-26 ) <p> In marked contrast with the lawgiving of Sinai , Christ 's first words are those of blessing . Passing at once to the dispositions of the heart , He shows on what inner conditions the blessings of the kingdom depend . His beatitudes ( poverty of spirit , mourning , meekness , hunger and thirst after righteousness , etc. ) reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the possession of these graces consists true godliness of character ; through them the heirs of the kingdom become the salt of the earth , the light of the world . The obligation rests on them to let their light shine ( compare Mr 4:21-23 ; Lu 8:16 ; 11:33 ) . <p> b ) True Righteousness--the Old and the New Law : <p> ( Matthew 5:17-48 ; Luke 6:27-36 ) <p> Jesus defines His relation to the old law--not a Destroyer , but a Fulfiller--and proceeds to exhibit the nature of the true righteousness in contrast to Pharisaic literality and formalism . Through adherence to the latter they killed the spirit of the law . With an absolute authority-- " But I say unto you " --Jesus leads everything back from the outward letter to the state of the heart . Illustrations are taken from murder , adultery , swearing , retaliation , hatred of enemies , and a spiritual expansion is given to every precept . The sinful thought or desire holds in it the essence of transgression . The world 's standards are again reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies and requital of good for evil . <p> c ) Religion and Hypocrisy--True and False Motive : <p> ( Matthew 6:1-18 ; compare Luke 11:1-8 ) <p> Pursuing the contrast between the true righteousness and that of the scribes and Pharisees , Jesus next draws attention to motive in religion . The Pharisees erred not simply in having regard only to the letter of the Law , but in acting in morals and religion from a false motive . He had furnished the antidote to their literalism ; He now assails their ostentation and hypocrisy . Illustrations are taken from almsgiving , prayer and fasting , and in connection with prayer the Lord 's Prayer is given as a model ( Luke introduces this in another context , Lu 11:1-4 ) . <p> d ) The True Good and Cure for Care : <p> ( Matthew 6:19-34 ; compare Luke 11:34-36 ; 12:22-34 ) <p> The true motive in religious acts is to please God ; the same motive should guide us in the choice of what is to be our supreme good . Earthly treasure is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His righteousness are to be first in our desires . The eye is to be single . The true cure for worldly anxiety is then found in trust of the heavenly Father . His children are more to God than fowls and flowers , for whom His care in Nature is so conspicuously manifest . Seeking first the kingdom they have a pledge--no higher conceivable--that all else they need will be granted along with it ( this section on trust , again , Luke places differently , 12:22-34 ) . <p> e ) Relation to the World 's Evil--the Conclusion : <p> ( Matthew 7:1-29 ; Luke 6:37-49 ; compare 11:9-13 ) : <p> Jesus finally proceeds to speak of the relation of the disciple to the evil of the world . That evil has been considered in its hostile attitude to the disciple ( Mt 5:38 ) ; the question is now as to the disciple s free relations toward it . Jesus inculcates the duties of the disciple 's bearing himself wisely toward evil--with charity , with caution , with prayer , in the spirit of ever doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard against it . The temptation is great to follow the worldly crowd , to be misled by false teachers , to put profession for practice . Against these perils the disciple is energetically warned . True religion will ever be known by its fruits . The discourse closes with the powerful similitude of the wise and foolish builders . Again , as on an earlier occasion , Christ 's auditors were astonished at His teaching , and at the authority with which He spoke ( Mt 7:28,29 ) . <h> A series of remarkable incidents are next to be noticed <p> a ) Healing of the Centurion 's Servant : <p> ( Matthew 8:1,5-13 ; Luke 7:1-10 ) <p> ( 1 ) The healing of the centurion 's servant apparently took place on the same day as the delivery of the Sermon on the Mount ( Lu 7:1,2 ) . It had been a day of manifold and exhausting labors for Jesus . A walk of perhaps 7 miles brought Him back to Capernaum , the crowds accompanying . Yet no sooner , on His return , does He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I will come and heal him . " The suppliant was a Roman centurion--one who had endeared himself to the Jews ( Lu 7:5 ) --and the request was for the healing of a favorite servant , paralyzed and tortured with pain . First , a deputation sought Christ 's good offices , then , when Jesus was on the way , a second message came , awakening even Christ 's astonishment by the magnitude of its faith . The centurion felt he was not worthy that Jesus should come under his roof , but let Jesus speak the word only , and his servant would be healed . " I have not found so great faith , " Jesus said , " no , not in Israel . " The word was spoken , and , on the return of the messengers , the servant was found healed . <p> b ) The Widow of Nain 's Son Raised : <p> ( Luke 7:11-17 ) <p> The exciting events of this day gathered so great a crowd round the house where Jesus was as left Him no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious for His health , sought to restrain Him ( Mr 3:20,21 ) . It was probably to escape from this local excitement that Jesus , " soon afterwards , " is found at the little town of Nain , a few miles Southeast of Nazareth . A great multitude still followed Him . Here , as He entered the city , occurred the most wonderful of the works He had yet wrought . A young man--the only son of a widowed mother--was being carried out for burial . Jesus , in compassion , stopped the mournful procession , and , in the calm certainty of His word being obeyed , bade the young man arise . On the instant life returned , and Jesus gave the son back to his mother . The amazement of the people was tenfold intensified . They felt that the old days had come back : that God had visited His people . <p> It was apparently during the journey or circuit which embraced this visit to Nain , and as the result of the fame it brought to Jesus ( Lu 7:17,18 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reply to John ) , that the embassy was sent from the Baptist in prison to ask of Jesus whether He was indeed He who should come , or would they look for another . <p> c ) Embassy of John 's Disciples--Christ and His Generation : <p> ( Matthew 11:2-30 ; Luke 7:18-35 ) <p> It was a strange question on the lips of the forerunner , but is probably to be interpreted as the expression of perplexity rather than of actual doubt . There seems no question but that John 's mind had been thrown into serious difficulty by the reports which had reached him of the work of Jesus . Things were not turning out as he expected . It was the peaceful , merciful character of Christ 's work which stumbled John . The gloom of his prison wrought with his disappointment , and led him to send this message for the satisfaction of himself and his disciples . <p> ( 1 ) Christ 's Answer to John . <p> If doubt there was , Jesus treated it tenderly . He did not answer directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back and tell John the things they had seen and heard--the blind receiving their sight , the lame walking , the deaf cured , the dead raised , the Gospel preached . Little doubt the Messiah had come when works like these--the very works predicted by the prophets ( Isa 35:5,6 ) --were being done . Blessed were those who did not find occasion of stumbling in Him . Jesus , however , did more . By his embassy John had put himself in a somewhat false position before the multitude . But Jesus would not have His faithful follower misjudged . His was no fickle spirit . Jesus nobly vindicated him as a prophet and more than a prophet ; yea , a man than whom a greater had not lived . Yet , even as the new dispensation was higher than the old , one " but little " in the kingdom of heaven--one sharing Christ 's humble , loving , self-denying disposition--was greater even than John ( Mt 11:11 ) . <p> ( 2 ) A Perverse People--Christ 's Grace . <p> The implied contrast between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of His own generation . The Pharisees and lawyers ( Lu 7:30 ) had rejected John ; they were as little pleased with Him . Their behavior was like children objecting to one game because it was merry , and to another because it was sad . The flood of outward popularity did not deceive Jesus . The cities in which His greatest works were wrought--Chorazin , Bethsaida , Capernaum--remained impenitent at heart . The heavier would be their judgment ; worse even than that on Tyre and Sidon , or on Sodom itself . Over against their unbelief Jesus reasserts His dignity and declares His grace ( Mt 11:25-30 ) . All authority was His ; He alone knew and could reveal the Father ( no claims in John are higher ) . Let the heavy laden come to Him , and He would give them rest ( parts of these passages appear in another connection in Lu 10:12-21 ) . <p> d ) The First Anointing--the Woman Who Was a Sinner : <p> ( Luke 7:36-50 ) <p> Yet another beautiful incident connected with this journey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a woman who was a sinner . In Nain or some other city visited by Him , Jesus was invited to dine with a Pharisee named Simon . His reception was a cold one ( Lu 7:44-46 ) . During the meal , a woman of the city , an outcast from respectable society--one , however , as the story implies , whose heart Jesus had reached , and who , filled with sorrow , love , shame , penitence , had turned from her life of sin , entered the chamber . There , bathing Christ 's feet with her tears , wiping them with her tresses , and imprinting on them fervent kisses , she anointed them with a precious ointment she had brought with her . Simon was scandalized . Jesus could not be a right-thinking man , much less a prophet , or He would have rebuked this misbehavior from such a person . Jesus met the thought of Simon 's heart by speaking to him the parable of the Two Debtors ( Lu 7:41,42 ) . Of two men who had been freely forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love his creditor most ? Simon gave the obvious answer , and the contrast between his own reception of Jesus and the woman 's passionate love was immediately pointed out . Her greater love was due to the greater forgiveness ; though , had Simon only seen it , he perhaps needed forgiveness even more than she . <h> Events at Capernaum <p> Her faith saved her and she was dismissed in peace . But again the question arose , " Who is this that even forgiveth sins ? " Luke introduces here ( Lu 8:1-4 ) a second Galilean circuit of Jesus , after the return from which a new series of exciting incidents took place at Capernaum . <p> a ) Galilee Revisited : <p> ( Luke 8:1-4 ) <p> The circuit was an extensive one-- " went about through cities and villages ( literally , " according to city and village " ) , preaching . " During this journey Jesus was attended by the Twelve , and by devoted women ( Mary Magdalene , Joanna , wife of Herod 's steward , Susanna , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lu 8:2,3 ) . At the close of this circuit Jesus returned to Capernaum . <p> b ) Cure of Demoniac--Discourse on Blasphemy : <p> Jesus , no doubt , wrought numerous miracles on demoniacs ( compare Lu 8:1,2 ; out of Mary Magdalene He is said to have cast 7 demons--perhaps a form of speech to indicate the severity of the possession ) . The demoniac now brought to Jesus was blind and dumb . Jesus cured him , with the double result that the people were filled with amazement : " Can this be the son of David ? " ( Mt 12:23 ) , while the Pharisees blasphemed , alleging that Jesus cast out demons by the help of Beelzebub ( Greek , Beelzeboul ) , the prince of the demons ( see under the word ) . A quite similar incident is narrated in Mt 9:32-34 ; and Lu gives the discourse that follows in a later connection ( 11:14 ff ) . The accusation may well have been repeated more than once . Jesus , in reply , points out , first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own kingdom ( Mt 18:25 parallel ; here was plainly a stronger than Satan ) ; then utters the momentous word about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit . All other blasphemies--even that against the Son of Man ( Mt 12:32 ) --may be forgiven , for they may proceed from ignorance and misconception ; but deliberate , perverse rejection of the light , and attributing to Satan what was manifestly of God , was a sin which , when matured--and the Pharisees came perilously near committing it--admitted of no forgiveness , either in this world or the next , for the very capacity for truth in the soul was by such sin destroyed . Mr has the strong phrase , " is guilty of an eternal sin " ( 3:29 ) . Pertinent words follow as to the root of good and evil in character ( Mt 12:33-37 ) . <p> Out of this discourse arose the usual Jewish demand for a " sign " ( Mt 12:38 ; compare Lu 11:29-32 ) , which Jesus met by declaring that no sign would be given but the sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reiterates His warning to the people of His generation for their rejection of greater light than had been enjoyed by the Ninevites and the Queen of Sheba . <p> Two incidents , not dissimilar in character , interrupted this discourse--one the cry of a woman in the audience ( if the time be the same , Lu 11:27,28 ) , " Blessed is the womb that bare thee , " etc. , to which Jesus replied , " Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it " ; the other , a message that His mother and brethren ( doubtless anxious for His safety ) desired to speak with Him . <p> c ) Christ 's Mother and Brethen : <p> To this , stretching out His hand toward His disciples , Jesus answered , " Behold , my mother and my brethren " ( Mr 3:34 ) , etc . Kinship in the spiritual kingdom consists in fidelity to the will of God , not in ties of earthly relationship . <h> Teaching in Parables <p> ( Matthew 13:1-52 ; Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingdom . <p> In series the parables at once mirror the origin , mixed character and development of the kingdom in its present imperfect earthly condition , and the perfection which awaits it after the crisis at the end . In the parable of the Sower is represented the origin of the kingdom in the good seed of the word , and the varied soils on which that seed falls ; in the Seed Growing Secretly , the law of orderly growth in the kingdom ; in the parable of the Tares , the mixed character of the subjects of the kingdom ; in those of the Mustard Seed and Leaven , the progress of the kingdom--external growth , internal tramsformative effect ; in those of the Treasure and Pearl the finding and worth of the kingdom ; in that of the Dragnet the consummation of the kingdom . Jesus compares His disciples , if they understand these things , to householders bringing out of their treasure " things new and old " ( Mt 13:52 ) . <h> From the Crossing to Gadara to the Mission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm <p> ( Matthew 8:18-27 ; Mark 4:35-41 ; Luke 8:22-25 ; compare 9:57-62 ) <p> It was on the evening of the day on which He spoke the parables--though the chronology of the incident seems unknown to Lu ( 8:22 ) --that Jesus bade His disciples cross over to the other side of the lake . At this juncture He was accosted by an aspirant for discipleship . Matthew gives two cases of aspirants ; Luke ( but in a different connection , 9:57-62 ) , three . Luke 's connection ( departure from Galilee ) is perhaps preferable for the second and third ; but the three may be considered together . <p> The three aspirants may be distinguished as , <p> ( a ) The forward disciple : he who in an atmosphere of enthusiasm offered himself under impulse , without counting the cost . The zeal of this would-be follower Jesus cheeks with the pathetic words , " The foxes have holes , " etc . ( Mt 8:20 ; Lu 9:58 ) . <p> ( b ) The procrastinating disciple . The first candidate needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspirants for Disciplineship : <p> He would follow Jesus , but first let him bury his father . There had come a crisis , however , when the Lord 's claim was paramount : " Leave the dead to bury their own dead " ( Mt 8:22 ) . There are at times higher claims than mere natural relationships , to which , in themselves , Jesus was the last to be indifferent . ( c ) The wavering disciple . The third disciple is again one who offers himself , but his heart was too evidently still with the things at home . Jesus , again , lays His finger on the weak spot , " No man , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , " etc . ( Lu 9:62 ) . As mentioned , the latter two cases tally better with a final departure from Galilee than with a temporary crossing of the lake . <p> b ) The Storm Calmed : <p> The inland lake was exposed to violent and sudden tempests . One of these broke on the disciples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed in jeopardy . Jesus , meanwhile , in calmest repose , was asleep on a cushion in the stern ( Mr 4:38 ) . The disciples woke Him almost rudely : " Teacher , carest thou not that we perish ? " Jesus at once arose , and , reproving their want of faith , rebuked wind and waves ( " Peace , be still " ) . Immediately there was a great calm . It was a new revelation to the disciples of the majesty of their Master . " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? " <h> The Gadarene ( Gerasene ) Demoniac <p> ( Matthew 8:28-34 ; Mark 5:1-20 ; Luke 8:26-39 ) <p> The lake being crossed , Jesus and His disciples came into the country of the Gadarenes ( Matthew ) , or Gerasenes ( Mark , Luke ) --Gadara being the capital of the district ( on the topography , compare Stanley , Sinai and Palestine , 380-81 ) . From the lake shore rises a mountain in which are ancient tombs . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoniacs : M. Henry 's quaint comment is , " If there were two , there was one . " Possibly one was the fiercer of the two , the other figuring only as his companion ) . The man , as described , was a raving maniac of the worst type ( Mr 5:3-5 ) , dwelling in the tombs , wearing no clothes ( Lu 8:27 ) , of supernatural strength , wounding himself , shrieking , etc . Really possessed by " an unclean spirit , " his consciousness was as if he were indwelt by a " legion " of demons , and from that consciousness he addressed Jesus as the Son of God come for their tormenting . In what follows it is difficult to distinguish what belongs to the broken , incoherent consciousness of the man , and the spirit or spirits who spake through him . In the question , " What is thy name ? " ( Mr 5:9 ) Jesus evidently seeks to arouse the victim 's shattered soul to some sense of its own individuality . On Jesus commanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that the demons might be permitted to enter a herd of swine feeding near . The reason of Christ 's permission , with its result in the destruction of the herd ( " rushed down the steep into the sea " ) need not be too closely scrutinized . It may have had an aspect of judgment on the ( possibly ) Jewish holders of the swine ; or it may have had reference to the victim of the possession , as enabling him to realize his deliverance . Whatever the difficulties of the narrative , none of the rationalistic explanations afford any sensible relief from them . The object of the miracle may be to exclude rationalistic explanations , by giving a manifest attestation of the reality of the demon influence . When the people of the city came they found the man fully restored-- " clothed and in his right mind . " Yet , with fatal shortsightedness , they besought Jesus to depart from their borders . The man was sent home to declare to his friends the great things the Lord had done to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( Matthew 9:18-26 ; Mark 5:21-43 ; Luke 8:40-56 ) <p> Repelled by the Gerasenes , Jesus received a warm welcome on His return to Capernaum on the western shore ( Mr 5:21 ) . It was probably at this point that Matthew gave the feast formerly referred to . <p> It was in connection with this feast , Matthew himself informs us ( 9:18 ) , that Jairus , one of the rulers of the synagogue , made his appeal for help . His little daughter , about 12 years old ( Lu 8:42 ) , was at the point of death ; indeed , while Jesus was coming , she died . The ruler 's faith , though real , was not equal to the centurion 's , who believed that Jesus could heal without being present . <p> a ) Jairus ' Appeal and Its Result : <p> Jesus came , and having expelled the professional mourners , in sacred privacy , only the father and mother , with Peter , James and John being permitted to enter the death-chamber , raised the girl to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising from the dead . <p> b ) The Afflicted Woman Cured : <p> On the way to the ruler 's house occurred another wonder--a miracle within a miracle . A poor woman , whose case was a specially distressing one , alike as regards the nature of her malady , the length of its continuance , and the fruitlessness of her application to the physicians , crept up to Jesus , confident that if she could but touch the border of His garment , she would be healed . The woman was ignorant ; her faith was blended with superstition ; but Jesus , reading the heart , gave her the benefit she desired . It was His will , however , that , for her own good , the woman thus cured should not obtain the blessing by stealth . He therefore brought her to open confession , and cheered her by His commendatory word . <h> Incidents of Third Circuit <p> ( Matthew 9:27-38 ; 13:53-58 ; Mark 6:1-6 ) <p> At this point begins apparently a new evangelistic tour ( Mt 9:35 ; Mr 6:6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To it belong in the narratives the healing of two blind men ( compare the case of Bartimeus , recorded later ) ; the cure of a demoniac who was dumb--a similar case to that in Mt 12:22 ; and a second rejection at Nazareth ( Matthew , Mark ) . The incident is similar to that in Lu 4:16-30 , and shows , if the events are different , that the people 's hearts were unchanged . Of this circuit Matthew gives an affecting summary ( 9:35-38 ) , emphasizing the Lord 's compassion , and His yearning for more laborers to reap the abundant harvest . <h> The Twelve Sent Forth--Discourse of Jesus <p> Partly with a view to the needs of the rapidly growing work and the training of the apostles , and partly as a witness to Israel ( Mt 10:6,23 ) , Jesus deemed it expedient to send the Twelve on an independent mission . The discourse in Mt attached to this event seems , as frequently , to be a compilation . Parts of it are given by Luke in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions were doubtless similar in both cases ) ; parts on other occasions ( Lu 12:2-12 ; 21:12-17 , etc. ; compare Mr 13:9-13 ) . <p> The Twelve were sent out two by two . Their work was to be a copy of the Master's--to preach the gospel and to heal the sick . To this end they were endowed with authority over unclean spirits , and over all manner of sickness . They were to go forth free from all encumbrances--no money , no scrip , no changes of raiment , no staff ( save that in their hand , Mr 6:8 ) , sandals only on their feet , etc . <p> a ) The Commission : <p> They were to rely for support on those to whom they preached . They were for the present to confine their ministry to Israel . The saying in Mt 10:23 , " Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come , " apparently has reference to the judgment on the nation , not to the final coming ( compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The mission of the Twelve was the first step of Christianity as an aggressive force in society . Jesus speaks of it , accordingly , in the light of the whole future that was to come out of it . He warns His apostles faithfully of the dangers that awaited them ; exhorts them to prudence and circumspection ( " wise as serpents , " etc. ) ; holds out to them Divine promises for consolation ; directs them when persecuted in one place to flee to another ; points out to them from His own case that such persecutions were only to be expected . He assures them of a coming day of revelation ; bids them at once fear and trust God ; impresses on them the duty of courage in confession ; inculcates in them supreme love to Himself . That love would be tested in the dearest relations , In itself peace , the gospel would be the innocent occasion of strife , enmity and division among men . Those who receive Christ 's disciples will not fail of their reward . <p> When Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , leaving the disciples to inaugurate theirs ( Mt 11:1 ) . <p> Second Period--After the Mission of the Twelve till the Departure from Galilee <h> From the Death of the Baptist till the Discourse on Bread of Life <h> The Murder of the Baptist and Herod 's Alarms <p> ( Matthew 14:1-12 ; Mark 6:14-29 ; Luke 9:7-9 ; compare 3:18-20 ) <p> Shortly before the events now to be narrated , John the Baptist had been foully murdered in his prison by Herod Antipas at the instigation of Herodias , whose unlawful marriage with Herod John had unsparingly condemned . Josephus gives as the place of the Baptist 's imprisonment the fortress of Macherus , near the Dead Sea ( Ant. , XVIII , v , 2 ) ; or John may have been removed to Galilee . Herod would ere this have killed John , but was restrained by fear of the people ( Mt 14:5 ) . The hate of Herodias , however , did not slumber . Her relentless will contrasts with the vacillation of Herod , as Lady Macbeth in Shakspeare contrasts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought for . Her daughter Saleme , pleasing Herod by her dancing , obtained from him a promise on oath to give her whatever she asked . Prompted by Herodias , she boldly demanded John the Baptist 's head . The weak king was shocked , but , for his oath 's sake , granted her what she craved . The story tells how the Baptist 's disciples reverently buried the remains of their master , and went and told Jesus . Herod 's conscience did not let him rest . When rumors reached him of a wonderful teacher and miracle-worker in Galilee , he leaped at once to the conclusion that it was John risen from the dead . Herod can not have heard much of Jesus before . An evil conscience makes men cowards . <p> Another Passover drew near ( Joh 6:4 ) , but Jesus did not on this occasion go up to the feast . <p> Returning from their mission , the apostles reported to Jesus what they had said and done ( Lu 9:10 ) ; Jesus had also heard of the Baptist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed to His disciples a retirement to a desert place across the lake , near Bethsaida ( on the topography , compare Stanley , op. cit. , 375 , 381 ) . <h> The Feeding of the Five Thousand <p> ( Matthew 14:13-21 ; Mark 6:30-44 ; Luke 9:10-17 ; John 6:1-14 ) <p> As it proved , however , the multitudes had observed their departure , and , running round the shore , were at the place before them ( Mr 6:33 ) . The purpose of rest was frustrated , but Jesus did not complain . He pitied the shepherdless state of the people , and went out to teach and heal them . The day wore on , and the disciples suggested that the fasting multitude should disperse , and seek victuals in the nearest towns and villages . This Jesus , who had already proved Philip by asking how the people should be fed ( Joh 6:5 ) , would not permit . With the scanty provision at command--5 loaves and 2 fishes--He fed the whole multitude . By His blessing the food was multiplied till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully collected , remained over . It was astupendous act of creative power , no rationalizing of which can reduce it to natural dimensions . <h> Walking on the Sea <p> ( Matthew 14:22-33 ; Mark 6:45-52 ; John 6:15-21 ) <p> The enthusiasm created by this miracle was intense ( Joh 6:14 ) . Matthew and Mark relate ( Luke here falls for a time out of the Synopsis ) that Jesus hurriedly constrained His disciples to enter into their boat and recross the lake--this though a storm was gathering--while He Himself remained in the mountain alone in prayer . John gives the key to this action in the statement that the people were about to take Him by force and make Him a king ( 6:15 ) . Three hours after midnight found the disciples still in the midst of the lake , " distressed in rowing " ( Mr 6:48 ) , deeply anxious because Jesus was not , as on a former occasion , with them . At last , at the darkest hour of their extremity , Jesus was seen approaching in a way unlooked-for--walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise to the disciples . They were at first terrified , thinking they saw a spirit , but straightway the well-known voice was heard , " Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid . " In the rebound of his feelings the impulsive Peter asked Jesus to permit him to come to Him on the water ( Matthew ) . Jesus said " Come , " and for the first moment or two Peter did walk on the water ; then , as he realized his unwonted situation , his faith failed , and he began to sink . Jesus , with gentle chiding , caught him , and assisted him back into the boat . Once again the sea was calmed , and the disciples watch found themselves safely at land . To their adoring minds the miracle of the loaves was eclipsed by this new marvel ( Mr 6:52 ) . <h> Gennesaret--Discourse on the Bread of Life <p> ( Matthew 14:34-36 ; Mark 6:53-56 ; John 6:22-71 ) <p> On the return to Gennesaret the sick from all quarters were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry of healing ( Mr 6:56 ) . Meanwhile--here we depend on John--the people on the other side of the lake , when they found that Jesus was gone , took boats hastily , and came over to Capernaum . They found Jesus apparently in the synagogue ( 6:59 ) . In reply to their query , " Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? " Jesus first rebuked the motive which led them to follow Him--not because they had seen in His miracles " signs " of higher blessings , but because they had eaten of the loaves and were filled ( 6:26 ) --then spoke to them His great discourse on the bread from heaven . " Work , " He said , " for the food which abideth unto eternal life , which the Son of man shall give unto you " ( 6:27 ) . When asked to authenticate His claims by a sign from heaven like the manna , He replied that the manna also ( given not by Moses but by God ) was but typical bread , and surprised them by declaring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6:35,51 ) . The bread was Christ 's flesh , given for the life of the world ; His flesh and blood must be eaten and drunk ( a spiritual appropriation through faith , 6:63 ) , if men were to have eternal life . Jesus of set purpose had put His doctrine in a strong , testing manner . The time had come when His hearers must make their choice between a spiritual acceptance of Him and a break with Him altogether . What He had said strongly offended them , both on account of the claims implied ( 6:42 ) , and on account of the doctrine taught , which , they were plainly told , they could not receive because of their carnality of heart ( 6:43,44,61-64 ) . Many , therefore , went back and walked no more with Him ( 6:60,61,66 ) ; but their defection only evoked from the chosen Twelve a yet more confident confession of their faith . " Would ye also go away ? " <p> Peter 's First Confession . <p> Peter , as usual , spoke for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? .... We have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God " ( Joh 6:69 ) . Here , and not first at Caesarea Philippi ( Mt 16:16 ) , is Peter 's brave confession of his Master 's Messiahship . Twelve thus confessed Him , but even of this select circle Jesus was compelled to say , " One of you ( Judas ) is a devil " ( Joh 6:70,71 ) . <h> From Disputes with the Pharisees till the Transfiguration <p> The discourse in Capernaum seems to mark a turning-point in the Lord 's ministry in Galilee . Soon after we find Him ceasing from public teaching , and devoting Himself to the instruction of His apostles ( Mt 15:21 ; Mr 7:24 , etc . ) . <h> Jesus and Tradition--Outward and Inward Purity <p> ( Matthew 15:1-20 ; Mark 7:1-23 ) <p> Meanwhile , that Christ 's work in Galilee was attracting the attention of the central authorities , is shown by the fact that scribes and Pharisees came up from Jerusalem to watch Him . They speedily found ground of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregard of the traditions of the elders . They specially blamed Him for allowing His disciples to eat bread with " common , " i.e. unwashen hands . Here was a point on which the Pharisees laid great stress ( Mr 7:3,4 ) . Ceremonial ablutions ( washing " diligently , " Greek " with the fist " ; " baptizings " of person and things ) formed a large part of their religion . These washings were part of the " oral tradition " said to have been delivered to Moses , and transmitted by a succession of elders . Jesus set all this ceremonialism aside . It was part of the " hypocrisy " of the Pharisees ( Mr 7:6 ) . When questioned regarding it , He drew a sharp distinction between God 's commandment in the Scriptures and man 's tradition , and accused the Pharisees ( instancing " Corban " ( which see ) , in support , Mr 7:10-12 ) of making " void " the former through the latter . This led to the wider question of wherein real defilement consisted . Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anything outward , as in meats , but consisted in what came from within the man : as Jesus explained afterward , in the outcome of his heart or moral life : " Out of the heart of men evil thoughts proceed , " etc . ( Mr 7:20-23 ) . Christ 's saying was in effect the abrogation of the old ceremonial distinctions , as Mark notes : " making all meats clean " ( Mr 7:19 ) . The Pharisees , naturally , were deeply offended at His sayings , but Jesus was unmoved . Every plant not of the Father 's planting must be rooted up ( Mr 7:13 ) . <h> Retirement to Tyre and Sidon--the Syrophoenician Woman <p> ( Matthew 15:21-28 ; Mark 7:24-30 ) <p> From this point Jesus appears , in order to escape notice , to have made journeys privately from place to place . His first retreat was to the borders , or neighborhood , of Tyre and Sidon . From Mr 7:31 it is to be inferred that He entered the heathen territory . He could not , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long ere , in the house into which He had entered , there reached Him the cry of human distress . A woman came to Him , a Greek ( or Gentile , Greek-speaking ) , but Syrophoenician by race . Her " little daughter " was grievously afflicted with an evil spirit . Flinging herself at His feet , and addressing Him as " Son of David , " she besought His mercy for her child . At first Jesus seemed--yet only seemed--to repel her , speaking of Himself as sent only to the lost sheep of Israel , and of the unmeetness of giving the children 's loaf to the dogs ( the Greek softens the expression , " the little dogs " ) . With a beautiful urgency which won for her the boon she sought , the woman seized on the word as an argument in her favor . " Even the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs . " The child at Jesus ' word was restored . <h> At Decapolis--New Miracles <p> ( Matthew 15:29-39 ; Mark 7:31-37 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district of the ten cities--East of the Jordan . Here also He was soon discovered , and followed by the multitude . Sufferers were brought to Him , whom He cured ( Mt 15:30 ) . Later , He fed the crowds . <p> The miracle of the deaf man is attested only by Mk . The patient was doubly afflicted , being deaf , and having an impediment in his speech . The cure presents several peculiarities--its privacy ( Mt 15:33 ) ; the actions of Jesus in putting his fingers into his ears , etc. ( a mode of speech by signs to the deaf man ) ; His " sign , " accompanied with prayer , doubtless accasioned by something in the man 's look ; the word Ephphatha ( Mt 15:34 ) -- " Be opened . " <p> a ) The Deaf Man : <p> ( Mark 7:32-37 ) <p> The charge to those present not to blazon the deed abroad was disregarded . Jesus desired no cheap popularity . <p> b ) Feeding of Four Thousand : <p> ( Matthew 15:32-39 ; Mark 8:1-9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Five Thousand at Bethsaida , but the place and numbers are different ; 4,000 instead of 5,000 ; 7 loaves and a few fishes , instead of 5 loaves and 2 fishes ; 7 baskets of fragments instead of 12 ( Mark 's term denotes a larger basket ) . There is no reason for doubting the distinction of the incidents ( compare Mt 16:9,10 ; Mr 8:19,20 ) . <h> Leaven of the Pharisees , etc. --Cure of Blind Man <p> ( Matthew 16:1-12 ; Mark 8:11-26 ) <p> Returning to the plain of Gennesaret ( Magdala , Mt 15:39 the King James Version ; parts of Dalmanutha , Mr 8:10 ) , Jesus soon found Himself assailed by His old adversaries . Pharisees and Sadducees were now united . They came " trying " Jesus , and asking from Him a " sign from heaven " --some signal Divine manifestation . " Sighing deeply " ( Mark ) at their caviling spirit , Jesus repeated His word about the sign of Jonah . The times in which they lived were full of signs , if they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be rid of such questioners , Jesus anew took boat to Bethsaida . On the way He warned His disciples against the leaven of the spirit they had just encountered . The disciples misunderstood , thinking that Jesus referred to their forgetfulness in not taking bread ( Mark states in his graphic way that they had only one loaf ) . The leaven Christ referred to , in fact , represented three spirits : <p> Arrived at Bethsaida , a miracle was wrought on a blind man resembling in some of its features the cure of the deaf man at Decapolis . In both cases Jesus took the patients apart ; in both physical means were used--the spittle ( " spit on his eyes , " Mr 8:23 ) ; in both there was strict injunction not to noise the cure abroad . Another peculiarity was the gradualness of the cure . It is probable that the man had not been blind from his birth , else he could hardly have recognized men or trees at the first opening . It needed that Jesus should lay His hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next retirement of Jesus with His disciples was to the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi , near the source of the Jordan . This was the northernmost point of His journeyings . Here , " on the geographical frontier between Judaism and heathenism " ( Liddon ) , our Lord put the momentous question which called forth Peter 's historical confession . <p> ( 1 ) The Voices of the Age and the External Truth . <p> The question put to the Twelve in this remote region was : " Who do men say that the Son of man is ? " " Son of man , " as already said , was the familiar name given by Jesus to Himself , to which a Messianic significance might or might not be attached , according to the prepossessions of His hearers . First the changeful voices of the age were recited to Jesus : " Some say John the Baptist ; some , Elijah , " etc . Next , in answer to the further question : " But who say ye that I am ? " there rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanging truth about Jesus : " Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . " In clearness , boldness , decision , Peter 's faith had attained a height not reached before . The confession embodies two truths : <p> ( 1 ) the Divinity , <p> ( 2 ) the Messiahship , of the Son of man . <p> Jesus did honor to the confession of His apostle . Not flesh and blood , but the Father , had revealed the truth to him . Here at length was " rock " on which He could build a church . Reverting to Peter 's original name , Simon Bar-Jonah , Jesus declared , with a play on the name " Peter " ( petros , " rock , " " piece of rock " ) He had before given him ( Joh 1:42 ) , that on this " rock " ( petra ) , He would build His church , and the gates of Hades ( hostile evil powers ) would not prevail against it ( Mt 16:18 ) . The papacy has reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " rock " to be Peter personally and his successors in the see of Rome ( none such existed ; Peter was not bishop of Rome ) . It is not Peter the individual , but Peter the confessing apostle--Peter as representative of all--that Christ names " rock " ; that which constituted him a foundation was the truth he had confessed ( compare Eph 2:20 ) . This is the first New Testament mention of a " church " ( ekklesia ) . The Christian church , therefore , is founded <p> ( 1 ) on the truth of Christ 's Divine Sonship ; <p> ( 2 ) on the truth of His Messiah-ship , or of His being the anointed prophet , priest and king of the new age . <p> A society of believers confessing these truths is a church ; no society which denies these truths deserves the name . To this confessing community Jesus , still addressing Peter as representing the apostolate ( compare Mt 18:18 ) , gives authority to bind and loose--to admit and to exclude . Jesus , it is noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mt 16:20 ; Mr 8:30 ; Lu 9:21 ) . <p> ( 2 ) The Cross and the Disciple . <h> The Transfiguration--the Epileptic Boy <p> ( Matthew 17:1-20 ; Mark 9:2-29 ; Luke 9:28-43 ) <p> About eight days after the announcement of His passion by Jesus , took place the glorious event of the transfiguration . Jesus had spoken of His future glory , and here was pledge of it . In strange contrast with the scene of glory on the summit of the mountain was the painful sight which met Jesus and His three companions when they descended again to to the plain . <p> Tradition connects the scene of the transfiguration with Mount Tabor , but it more probably took place on one of the spurs of Mount Hermon . Jesus had ascended the mountain with Peter , James and John , for prayer . It was while He was praying the wonderful change happened . For once the veiled glory of the only begotten from the Father ( Joh 1:14 ) was permitted to burst forth , suffusing His person and garments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine as the sun ; His raiment became white as light ( " as snow , " the King James Version , Mark ) . Heavenly visitants , recognized from their converse as Moses and Elijah , appeared with Him and spoke of His decease ( Luke ) . A voice from an enveloping cloud attested : " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . " Little wonder the disciples were afraid , or that Peter in his confusion should stammer out : " It is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , I will make here three tabernacles ( booths ) . " This , however , was not permitted . Earth is not heaven . Glimpses of heavenly glory are given , not to wean from duty on earth , but to prepare for the trials connected therewith . <p> b ) Faith 's Entreaty and Its Answer : <h> From Private Journey through Galilee till Return from the Feast of Tabernacles <h> Galilee and Capernaum <p> Soon after the last-mentioned events Jesus passed privately through Galilee ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Galilean journey Jesus made to His disciples His 2nd announcement of His approaching sufferings and death , accompanied as before by the assurance of His resurrection . The disciples still could not take in the meaning of His words , though what He said made them " exceeding sorry " ( Mt 17:23 ) . <p> a ) Second Announcement of Passion : <p> ( Matthew 17:22,23 ; Mark 9:30-33 ; Luke 9:44,45 ) <p> The return to Capernaum was marked by an incident which raised the question of Christ 's relation to temple institutions . The collectors of tribute for the temple inquired of Peter : " Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel ? " ( Greek didrachma , or double drachm , worth about 32 cents or is. 4d . ) . <p> b ) The Temple Tax : <p> ( Matthew 17:24-27 ) <p> The origin of this tax was in the half-shekel of atonement-money of Ex 30:11-16 , which , though a special contribution , was made the basis of later assessment ( 2Ch 24:4-10 ; in Nehemiah 's time the amount was one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object was the upkeep of the temple worship ( Schurer ) . The usual time of payment was March , but Jesus had probably been absent and the inquiry was not made for some months later . Peter , hasty as usual , probably reasoning from Christ 's ordinary respect for temple ordinances , answered at once that He did pay the tax . It had not occurred to him that Jesus might have something to say on it , if formally challenged . Occasion therefore was taken by Jesus gently to reprove Peter . Peter had but recently acknowledged Jesus to be the Son of God . Do kings of the earth take tribute of their own sons ? The half-shekel was suitable to the subject-relation , but not to the relation of a son . Nevertheless , lest occasion of stumbling be given , Jesus could well waive this right , as , in His humbled condition , He had waived so many more . Peter was ordered to cast his hook into the sea , and Jesus foretold that the fish he would bring up would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 64 cents or 2s. 8d . ) . The tax was paid , yet in such a way as to show that the payment of it was an act of condescension of the king 's Son . <p> c ) Discourse on Greatness and Forgiveness : <p> ( Matthew 18:1-35 ; Mark 9:33-50 ; Luke 9:46-50 ) <p> On the way to Capernaum a dispute had arisen among the disciples as to who should be greatest in the Messianic kingdom about to be set up . The fact of such disputing showed how largely even their minds were yet dominated by worldly , sensuous ideas of the kingdom . Now , in the house ( Mr 9:33 ) , Jesus takes occasion to check their spirit of ambitious rivalry , and to inculcate much-needed lessons on greatness and kindred matters . <p> ( 1 ) Greatness in Humility . <p> First , by the example of a little child , Jesus teaches that humility is the root-disposition of His kingdom . It alone admits to the kingdom , and conducts to honor in it . He is greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the servant of all ( Mr 9:35 ) . He warns against slighting the " little ones , " or causing them to stumble , and uses language of terrible severity against those guilty of this sin . <p> ( 2 ) Tolerance . <p> The mention of receiving little ones in Christ 's name led John to remark that he had seen one casting out demons in Christ 's name , and had forbidden him , because he was not of their company . " Forbid him not , " Jesus said , " for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me . For he that is not against us is for us " ( Mr 9:39,40 ) . <p> ( 3 ) The Erring Brother . <p> The subject of offenses leads to the question of sins committed by one Christian brother against another . Here Christ inculcates kindness and forbearance ; only if private representations and the good offices of brethren fail , is the matter to be brought before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unstintedly forgiven ( " seventy times seven , " Mt 18:22 ) . If the church is compelled to interpose , its decisions are valid ( under condition , however , of prayer and Christ 's presence , Mt 18:18-20 ) . <p> ( 4 ) Parable of the Unmerciful Servant . <p> To enforce the lesson of forgiveness Jesus speaks the parable of the Unmerciful Servant ( Mt 18:23-35 ) . Himself forgiven much , this servant refuses to forgive his fellow a much smaller debt . His lord visits him with severest punishment . Only as we forgive others can we look for forgiveness . <h> The Feast of Tabernacles--Discourses , etc . <p> ( John 7-10:21 ) <p> The Gospel of John leaves a blank of many months between chapters 6 and 7 , covered only by the statement , " After these things , Jesus walked in Galilee " ( 7:1 ) . In this year of His ministry Jesus had gone neither to the feast of the Passover nor to Pentecost . The Feast of Tabernacles was now at hand ( October ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a full record of His appearance , discourses and doings there . <p> a ) The Private Journey--Divided Opinions : <p> ( John 7:1-10 ) <p> The brethren of Jesus , still unpersuaded of His claims ( Joh 7:5 ) , had urged Jesus to go up with them to the feast . " Go up , " in their sense , included a public manifestation of Himself as the Messiah . Jesus replied that His time for this had not yet come . Afterward He went up quietly , and in the midst of the feast appeared in the temple as a teacher . The comments made about Jesus at the feast before His arrival vividly reflect the divided state of opinion regarding Him . " He is a good man , " thought some . " Not so , " said others , " but He leadeth the multitude astray . " His teaching evoked yet keener division . While some said , " Thou hast a demon " ( Joh 7:20 ) , others argued , " When the Christ shall come , will he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some declared , " This is of a truth the prophet , " or " This is the Christ " ; others objected that the Christ was to come out of Bethlehem , not Galilee ( Joh 7:40-42 ) . Yet no one dared to take the step of molesting Him . <p> b ) Christ 's Self-Witness : <p> ( John 7:14-52 ) <p> c ) The Woman Taken in Adultery : <p> ( John 8 ) <p> d ) The Cure of the Blind Man : <p> ( John 9 ) <p> The Feast of Tabernacles was past , but Jesus was still in Jerusalem . Passing by on a Sabbath ( Joh 9:14 ) , He saw a blind man , a beggar ( John 9:8 ) , well known to have been blind from his birth . The narrative of the cure and examination of this blind man is adduced by Paley as bearing in its inimitable circumstantiality every mark of personal knowledge on the part of the historian . The man , cured in strange but symbolic fashion by the anointing of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then washing in the Pool of Siloam , became an object of immediate interest , and every effort was made by the Pharisees to shake his testimony as to the miracle that had been wrought . The man , however , held to his story , and his parents could only corroborate the fact that their son had been born blind , and now saw . The Pharisees themselves were divided , some reasoning that Jesus could not be of God because He had broken the Sabbath--the old charge ; others , Nicodemus-like , standing on the fact that a man who was a sinner could not do such signs ( Joh 9:15,16 ) . The healed man applied the logic of common-sense : " If this man were not from God , he could do nothing " ( Joh 9:33 ) . The Pharisees , impotent to deny the wonder , could only cast him out of the synagogue . Jesus found him , and brought him to full confession of faith in Himself ( Joh 9:35-38 ) . <p> e ) The Good Shepherd : <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record arising out of this incident . In continuation of His reply to the question of the Pharisees in John ( 9:40 ) , " Are we also blind ? " Jesus spoke to them His discourse on the Good Shepherd . Flocks in eastern countries are gathered at night into an enclosure surrounded by a wall or palisade . This is the " fold , " which is under the care of a " porter , " who opens the closely barred door to the shepherds in the morning . As contrasted with the legitimate shepherds , the false shepherds " enter not by the door , " but climb over some other way . The allusion is to priests , scribes , Pharisees and generally to all , in any age , who claim an authority within the church unsanctioned by God ( Godet ) . Jesus now gathers up the truth in its relation to Himself as the Supreme Shepherd . From His fundamental relation to the church , He is not only the Shepherd , but the Door ( 10:7-14 ) . To those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision ( 10:9 ) . In his capacity as Shepherd Christ is preeminently all that a faithful shepherd ought to be . The highest proof of His love is that , as the Good Shepherd , He lays down His life for the sheep ( 10:11,15,17 ) . This laying down of His life is not an accident , but is His free , voluntary act ( 10:17,18 ) . Again there was division among the Jews because of these remarkable sayings ( 10:19-21 ) . <p> Chronological Note . <p> Though John does not mention the fact , there is little doubt that , after this visit to Jerusalem , Jesus returned to Galilee , and at no long interval from His return , took His final departure southward . The chronology of this closing period in Galilee is somewhat uncertain . Some would place the visit to the Feast of Tabernacles before the withdrawal to Caesarea Philippi , or even earlier ( compare Andrews , Life of our Lord , etc. ) ; but the order adopted above appears preferable .

@@35723415 @4723415/ <h> Introduction and Human Origins <p> A Handout on the Work of God was given in class . Dr Ware will not lecture on this topic . <p> A. The Decree <p> B. Creation <p> C. Providence <p> Angels <p> We do not have a recording of this lecture , but Dr. Ware gave us a detailed discussion of the lectures as a Word document . You will have to unzip it before Word can read it . It can be found at LONG ... under the heading Angels . <h> Doctrine of Humanity Part 1 <h> I. Introduction : Why Study Christian Anthropology ? <p> This is a very good question to ask of any of these areas we study ; what are the reasons for it ? <h> A. Who We Are <p> This answers one of the most critical questions as human beings : who are we ? What is it to be a human being ? Are we the byproduct of chance , of genetic mutations that have come into existence , into this complex reality called human existence ? Are we here by design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God ? What is the reason for our existence ? Who are we ? Why are we here ? It is one the most fundamental questions we can ask as human beings . What is our purpose ? If you do n't have a handle on this question , think about living life , coming to the end of life and not knowing what it is about . Think about whether or not you have been living in a way that would advance the purpose of your being here or not . What a tragedy when you think about failing to live in accord with our created purpose , if in fact there is one . So it is a very important thing to think about . <h> B. Our Place in relation God <p> It helps us to understand our place in relation to God . You might remember that Calvin begins his ' ' Institutes ' ' by saying there are two things that theology concerns itself with . One is who God is and the second is who we are as human beings . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is to understand who we are as made in the image of God . It is not only that we are images of God that makes it important to understand who God is and then who we are , but rather that we are in fact his creatures . So we recognize in our existence as human beings that we belong to him ; we are created by him ; we are owned by him ; we are dependent upon him ; we owe everything to him . To think of ourselves and to study anthropology divorced from God is idolatry . It is to think that we , in ourselves , can understand who we are , make sense of our lives , and make life meaningful apart from God . That is idolatry . This is exactly what Paul said in Romans 1 . <p> Rom 1:21a For even though they knew God , they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him . <p> Instead they focused on the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed forever . So when we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand better who we are in relationship to God . We do n't leave God in the dust as we move on to us . We , rather , are very much aware that our understanding of who we are has everything to do with who God is and our relationship to him , our dependence upon him and his purposes for us . <h> C. Our place in relation other humans <p> One of the great lessons of Genesis 2 is that isolated man is not the ideal . It is amazing that when you read in Genesis 1 God said it was good . <p> , the sixth day . <p> Then you come to chapter 2 about Adam ; he has cultivated the garden , and he is naming the animals and God says , " It is not good . " This is the first time you hear " not good " and there is no sin yet . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no sin . And God says , " It is not good that man should be alone " ( Gen 2:18 ) . So he makes a helper suitable for him and brings her to him , and he names her ' ' ishshah ' ' ( woman ) because she was taken from ' ' ish ' ' ( man ) . You get this sense that the purpose of God at the very beginning is to indicate that ideal human existence is social , not individual autonomous man unrelated to other persons but rather social existence . <p> You see this in the community of faith . There is the whole body principle that Ray Steadman talked about so much in the 1970 's , and the spiritual gifting movement that has come up . We in the West , with our emphasis on individuality and individual achievement and the like , have really missed a central component of biblical teaching ; and that is the notion of community and corporate solidarity , the sense that we need one another as body members contributing to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to understand that ideal human existence is not isolated human existence but social human existence . That lesson comes right from the very beginning of the Bible . Even Jesus was in community . Did you think it was just phony in the Garden of Gethsemane when he called Peter , James and John to come pray with him ? He says , pray with me ; the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . Here you certainly have the " Lone Ranger ; " here you have " Superman " who does n't need anyone else . Did Jesus actually crave and have a felt need for the community of his friends , for these disciples who would join him in praying fervently for this hour of testing and they failed ? Was it a genuine longing on his part ? Absolutely . In fact this is one of the questions I have to ask the Lord in glory one day . I want to ask Jesus this question , " Was your agony in the Garden of Gethsemane , when you prayed and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your agony made worse because the disciples whom you asked to pray with you fell asleep and failed to do what you asked them to do ? Do n't you think that is a good question ? I think I know the answer , but I want to hear it from him . <h> D. Our place in relation creation <p> There is a lot about who we are in relation to creation that is very important in this doctrine . We are stewards of this world God has made . We were created by God to rule over the fish of the sea , the birds of the air , and the creeping , crawling things on the face of the earth . This means that we have dominion , yes , but that does n't translate into a kind of exploitation . Having dominion means that we have a responsibility to care ; we are caretakers of the world God has made . There ought to be a much more vibrant Christian environmentalism that is n't the kind of radical environmentalism that is so prominent today making monkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo many years ago in Minneapolis , the Minneapolis Zoo , and turning a corner there was big sign that said , " You are about to see the one species that has caused the most problems on the face of the earth , and if this species were n't here the world would be a wonderful place . " That is a paraphrase . When you rounded the corner a mirror was there . This is the kind of radical environmentalism that makes chimpanzees and eagle eggs much more important than fetuses and human beings . This is absolutely abominable . <p> In Genesis 9 after the flood , God told Noah , you can kill animals and eat them , but you ca n't kill human beings because they are made in my image . We have to acknowledge the supremacy of the human race in the world by God 's design , but the responsibility that the human race has in the world as caretaker to treat with respect and care and responsibility what God has made . That comes right from the very beginning in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we are in all of these relationships , with God , with one another , and with the environment , this doctrine is huge and important . It answers some of the most fundamental questions that we have as human beings , and it is critical . <h> II . Humanity 's Origin <h> A. God the Creator <h> 1 . Creator of all that is <p> Truly it is true , as you look at Scripture , that God has created everything that is . Would n't it do , then , in talking about humanity 's origin , simply to say we are part of the creation of God ? God created all that is , so that is all we need to say . No , we need to say that we are in a very special way the creation of God . God made all ; that is absolutely clear . Genesis 1 outlines everything that happened at the end of it ; God says that everything he had made was very good . So we know that everything that God made was good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need to say that in creation it is also clear that God wants us to see that the place of humanity is special . It is not just like anything else out there . There is a special place for the formation of humanity in particular . This is even clear in Genesis one and two . As you read through those chapters it is hard to miss the fact that the author is intending us to see the special place of humanity in creation . What indicators are there in Genesis one and two that we are meant to see the formation of humanity as special ? What are some of the things that are evident to us in those two chapters ? It is man who is to name the animals . So obviously there is a sense in which man is over the animals . So we are not just like the others ; we name them . What does naming indicate ? There is an authority that is invested in you , Adam , by which you are able to name the animals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that . This is really a remarkable . Who made those animals ? Did Adam make them ? No , God brought to Adam the animals he had made . So who has the rights to name them ? God does , but he say says , Adam , you name them . Whatever name you give them that will be its name . I can imagine God up there going , " Hippopotamus ? Are you sure about that ? " Well ok . Whatever Adam named it that is its name . That is what the text says . So Adam has prerogative of rulership . <p> What other indicators are there that humanity has a special place in creation ? We are created in the image of God . In Genesis 1:26-27 there is such a stress on this that whatever it means , it obviously means that we are different ; we are special . There is something about the formation of humanity that is highlighted by this . <p> Gen 1:26 Then God said , " Let us make man in our he created them . <p> That humanity is made in the image of God is a clear indicator that there is something special . <p> What else ? There is so much more detail on the creation of man compared to the rest of creation . The way I like to put it is this ; you have six days in Genesis 1 of creation ; of those six days , the last half of the sixth day is the creation of man . Only one of those days is given a sort of a movie presentation . You have these pictures , snapshots throughout Genesis 1 of all these different elements of creation and then you have a movie . And the movie is of what ? The man and then the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special emphasis on the formation of man , of male and female as his image . <p> Another indicator of his rulership is he plants the garden and puts man in it and says , you tend the garden . It is my garden my earth , my world ; I made it , you tend it . <p> With humanity , there is a relationship with God that in not true of the other aspects of creation . God comes to man and he gives a moral command . <p> Gen 2:16 The Lord God commanded the man , saying , " From any tree of the garden you may you eat from it you will surely die . " <p> Here is a special kind of relationship because includes that moral relationship . There is that moral bond between God and the man at that point . He has a moral obligation before God . There is no hint of that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . If your dog jumps the fence and goes out and bites somebody and they die , you may shoot the dog , but what you wo n't do is take that dog to a court of law and hold it accountable for moral wrong doing . But if a human being does that , you will take them to court . We are moral agents before God . That is clear in the command , in the moral relationship with God . <p> What else ? He blesses them and in a special sense wants them to be productive , reproduce , to fill the earth and rule over that earth . <p> What else ? The tree of Life was something only the man could have . You can eat of all these trees , including the Tree of Life is presumed in that . <p> What else ? The promise of redemption for the man that comes in chapter 3 . <p> Let me point out to you a couple of other things . One is in Geneses 1:26 . The language changes in how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of creating are introduced with the phrase " then God said let there be ... " Notice the difference in verse 26 . <p> You get this sense of deliberation . I take this as a preliminary indicator of the Triune God . Jewish commentators have a hard time explaining ( because they are unitarian , monotheists ) the plural here . Some have insisted that it must be God deliberating with the angels . The problem is that we are not made in the image of the angels . This ca n't be God saying let us , the angels and me , create man in our image . This is not going to work . This is likely the Trinity , the deliberation of the Trinity . He says , " Let us make man , " so there is deliberation ; there is intentionality and purpose that is stated as the reason for this creation , " Let us make man in our image , according to our likeness ; and let them rule over ... " <p> The other thing that I want to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of humanity . The term ' ' asah ' ' is used . The normal ordinary Hebrew word is used , ' ' asah ' ' , which means to make something . <p> Gen 1:26a Then God said , " Let us make man in our image , <p> In Genesis 1:1 the word ' ' bara ' ' is used . This is a much more significant term . <p> Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . <p> ' ' bareshith bara elohim ' ' indicates a kind of creating work only God can do . ' ' bBara ' ' is also used in Genesis he created them . <p> ' ' Bara ' ' is used three times . This threefold use of ' ' bara ' ' indicates an emphasis of creation of human beings . Only God could do this ; could make this particular creation of man , male and female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' yatsar ' ' is used . This is a term that is used for a potter shaping the clay into the kind of pot that he wants . It has this notion of both design and artistry . <p> became a living being . <p> It is like God formed man of dust from the ground like a potter would take the clay and shape it into the man that he intended . Again it has this notion of intentionality , purpose , design that is attached to it . <p> Similarly in the creation of the woman in Genesis 2:22 the term ' ' banah ' ' is used . <p> Gen 2:22 The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man , and brought her to the man . <p> It could be translated " built into a woman " or " fashioned into a woman . " It has the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in a construction project . You make this into what you have designed it to be . <p> The language alone , that is , these terms that are used indicate the special place that human beings have in creation . <h> 2 . Special Place for the Formation of Humanity in Particular <p> So we have seen that God has created all that there is . But it wo n't do to stop there and say that is sufficient for explaining us , to merely say we are creatures . That makes it look as though there is no difference between a frog and a human being . That is not true . There is clearly in the text reason for holding that God views human beings in a very special place in his creation . <h> 3 . Brief Theology of Humanity 's Creation by God <p> This is a list of some of the things that I think that flow out of this notion of the fact that we are created by God and have this special place before him . <p> a . God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the most basic level this is one of lessons that we must take away from the doctrine of creation , the creation of us as human beings . That is that God is ultimate , and we are not . He is creator ; we are creature . He is the owner ; we are owned . We are dependent upon him for absolutely everything . Paul says it in Acts 17 . <p> Acts 17:25 nor is he served by human hands , as though he needed anything , since he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things . <p> Every now and then I consciously sit at my desk or sit in the car and take a deep breath and think , " That breath was a gift of God , as is every one through the day , 99.9% of which I am not even aware of . " How many times have you breathed since you sat down in the chair you are in today ? Every breath is a gift . God hold our lives in his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dream and aspiration , every relationship , everything . We are dependent upon God for absolutely everything . <p> By virtue of God being creator , we owe to him our obedience , loyalty , and worship . This is owed to him ; this is not something from a moral stand point as optional . When God commands that we worship the LORD our God and worship him only , what he is commanding is that we do what is right and obligatory for us because he is God . He is God . He demands what he deserves : our obedience , our loyalty , our worship . This is not an optional thing . Just as for children it is not an optional thing for them to obey their parents or not . They may think it is . They may behave like it is , but it is n't . It is not an option . And even more so is this the case with creator and creature . We owe to God our absolute obedience . It is a travesty of moral justice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Most people do n't have a clue why Hell is what it is . They do n't have a clue who God is and what his demands are upon us because of his rights as creator . So we really are made to glorify God . Our inherent designed purpose is to bring glory to God through our obedience to him , our love for him , our adoration for him , our loyalty to him . When we do that , we fulfill part of that which we were created for . <p> c . Humanity , as created by God , was entirely good ( body and soul ) <p> You may have noticed that I separated the doctrines of humanity and sin . I do that intentionally , not that you and I are not sinful humans . Those two things do go together ; we are sinful humans , but we dare not think that humanity is sinful . But we do think that way . I can remember times when I hear someone who has been involved in some immoral relationship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just human . " Or somebody is involved in some other kind of scandal , and they yield to the temptation that was in front of them and we say , " Well , they were just human . " What are you saying by that ? Was n't Christ human ? He was tempted in every way yet was without sin . Who was more human in the way he lived his life , him or us ? The answer is him , Christ . He lived a more authentically human life than we do . So here is the difference : two cars are in the parking lot , both BMWs , same year , same vintage , same horsepower . This one is bright and shiny and tuned up and absolutely runs great . The other one right next to it is dented and rusted , three spark plugs are out , and the thing has n't been maintained at all . Which one is the more authentic BMW ? It is pretty clear is n't it ? Christ is the first one , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity . Humanity as created by God is good . We will be human one day in our glorified state , and we will never sin . We will be more fully human than we are now . It is just like if you took that beat up BMW and put a lot of money into it and fixed it and got it back to what it is suppose be . It is a whole more BMW than it was before . That is what God is doing . This reclamation project is to take a marred , dented demolished humanity and make it what it ought to be . <p> The other point I want to make on this is the aspect of body and soul , of human sexuality . God thought it up . He invented it . Everything that goes into human sexuality , he made it . He drew the blueprints for it . He made the genetics for it . It is an incredible thing . I have often times wondered why God made human sexuality to be just what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make human sexual expression to be this sort of experience of ecstasy which it can be ? What happens with sexual expression between a man and a woman ? What is connected to that ? Reproduction . Here you have God who creates human beings in his image . Have you ever noticed this , in Genesis 5 when Seth is born , it says , <p> Gen 5:3 When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he became the father of a son in his own likeness , according to his image , and named him Seth . <p> How is Seth in the image of God ? By being in the image of Adam who is the image of God . So what does God do ? Instead of creating a billion people at one time the way he did with angels who do n't reproduce , he makes a couple , one pair . He says that he is going to give them a piece in his role in creation . You become creators ; procreation procreates . You become creators , and just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the image of God , I am going to make this experience like nothing else in life . That is what it is about . It is meant to express the joy , the pleasure , the exuberance God has in creating us as his image . The body is good . Sex is good . <p> There is a proportionality principle that you can see on just about everything in life . The greater the potential for good , think of technology or nuclear capabilities , the greater the potential for evil goes with it . If all you 've got is a BB gun , you have that much potential for good that can be done and that much potential for evil . Up the scale you go in terms of technology . Sexuality is one of the most powerful aspects of life that God has given to human beings ; there is no doubt about it . There is great potential for good in marriage with a husband and wife who love each other for life . Jodi and have been married for 24 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple . By God 's grace I have never had sex with another woman other than my wife Jodi . She has never had sex with another man other than me , her husband . We do n't know what it would be like with another person . I do n't want to know what it would be like with another person . I love being with my wife . It is wonderful . When it is done right , it is absolutely glorious . When it is done wrong it is devastating . Look around at the devastation and how Satan works to make the devastation look nonetheless attractive . Talk to your typical prostitute and find out what her life is really like . Do n't judge this kind of thing by pictures in the magazines ; ask her , find out . It is devastating . Humanity as created by God was good . Sex is good . It is not a bad thing ; it is a wonderful gift . It is powerful gift . It is a gift by which creation of image-bearers of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of good to the church , but not everything that he left to the church in his wake was good . One of the clearest examples was his view of sexuality . Augustine came to Christ out of a very licentious immoral lifestyle , and his mother Monica prayed for him . He finally came to Christ and was saved out of this but because of the way of life he lived before he was a Christian he was convinced that sexuality was evil , that it was inherently evil . Therefore , the only justification for a sexual relationship was procreation . Hence the Roman Catholic view against any kind of birth control and the Roman Catholic view that unless you are able to procreate then sexuality is wrong , unjustified . Furthermore it you can avoid sexuality altogether , even better . So celibacy is this highest ideal before God . The problem with this is 99 % of us were not made by God to have the gift . I believe God gives the gift to some . He says this in 1 Corinthians 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and praise God for single people . <p> A dear woman friend of mine who I love in the Lord and respect so very very highly is Nancy Demoss . She took Elizabeth Elliot 's place on the radio and writes wonderful books . She wrote a wonderful book called ' ' Lies Women Believe ' ' . It is one of the best books for women that I know of anywhere out there . Nancy Demoss is a single woman about my age , 48-49 years old , and is very content in her singleness . She knows that God has given this gift to her so she can devote more time to ministry in ways that he has called her do . Some are given this gift , but most are not . So when you create the ideal of celibacy for a group of people who are not celibate , that is , people who do n't have the gift of it , what are you doing ? It is pretty obvious is n't it ? This idea has just caused enormous harm because it denies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibility <p> God gives a moral command to the man in the garden ; this is an amazing thing . We are morally responsible . When they sin God comes to them and demands an accounting , as he will for every one of us . We will all stand before the bar of justice one day , every one of us . So we have this enormous weight that none of the rest of the created order in this world carries . Of course angels are moral beings as well , but dogs and fishes and cats and octopuses do n't have this burden of moral responsibility that is huge , and there is no doubt it is part of what it means to in the image of God , to love , to worship , to obey , to keep a promise . To keep a promise is godlike to do that . Your dog can never do that , can never keep a promise . When you do that you are godlike . <p> e . Equality yet differentiation in the creation of man and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made in the image of God ; both are human ; both before God are equal in importance , value , rights , dignity . But man is man not woman , woman is woman not man . The differences are to be respected just as the equality is to be respected . Currently we live in a culture that has set aside the differences and respects only the equality of men and women . What Scripture calls us to do is respect the equality and respect the difference . If we do n't respect the differences among us we do n't function right because the differences have so much to do with how we function as men and women . Are there differences in creation ? Yes . <p> Here are seven reason for thinking that God intended us to see in the created order male headship , that Adam was head over Eve , that there was an authority structure , that Eve was to submit to Adam . This was true in the garden before there was sin . <p> ' ' ' 1 ) Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the point that they needed each other , could n't he have created her first ? Yes he could have but he did n't so the question comes is there a reason that he created Adam first ? Or did he just flip a coin ? Was it totally arbitrary ? We know the answer to that because Paul tells us in 1 Timothy 2:13 and 1 Corinthians 11:8 . <p> 1 Tim 2:13 For it was Adam who was first created , and then Eve . <p> 1 Cor 11:8 For man does not originate from woman , but woman from man ; <p> God creating man first and then the woman indicates male authority . If we have the Apostle Paul telling us that is the point of it , we ought to accept that . <p> ' ' ' 2 ) Woman was made for the man 's sake . ' ' ' a helper suitable for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 Cor 11:8 For man does not originate from woman , but woman from man ; 1 Cor 11:9 for indeed man was not created for the woman 's sake , but woman for the man 's sake . <p> So we have again in a clear statement from Paul that this meant to mean something to us ; she was made to assist him . God had already given him his calling in that garden . He was to tend the garden , name the animals , exercise rulership and stewardship , and God gives the woman to him as a helpmate , helper to him in accomplishing that . <p> ' ' ' 3 ) The man named the woman both before and after sin . ' ' ' <p> I find both of these significant because it indicates that sin does not make any difference with male headship . Before sin God brought the woman to the man and he called her ' ' ishshah ' ' for she was taken from ' ' ish ' ' . And then after sin Genesis 3:20 he named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is to indicate authority over . <p> ' ' ' 4 ) Eve was taken from or out of Adam ' ' ' <p> She was made from his side or from his rib . Paul indicates in 1 Corinthians 11:9 that there is something significant about that . He is called the image and glory of God , and she is called the glory of the man . It does n't mean that she is the not image of God , but how is she the image of God ? Because she is taken from the man , she is bone of his bone , flesh of his flesh . Her being made in the image of God is derivative from the man and dependent upon the man . Again an indicator that he is perceived as having headship in the relationship . <p> ' ' ' 5 ) Adam is given primary responsibility in the garden . ' ' ' <p> If God were egalitarian in his mindset , it would make a lot more sense to create the man then the woman and then tell both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both . God did n't do that . He created the man , and he gives him the job description . He gives him the moral command in regards to the tree of knowledge and the tree of life . And he tells her what these things are . So clearly he sees the man as ultimately bearing that responsibility before him . <p> ' ' ' 6 ) In Chapter three the tempter comes to the woman . ' ' ' <p> I think that indicates his understanding of male headship and turning it on its head . Satan acknowledges male headship by the very fact that he goes to the woman instead of the man . In other words he subverts what God had designed . Who sinned first ? The woman takes the fruit , eats of it and then she gives to husband who is with her and he eats . So she sinned first , but who does God come to first ? Adam where are ? Give an account . So God holds Adam accountable , and this is confirmed in Romans 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , not Eve , that is passed on to the whole human race . It is his sin that is the fountainhead for all human sin and not hers , even though she sinned first . Adam tried to make that point ; the woman you gave me. she gave me fruit of the tree . It did n't work . God held him accountable for this . <p> These are reasons for thinking that God intended from the very beginning for there to be male headship . Equality in essence . Men who treat their wife or treat women generally as inferior invite the judgment of God . <p> 1 Pet 3:7a You husbands in the same way , live with your wives in an understanding way , as with someone weaker , since she is a woman ; <p> He has just told wives in the previous six verses to submit to their husbands even if they are not believers , and to have a gentle and quiet spirit so that it may lead them to Christ . So he just made the point that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difference . Yes , there is male headship . That is not denied , but here is the rest of the verse . <p> 1 Pet 3:7b and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered . <p> Do you understand what that means ? Honor her as one who is absolutely equal with you in everything you share in Christ . She , with you , is a co-heir of everything . Do n't you dare treat her as less than an equal in Christ or your prayers will not be heard . We husbands ought to fear when we read that . How important is it to be a praying husband and father ? You do not want to be in a position where God will not hear your prayers . So honor your wife as a co-heir . <p> So there is both equality and difference in creation . <p> Class questions ( the questions are inaudible ) <p> I think we are less fully expressive of what human beings are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies to be used in a particular way . Everyone of those aspects , mind , heart , will , body , has been used for purposes that are both dishonoring to God and destructive of our well being that are in conflict with our created design . In that sense we are less human , less fully expressive of what it is to be human than Christ was . Christ lived an authentically human life . He obeyed the Father every moment of every day . That is the authentic human existence . We have it all wrong when we think that authentic human existence is freedom to do anything we want to do , go anywhere we want to go , feel anything we want to feel , experience anything we want to experience . This is in exact conflict with the way Jesus lived his life and he was fully human . Jesus said , I do not do anything that the Father does n't tell me to do ; I do n't speak anything the Father has not told me to speak . In John 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine you will follow me , and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free . Live like me , and you will be free . Freedom is not doing anything I feel like doing , it is doing exactly what God wants me to do . That is freedom . So human existence as God designed it is marred horribly by sin that pulls in autonomy from God , independence from God . <p> Why does God use masculine language ? <p> There are some feminine metaphors on occasion in Scripture but no descriptive terms that are used of God are feminine ; all are masculine : King , or Lord or Father but not mother or queen or something else like that . I think the main reason is that God has created human beings male and female in such a way that he invested authority in male headship . So he depicts himself in the role of male , not that he is male ; he is not , but because he is the chief authority over us . So he is Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . He is Lord over all of us in that sense . A similar thing can be said of Christ and the church . He is the bridegroom ; we are the bride . Then the question becomes how come these men are the bride ? That is a hard thing to swallow , for men to think that way , that we are in the role of submission to the Groom . So God is not male but he deliberately casts himself in the place of the male , using masculine terms to depict that . This is why I think that there is a contradiction in the egalitarian movement . It is one of those points of tension that wo n't last forever . Conservative egalitarians are conservative on the evangelical spectrum because they believe in inerrancy and so on , but they are egalitarian because they believe there is no distinction between male and female . They are in favor of women 's ordination and believe in mutual submission in the home for husband and wife ; there is no significance to the male in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female are completely equal . But they also hold that God ought to be called Father , that the language of the Bible ought to be retained , that it is dominantly masculine and exclusively masculine in terms of denotation . Never is God referred to as a woman in any way shape or form , but he often times is referred to as a man , Father King or something . How do you maintain this ? How do you account for the masculine language if at the human level there is no significance to male authority ? What is the point of this ? The answer to that question , according to egalitarians is we do n't know , there really is no answer . I have written an article about this you can read in the JBMW ( The Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood ) . It is also in this book that just came out by Eric Johnson . I wrote a chapter in there on the Trinity , and you can see it in that book as well . <p> I think what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw the conclusion that because there is no significance for male authority , we also ought not continue calling God Father ; we ought not to use masculine terms because that perpetuates the notion that there is something about male that has headship or authority . In other words these two things do n't square with one another . This one that affirms God in masculine terms undermines our egalitarian view of men and women over here . I fully anticipate the movement going in the direction of moving toward embracing the notion of gender inclusive language ' ' vis a vis ' ' God which they have n't done yet for the most part , but I anticipate that will probably come to that . One of the reasons that we are concerned about the TNIV , with the gender language , is just what they have done , period . But another reason is that the next step is going to be God language . God is going to become parent instead of Father and Jesus wo n't be the Son of God but the child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this but they are not used by evangelicals . But that is around the corner ; you know that this is where this is heading . <h> B. Note on the Historicity of Adam and Eve <h> 1 . Biblical support for Adam and Eve as the first human pair <p> You are probably aware of the fact that this has been disputed by many critical scholars . Ever since Darwin 's evolutionary theory took hold in the late 19th century this has been a question ; whether or not you can hold that Adam and Eve are a literal pair of human beings . In fact , some people who claim to be evangelical are waffling on this these days . It just astonishes me that this would be the case . Evangelical scholarship is not what it was ten years ago in terms of the centrist positions that were held by most . There are all kinds of people out there who claim to be evangelical who are proposing all kinds of views that are unacceptable altogether . One of them is here . Should we as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human pair . Yes . For example , when you read in Scripture that Adam lived a certain number of years and had children , is he treated any differently than other of the individuals in the book of Genesis ? You have to ask yourselves that question . Does the author want us to think of Adam as a special case , a mythical figure ? Think of chapter five of Genesis . <p> Gen 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam . In the day when God created man , he made him in the likeness of God . Gen 5:2 He created them male and female , and he blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created . Gen 5:3 When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years , he became the father of a son in his own likeness , according to his image , and named him Seth . Gen 5:4 Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years , and he had other sons and daughters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hundred and thirty years , and he died . <p> If you ask the question , " What is the author 's intended meaning of that ? " would n't you have to say he intends us to understand Adam just the same way we would any of the other figures in the book of Genesis whom he portrays as real historical people who had children , who lived a certain number of years , and did certain things and died at a certain age . So there is absolutely no basis in Genesis for thinking Adam is a special case . He is a human being like all others . <p> In 1 Chronicles 1 , the very first word of the book of 1 Chronicles ( the first 10 chapters are genealogies ) is Adam . It starts the chronology . The human race starts with Adam . Does the Chronicler view Adam as the first human being ? Yes . <p> Does the New Testament view Adam as historical ? Yes . Luke 3:38 records Adam at the end of Luke 's genealogy of Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God . <p> Each one of them has a father who is a son of so and so all the way through to Adam who is the son of God . Here we come to the end of the line of the human race , and it 's Adam created by God . <p> Romans 5:12 and following speaks of this one man who brought sin to the entire human race and of course he is talking about Adam , there is no question that is what he is referring to.In 1 Corinthians 15:22,45 Adam is named . <p> 1 Cor 15:22 For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive . <p> 1 Cor 15:45 So also it is written , " The first , Adam , became a living soul . " The last Adam became a life-giving spirit . <p> In Romans 5:12 and following it is clear he is talking about Adam through this one sin , one transgression that happened sin came to whole human race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you account for the origin of sin in the human race ? Paul clearly indicates this is an actually literal transgression . It is as actual and literal as the action is literal of the redemption in Christ as spoken of in Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 . As in Adam all died , in Christ all are made alive . They are both historical genuine individuals . <p> First Timothy 2:13,14 speak of Adam and Eve as real people . <p> 1 Tim 2:13 For it was Adam who was first created , and then Eve . 1 Tim 2:14 And it was not Adam who was deceived , but the woman being deceived , fell into transgression . <p> Likewise 1 Corinthians 11:8,9 speak of the man and woman in the garden . Paul goes back to the garden to talk of the role of men and women relationship and talks about the two of them . <p> 1 Cor 11:8 For man does not originate from woman , but woman from man ; 1 Cor 11:9 for indeed man was not created for the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So is it clear that Adam and Eve are human beings created by God ? Yes . <h> 2 . A comment on Genesis 1-3 and the theory of microevolution <p> Micro evolution is not a problem for anybody , any Christian , anyone . In this room we have some people of different races in one room yet we believe that Adam and Eve were not simultaneously Caucasian , African American , or Asian . Whatever <p> they were , they were one thing . From this one pair has come this variety of human beings that we call races . That is microevolution ; it is small genetic changes that are within a species , within a species boundaries . What the Bible denies is macroevolution , that is changes that produce new species . Changes can be multiplied so you end up with a species that did n't exist before . Now this one has lungs , where there were n't lungs before . Now you have wings , or now you have eyes , and all of these things come about . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in the water . Read works by Phillip Johnson , Bill Dembski , Michael Behe ; this whole movement of Intelligent Design has produced a lot of material in the last ten years that is devastating to Darwinian Macroevolution . <p> Biblically , God created individual species , as he says for example in Genesis 1:20 <p> Gen 1:20 Then God said , " Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens . " Gen 1:21 God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves , with which the waters swarmed after their kind , and every winged bird after its kind ; and God saw that it was good . <p> This indicates that he creates the species and it propagates after its kind . Back in 1865 when Darwin 's Origin of the Species was published there was a huge excitement about going out there , digging up the fossil record and finding what they anticipated , namely evidence of small changes that had the cumulative effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fossil record . One hundred thirty five years later the fossil record has shown instead two very stubborn facts . Number one is sudden appearance ; species all of a sudden appear without any previous history . In other words , there is no previous fossil record showing incremental changes that lead up to this . It is just bang ; it is fully formed and complex with no evidence of where it came from . The second thing is stasis , stability . Yes , there are small changes within species , but they stay pretty much the same as long as they are here , and then they die out in some cases , or in other cases they continue . Sudden appearance and stasis fits Genesis one beautifully . God created it , and it reproduces after its kind . <p> So the fact of the matter is that for biblical reasons we have every reason to believe that Adam and Eve were the literal first human pair . Scientifically , we have absolutely no reason to bow our heads in some kind of embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible teaches us is in fact what we find in life and the record of life on this planet . It is really wonderful . What a difference it is now than what it was in the beginning of the 20th century . What a difference a hundred years can make on this issue because of how much more knowledge we have acquired in that time . It is clear that the scientific record is strongly supportive of what Christians have claimed ; life is by God 's design ; it comes fully formed , and it reproduces after its kind . 
@@35723424 @4723424/ <h> Seams in the Canonical and Covenantal Structure <p> In our previous lecture , I finished the basic eight box outline of the Bible . Now you can see that on this overhead or on the handout that you have or that is available on the website . It has the eight boxes . The eight boxes have written above them the Law , the Prophets and the Writings . And they have written below them Covenant , Covenant History , Covenant Life , Covenant Prologue and Covenant Epilogue . So you can see that all of my descriptive labels from Prologue down to Covenant , Covenant History , Covenant Life and Covenant Epilogue are covenantally prefixed . That is , every one of them has covenant in it , because covenant is what structures the canon . And what makes our writings canonical is their covenantal nature . That which is canonical is by definition covenantal . <p> If you are interested in more detailed arguments about that and the relationship of it and how that works with documentary clauses and depository clauses in the ancient world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority . That will really help . You could also read Treaty of the Great King , by Meredith Kline , and that will also help , because he covers some of the same material there . That is a really good place to go . <h> I. Review of the Eight Boxes <p> By way of review , what we want to do now is " if you are taking a new set of notes , it is not a bad idea to draw your eight boxes up again with a blank piece of paper . We are going to start talking about how those boxes are sewn or glued together , the seams . We are going to talk about little seams , micro-seams , between the Law and the Prophets and the Prophets and the Writings . And we will talk about testamental seams , that is , seams between the Old and New Testament . And then we will talk about massive canonical framing things that we have already alluded to . <p> Let us draw our eight boxes . Really , this eight box grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a most helpful way for looking at and viewing , in pictorial fashion , the entire structure of the Old Testament canon and the New Testament canon . It is the entire structure of our Christian Bible . And we will put up here Law , Prophets and Writings . We will put on the bottom Covenant , Covenant History and Covenant Life . Then we will put our Prologue and our Epilogue , just so we can identify where we are in the boxes . <p> Then again , I will number the boxes so it is easier to describe them . The prologue box will get a zero and the epilogue box will get a seven . The bottom register of boxes " those New Testament Covenant , Covenant History and Covenant Life boxes " we give those one , two and three . Then the upper register or Old Testament " Law , Prophets and Writing books " we are going to call four , five and six . This is just a way of numbering the boxes so that we can talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing really magical about those numbers , except that they do happen to correspond to the structure and the presentation of the days in the book of Genesis ( the days of creation in Genesis 1 and 2 ) . We will talk about that at another date and time . So those are our boxes . <h> II . Canonical Seams <p> Now we want to talk about what I am calling , and what others call perhaps , as a metaphor , canonical seams . Now what is a canonical seam ? Well a seam is the place at which two parts are joined together . If you are thinking about a garment , there is a seam between the body of the shirt and the sleeve . There is a seam in my shirt right here that connects the body of the shirt with the sleeve itself . There is seams in your pants that hold the front part of your pants together to the back part of your pants , so that they are staying on and appropriate . You know if your pants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , you can split the seam . And that is an embarrassing thing . So you know what a seam is . <p> Now in the Bible , when we talk about canonical seams , that is the place at which different sections of the Bible connect or butt up to each other . So , for example , there is a canonical seam between the Law and the Prophets . The " Canonicler " " that is another word we are going to use . What I mean by Canonicler is whoever put the Bible together in its final form . We do not know who that is . We may guess Ezra . We may guess Nehemiah . We may guess Judas Maccabee for our Old Testament canon . Who knows ? Paul or John ? We do not know who put together the New Testament in its final form . We do know from the manuscript evidence , however , that at least by the early second century it was circulating in a final form . <p> So we are going to talk about those seams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is going to be a seam that exists between the Prophets and the Writings in the Old Testament . There is also going to be a seam for us between the Old and the New Testament . We are going to talk about the seam of how Chronicles and the book an inseparable way . I will do it this way . I will say it kind of provocatively this way : you can not understand Matthew without knowing that Chronicles is the book that comes right before it . Matthew is theologically geared to be the answer to the book of Chronicles . It is not the answer to the book of Malachi . Of course it is in some sense , but really we are talking about how the canon is set up . <p> You can think about that seam being kind of right here at the right-hand corner of boxes six and three or at the left hand corner of boxes one and four . But if you are looking at the Bible in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Testament literature and then you have got the event of the life and ministry and crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus in the center and then you have got a line of New Testament literature , that seam would be right here at the cross . What sews the Old and New Testament canonically as a document . These lines represent literature , not history . That is what we are looking at there and so we are going to do that . <h> a . Review of the Binding : the Introduction and Conclusion <p> To begin with we are going to talk about seams " what I call divisional seams : seams between the Law , the Prophets and the Writings . What I want to look at first is not necessarily a seam . Let me just review . If we have a book and we have a binding that is sewn together , what holds that binding together is the book cover . We do have a book cover that holds all the seams together as well . We talked about that yesterday . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 2 you have creation and then marriage and then Satan in that A-B-C pattern . In the book of Revelation , chapters 20 to 22 , you have those same three topics discussed but in reverse order . You have Satan then marriage and then creation . And those are not necessarily seams , but it is the book cover that encapsulates everything . It holds the seams together . So before we talk about the seams , it is appropriate to remind you that , in the midst of those seams , what is holding the whole thing together is that great big chiasm : creation , marriage and Satan , Satan , marriage and creation and all the totality that exists between them . A-B-C , C-B-A : you know you are done when you repeat the same thing in reverse order . It is the closing of the canon . That is the book ends . Nothing exists outside of those book ends , for me. <h> b . Divisional Seams <p> Now , let 's talk about our first seam right here : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we are going to find in the Old Testament is that there is a seam at the end of the Law and the beginning of the Prophets . And then we are going to find there is seam at the end of the Prophets and the beginning of the Writings . And the seams at the ending or the termination point of each part of the canon correspond . And the seams at the beginning of each part of the new sections in the canon correspond . So it can not be an accidental construction . They are intentional seams . They are produced either originally and under divine providence and inspiration came together like this , or by the Canonicler , or some combination thereof . The Canonicler under divine inspiration may be the best description . But we just simply do not know . <h> 1 . At the End of the Law <p> So let 's begin with the end of the Law which is Deuteronomy 34:10-12 . At the end of the book of Deuteronomy , there is this accounting of Moses ' death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . And then later it talks about " and ever since that time no prophet has arisen in Israel like him " , which means there is a significant time gap for historical recollection . Let me just read Deuteronomy 34:10-12 for you . Deuteronomy 34 includes the death of the blesser . We talked about that . In the end of Genesis , you have the blessing of the twelve tribes and the death of the one who blesses , Jacob . Here you have Deuteronomy 33 , the blessing of the twelve tribes , and then the death of the blesser . So here is the end of the Law , the death of the blesser . <p> Deuteronomy 34:10-12 , " Since then , " that is the death of Moses , " no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face , who did all these miraculous signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do in Egypt to Pharaoh and to all of his officials and to his whole land . For no one has ever shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in the sight of Israel . " This is the conclusion that is written in a way that pushes you eschatologically forward in search of the ultimate prophet . <p> At the end of the book of Deuteronomy there is this statement . It has to be historically distant from the actual event of the death , because the author of that text is saying : " Since that time , we have never had a prophet like him . " We had Nathan and Gad , but they are not even close to Moses . We have had Isaiah " and boy , that guy could write . We had Jeremiah . He was good on the whole new covenant thing . We had Ezekiel . He had some great stuff on the temple and some great visions about the throne-room of God . But since that time , there has been no prophet like him . We had Elijah and Elisha . They did a lot of great and cool and miraculous things , but nothing like Moses . No one has ever written like Moses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Moses you have all of these great things . He was the ruler , the covenant mediator , the judge . He did all that kind of stuff . He performed miracles and there has been no prophet like him . <p> So at the end of Deuteronomy , in chapter 34 , it is pushing you forward . It is saying : " Go on , go on . There is more . You have got to look for the prophet . Look for the prophet who is to come . " Now , we know earlier in Deuteronomy , there are the laws for identifying a prophet and who a prophet will be and what he will be like and what are the false prophets and stuff like that . So , there is some anticipation of the office the prophet having a form of continuity in it that will ultimately look for the ultimate prophet . And here the guy has got to the end and reflected on this and said : " Hey , since this time there has been no prophet like Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prophet like Moses . <p> We know , because we have got the answer key , who that ultimate prophet is . It is the guy who is down in this category right here . If you are reading in your blocks , you are not in a linear thing . This is not in a linear fashion , like we do normally in our western minds . But if you are reading in your eight blocks , numbered zero through seven , when you get here and at the end you say : " Hey , there has never been a guy like Moses ever , ever since . " But down here you get the answer to that . The anticipation is over for us . We have got in the lower block , block one , the answer to the problem . We have the Prophet who has come and superseded Moses . <p> And we have seen how he superseded Moses . Yesterday , we talked about the discontinuity between the Old Testament Gospels and the New Testament Gospels . And we could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He did not speak on behalf of the Lord , but He spoke as the Lord . And secondly , He was not able just to ask to be an atonement for the people , He indeed was the atonement for His people . So , not only is He a prophet like Moses , but He is a prophet way beyond Moses . That is good news . That is the gospel . So that is at the end of the Law . <h> 2 . At the End of the Prophets <p> Now , let 's skip to the end of the Prophets " to the end of our second seam . We will talk about the seam at the end of the Prophets , specifically the Latter Prophets . At this point we are going to look at Malachi 4:4-6 . Now , in Malachi 4 , really the message of Malachi ends in verse 2 . You are done . Then something exists at the end where I do not know if Malachi himself wrote it or the Canonicler did ( that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the same fellow who wrote those words at the end of Deuteronomy is also writing these words for us . Perhaps he is giving us a hermeneutical clue for how we are to read the Bible or an interpretational clue , a sign post . When you get to a crossroad on a trip and you need to know which way to go , you are looking for the signs . You come to the end of this portion of the canon and you need a sign to know which way to go . At the end of Malachi , you have another one of those . <p> Here it is , it says : " Remember the law of My servant Moses . " So again , he is pointing you back . " The decrees and laws I gave to him at Horeb for all of Israel . See , I will send you the prophet Elijah , " in the future , " before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes . He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else I will come and strike the land with a curse . " Now this conclusion to the Prophets points us back to the Law with the mention of Moses . But it also points us forward to look for someone like Elijah who will herald the eschatological day of the Lord . <p> Now we know . We have the answer key . We know who the eschatological Elijah is . It is John the Baptist . And so again , you have the end of the Law pushing us forward to look for the greater Moses and the end of the Prophets pushing us forward to look to the return of Elijah ( the one who will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and so on ) . These seams do not have a textual function . That is , it is not really a part of the message of Deuteronomy or a part of the message of Malachi . It is part of the message of the canon as a whole . It is macro-canonical seams . It is above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canon . <p> So these seams , the seams at the end of each section , are eschatological in that they are pointing you forward to look for this ultimate prophet and this prophet who will herald that other prophet . Let me put it this way : the end of the Law and the end of the Prophets are demanding that you look for the New Testament documents . They are demanding that you read on . That is what they are doing . <h> 3 . At the Beginning of the Prophets <p> Now let me talk about the seams at the beginning of the Prophets and at the beginning of the Writings . So you can see how we are going to be talking about , at these seams , a place on either side of the seam . You have got to sew the stitch on both sides if you want a strong connection . If you look , for example , here you can see there is even more going on under here than there is up here . <p> At the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophets because Joshua , Judges , Samuel and Kings head up that section ) , there is an imperative to do something that is very important . I may have mentioned this before . In Joshua 1:8 it says this : " Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth . Meditate be prosperous and successful . " Now , you may think that is just a good quote . You could have it anywhere and it is just darn good advice . If there was ever any wisdom literature that was wise , that is it : Think upon God 's word . Well it is strategically placed for two reasons . <p> First is that it is heading up the first part of the new section : the first part of the first new section ever in the Bible . You have Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy . That part of the canon is closed : sacrosanct , Mosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So when you get to the new section , you want to know what is this really about . You want to know what is the key thing and what is important . At the very first instance , the very first thing they say is : " Hey , we are all about the law of God . You are to meditate on that law day and night . And everything that follows in this section will be reflections on , expressions of , realities pertaining to the law of God . " In other words , you must interpret the Prophets through the lens of the Torah or the Pentateuch or the Mosaic material , especially Exodus through Deuteronomy . <p> I would say this as well . You have to view Exodus through Deuteronomy through the lens of Genesis . So now you have your Genesis glasses on and now you have your Exodus through Deuteronomy glasses on and now you are viewing the Former and the Latter Prophets in that light . <h> 4 . At the Beginning of the Writings <p> Now , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of God day and night seems to be a common and nice and wise saying , it actually only occurs two times in this form . Is n't that interesting ? Of all the places it could occur , it happens to occur for the second time in the first chapter of the writings . So you have this imperative to meditate on God 's word day and night in the Prophets . And then you have a similar description of that reality in the Writings . For example , in Psalm 1:2 it talks about the righteous and says : " But his delight is in the law of the Lord and on His law he will meditate day and night . " <p> So like the seam at Joshua 1:8 , this introduction is a hermeneutical push backwards . It reminds readers that all of the following is based upon and is to be interpreted through the lens of the Law . So you have got these two unique expressions at the beginning of the Prophets and at the beginning of the Writings . They are pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ultimately based upon the Mosaic legislation , the law , the law of God . <p> And that helps you to understand it . That helps you to understand why Israel is constantly getting into trouble . It is because they are disobeying this law . That helps you to understand a lot of the Wisdom Literature . Why would you do certain things the way the book of Proverbs says ? Why would you praise God with the Psalms ? Why would you live a life that is counter to Ecclesiastes ' anti-wisdom ? Only if you were in covenant relationship with Yahweh . None of it makes sense without that covenant " without the formal relationship between Israel and Yahweh . It could not happen . It does not make sense . It would be nonsensical . So those things push you back . <h> 5 . The Importance of the Three-Fold Division <p> You have here then , at the end of the Law and the beginning of the Prophets and at the end of the Prophets and the beginning of the Writings , intentional canonical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the end of the Prophets push you forward looking for the ultimate prophet . The seams at the beginning of the Prophets and the beginning of the Writings push you backwards and say : When you look for that prophet , remember he has got to correspond to the Law . He has got to be born under the law " those kinds of things . <p> So the canon is intentionally sewn together at this point . What these seams show us is , first , the importance of the three-fold division of the Hebrew Bible . These seams do not exist when you have a four-fold division , especially in this nice parallel way where you have got the two ending seams being forward-looking and the two beginning seams being backward-looking . Do you see how they crisscross ? You have got them going backwards and backwards and then forwards and forwards . That is how you have a nice stitch : backwards and forwards , backwards and forwards , backwards and forwards . It just makes such good sense . Again , it is another reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it constructed that way and then sewn together , it shows you that it is not an accident . These books have not been blocked that way accidentally . It is not just a nice and interesting description , but I could take it or leave it . <p> If you rip those blocks asunder , you are ripping the seams apart . Have you ever tried to rip a shirt or a garment at the seams ? What happens ? It tears the whole garment . It no longer works the same way . You can not ever put the garment back the same way , because you have destroyed the seams . It is no longer useful in the same way . We do not want to tear the garment of the Biblical canon . We want to keep it together . Does that make sense ? <h> c . The Testamental Seams <p> Now , let me talk about a different kind of seam . At this point , I want to talk about what I mentioned earlier : the testamental seams . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament . We are going to do that by looking at Chronicles and Matthew . <p> Now , it may not be obvious , since we are not necessarily familiar with the Hebrew Bible order . Remember , Chronicles is the last book of my Hebrew Bible . Matthew is the first book of the New Testament . So the question is : Is there a relationship between these two books here that helps to understand the relationship between the Old and New Testament ? And is there a way that says these books are connected showing continuity between the Old and New Testament or discontinuity or at least integration ? Is there something that says they have to go together ? In some sense I have to argue with you . I have to convince you that Chronicles is indeed the most fitting conclusion to the Old Testament and the most fitting preparation for the New Testament . And I have to convince you that Matthew is the most fitting beginning of all the gospels for the New Testament . It is not an accident , that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . <h> 1 . The Genealogies <p> Now , let me begin by giving you a couple of interesting things with regard to Chronicles and Matthew . First , there are only two books in the entire Christian Bible that begin with genealogies . Guess which ones they are . Chronicles and Matthew . There are only two books in the entire Bible that begin with genealogies and they are Chronicles and Matthew . <p> Now that is interesting , because genealogies are placed at points where redemptive history is advancing . You just do not have genealogies because you are feeling nostalgic and you want to look at your ancestors and feel good about where you have come from . In the Old Testament especially , genealogies are given to identify key themes and to advance redemptive history . So when you see a genealogy the size listed in Chronicles , you know that something major is happening . It is not just a genealogy that is few verses long or even a few chapters long . The genealogies in Chronicles constitute nine chapters : 1 Chronicles 1-9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one having a bad day and wanting to be encouraged sits down and reads genealogies like in Chronicles 1-9 . But perhaps if I can get you to think about differently you would . <p> At this point I am not going to talk about the genealogies , because the genealogies do a couple of things for us . The way they are constructed and the way they talk about the tribes and they talk about the world , they do it in concentric circles . The world is the outside circle . Israel is the inside circle . Then you have Judah inside that with the Levites and the temple . So the genealogies in Chronicles provide you with a worldview which has basically Jerusalem as the center of the universe . And the temple is at the center of Jerusalem . And so the temple , Yahweh , is the center of all reality in the universe according to the genealogies in Chronicles. <h> 2 . The Kingship and the Temple <p> But , what is also does is it starts us on the track of looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It introduces a new phase in redemptive history . And then everything that comes after Chronicles rehearses those major points in history , preparing us for something new . If you know anything about Chronicles it traces and highlights basically two things ; the kingship of David and the establishment of the temple . And so Chronicles in its writing ( in its construction ) is preparing us for a new era in redemptive history . It is where there will be some kind of great new David and some kind of great new temple . <p> Because we know that , according to the structure of Chronicles " we have talked about with Ezra , Nehemiah and then Chronicles . Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus in 538 . Chronicles ends with that same decree . Then there is about 138 years of history that is left flat . It is saying that that return from exile is not the one that is being prophesied about by the prophets . It may look like it , but it is not . <p> In fact , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We talked about the glory of the second temple that was being reconstructed . Ezra and Nehemiah come back . Nehemiah really gets the building projects going . You have them wanting to rebuild the walls and the temple . It says in Haggai 2:9 that the glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house . This means that the new temple will outstrip and outshine the Solomonic temple . Let me read it . Haggai 2:9 , " ' The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house , ' says the Lord almighty . ' And in this place I will grant peace declares the Lord Almighty ' . " <p> Now compare this with Ezra 3:12-13 . " But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads who had seen the former temple " Now I am talking about the temple has been rebuilt and they are looking at its foundation . There is a group of elderly gentlemen around who had participated in the first temple . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did . Let me back up and read that again . " But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads , who had seen the former temple , wept aloud when the saw the foundations of this temple being laid , while many others shouted for joy . " <p> Here is the thing . The younger generation who saw it being built and who had never seen it before , were just excited to see it built . They had never seen the temple before . They thought things were going well . But those who had seen the temple in its former glory knew that it was a pale comparison . So they wept because they knew the verse in Haggai . Well , Haggai was around then . Haggai said this temple will be supersized in glory and in its ability to secure peace over the first temple . And it was not . <p> And so Chronicles is recognizing for us , I believe , the failure of the return from exile . It recognizes the failure of what is left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is like those verses , those seams , pointing us forward . We need to be looking for the ultimate Moses and the Elijah that will herald him . We need to be looking for the true David and the new temple whose glory will outstrip everything else . <h> 3 . The Passover <p> Another way that this does this is a very interesting one . It is the significance of the Passover . You may or may not be aware of this , but there are only two places in the Old Testament where the Passover is highlighted or is even a topic of discussion . The first is the exodus event and the second is in Chronicles . That is interesting . You would never assume that the Passover is a big deal , but all you have to do is a lexical study . Look up the word Passover . It is very common in Exodus . Then they talk about the Passover laws in Numbers and Deuteronomy . But it is almost never discussed again in the entire rest of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the end of 2 Chronicles , in the last few chapters of 2 Chronicles . Then you have it nineteen times . Silence for almost 1000 years and then the issue of the Passover is coming again and they are preparing to celebrate the Passover . <p> Now , in Exodus , they celebrated the Passover for exodus : the act of ultimate salvation for them . In Chronicles , they are preparing . Again they are at the end of Passover . And so , what are they going to expect after that ? Yes , deliverance . They expect a new exodus , a supersonic exodus . <p> And so if you see how the canon is structured this way , you are looking for a greater prophet , a greater king , a greater temple and a new exodus . It does not get any better than that . That is amazing . And exodus is a saving event . Remember that . It is a place where the Lord fights as a warrior for His people to bring deliverance . The exodus event is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His people deliverance . <h> 4 . The Warrior <p> This brings me to my third point . How will this happen and who will be the warrior ? Now I can tell you exactly who will be the warrior , because the book of Chronicles ends with a verb in Hebrew : 32:15 Y-haow and it is a very interesting thing for a couple of reasons . First , if you know anything about Hebrew , Hebrew loves its verbs up front . The verb first is the mantra of most Hebrew narrative . Now here , if the verb is last , that is something new . That is something unusual at least . That is something that you should take a look at . And so you begin to take a look at it . <p> And it is this verb let him go up . It is one word , but in English we have to translate it with let him go up , with four words . And so , maybe you are thinking to yourself : " Big deal . That is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is not . In Hebrew , it is a holy war verb : to go up . To let him go up is a holy war verb . Let me give you an example of what I mean . <p> We can also mention here , in this context , there are only two books in the Hebrew Bible that actually end in a verb . This is one of them . And so , it is a rare occurrence . And so , when a book does end in a verb , we need to take note . This is a place where it does . <p> The verb to let him go up is a verb for war and conquest in this way . When Israel was occupying the Promised Land , after the exodus , they would frequently engage an enemy . When you went into battle , you would go up . When as an army you went up , because you had the twelve tribes , there was usually this question by the priest or the leader like Joshua : Who will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord would declare : " This person will go up " or " This tribe will go up " . That is how it would work . <p> Let me give you an example of that . In Joshua 1:1-2 it says : " After the death of Joshua , the people of Israel inquired of the Lord : ' Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them ? ' The Lord said : ' Judah shall go up . Behold , I have given the land into his hand ' . " Think about the book of Judges . There was a lot of war going on there . Judges 20:18 . " The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and inquired of God : ' Who shall go up first for us to fight against the people of Benjamin ? ' And the Lord said : ' Judah shall go up first ' . " <p> So , the book of Chronicles ends with this verb : let him go up . A Jewish man living in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that as a warfare verb . His reflex would be to ask this question : " Well then , who will go up first for us ? " And then , we have to answer our question : Who will go up ? And if we are going to answer that question " well we do not answer it , but the New Testament answers it with the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew . Jesus will go up . What tribe is he from ? Judah . The exact same tribe mentioned in both Joshua and Judges . <p> Remember , the Passover marks the beginning of a redemptive event where God acts as a warrior on behalf of His people to save them . So , we must interpret the life and ministry of Jesus as an act of war where God comes to fight on behalf of His people . Jesus is the new Moses , the one who leads us into or through our second exodus . He is the man of Judah . He is the warrior of Judah who will go up . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not the only one who recognized that . I think that is well-described in Victor Hamilton 's , Introduction to the Historical Books , when he talks about Chronicles . It is a remarkable thing . <p> So you have these two books . There are only two books in the Christian Bible that begin with genealogies . And the one of them ends by asking a question that the other one answers . That is Matthew . <p> And here is the interesting thing when you think about genealogies . In the Old Testament , we have a lot of genealogies starting in Genesis and running all the way through Chronicles . The Old Testament is , in some sense , book-ended by genealogies with lots of them in the middle . And , in the New Testament , we get these genealogies that culminate in Jesus in Matthew and Luke . Then where do you get your next genealogy in the New Testament ? You do n't . There is no new genealogy . Why ? Because you are done . Jesus is the goal of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need any more genealogies because all of creation from Adam on was having as its goal the incarnation of the Son of God to come as a warrior to save us from our sins in an act of warfare . It is remarkable . It is remarkable how that plays out if you read these books in their canonical order like that . <p> Let him go up . Who will go up ? Judah shall go up . Well , which one from Judah ? Jesus . Did he fight ? Yes . Did he win ? Yes . Is he coming back to do it exactly how he did it in Joshua and Judges earlier ? Yes . And it will be even uglier on that day . The book of Revelation makes the genocide of Joshua and Judges seem like kindergarten play-time comparatively . It is massive . It is massive . So there are these seams there . <p> So , in terms of the seam Chronicles and Matthew , you have the issue of the genealogies connecting them and the issues of Passover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Passover lamb . What does John say ? " Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world . " John the Baptist new exactly what was happening there . And then you have the issue of the going up in the warfare . All of that stuff connects these books as we interpret them . <h> 5 . Discussions of Adam <p> It is also interesting , in terms of thinking about the Old Testament perhaps , that there are only two books in the Old Testament that happen to begin with discussions of Adam . Only Genesis and Chronicles begin with Adam " the first and the last book . Is n't that interesting ? So remember how we talked about how Jesus mentions Abel to Zechariah in his description of the martyrs " from Abel in Genesis to Zechariah at the end Chronicles . We were talking about the order of His Bible in that day was Genesis to Chronicles . And we can also say the only two books in the Old Testament who begin with a reference to Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> d . Divisional Seams in the New Testament <p> So there is massive thematic organization to the Old Testament canon by itself . And again , there is massive correspondence to how those New Testament boxes are arranged in one , two and three . We could argue that there are some seams between boxes one and two and two and three in the New Testament . But I am just not as sure yet how those work out . You may not need them because , up here in the Old Testament , you do not have anything to go off . There is no pattern . And so , up here in the Old Testament , you have got to have an intentional sewing together so they know how to keep it together . But down here , once you have got the pattern , the New Testament just falls into line . It follows suit . <h> 1 . The Seam between the Law and the Prophets <p> But you could , if you wanted to think about it , look for some seams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the book of Acts here , you are in Rome . Then , the first book in the Epistles is Romans . So there is some thematic correspondence between those New Testament seams . I am just not as convinced , at this time , about how those seams might work for the New Testament . That may be the downfall of this . <p> But I could say , for example , the New Testament seams between the Law and the Prophets , Acts 1:1-3 says this . Listen to these key words . " In my former book , Theophilus , I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day He was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen . In His suffering He showed Himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that He was alive . He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God . " You see how it has got a lot of that big theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this section here , Jesus and the kingdom of God . And in the midst , you have the Holy Spirit and the apostles who are bearing witness to Jesus and the kingdom of God . See how that works ? And then you get to Romans . <p> Acts is right here at the beginning of this testamental seam . So it is saying : " Hey look . We are starting a new section here in Acts , but we are still on the same topic : Jesus and the kingdom of God as being born witness to by the Holy Spirit and the apostles . " OK , I can jive with that . That is good . Because remember you have Pentecost , the Holy Spirit bearing witness to all that Jesus had done and then you have the apostles , their teaching ministry and their preaching ministry and the coming up of Paul and all that stuff . So what is it about ? It is about this . At the beginning of the book of Acts , it is saying : Jesus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the apostles are bearing witness to it ( to this block , block one ) . It is just like at the beginning of the Prophets in the Old Testament where it says : " Hey , we are all about this . " And just like the beginning of the Writings in the Old Testament it is saying : " Hey , we are all about this law again . " And so at the beginning of the Historical Books in the New Testament , Acts , it is saying : " Hey , we are all about this . " <h> 2 . The Seam between the Prophets and the Writings <p> Now does that play out in Romans as well ? Romans would be the first book of the New Testament Writings . There is quite a bit of correspondence there . It is not as ironclad , for example , as the repetition of meditate day and night , meditate day and night . But there is some correspondence here . <p> Let me read to you Romans 1:1-4 . " Paul , a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set apart for the gospel of God , the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures regarding His Son who , as to his human nature , was a descendant of David and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord . " So here you have the Apostle Paul with the Holy Spirit bearing witness to Jesus Christ through the Scriptures . So there is a lot of correspondence there . But it is not the same tight correspondence that I see in the Old Testament . In the Old Testament , for me , it is ironclad . <p> In the New Testament , there are a lot of things going on here pointing you back . Like , if I read to you this section . Paul is a servant of Jesus Christ , the guy back here . And it is the gospel He promised beforehand up here . It is in the holy Scriptures , regarding His Son , back here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a descendent of David . Through the Spirit of holiness , He was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord . So he is really tying all the canon together there in a lot of different ways . Perhaps it is just I have not had the chance to work through all the details and to come up with as many arguments for it . There is some sense of linkage between the New Testament Writings and the New Testament Covenant , but it is not as ironclad as these two spots . <p> Responds to a question . <p> Testamental seams : Chronicles , genealogy , Passover , let him go up . I think we are done with talking about the seams . What the seam does , for me , is this . Yesterday we kind of wrapped the present and today we put the ribbon on it . We really just tied it up and made it ironclad . This is not accidental . This is intentional and highly structured . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could spend the rest of your life making sense of all this . In fact , what I started with on a sheet of paper has become 31 pages of single-spaced notes . That is just thinking about this stuff . If I tried to write that out longhand , it would be over 100 . And so there is a lot to be done here . But I think there is still enough here to be convinced of the basic argument . <h> III . Conclusions and Implications <p> So let me just give you a few conclusions and implications . I think I have five of them . I will just give these in summary fashion . <h> a . The Bible Exhibits an Intelligent Design <p> Number one . The construction of the Christian Bible , the macro-canon , exhibits an intelligent design . Now , you will know from scientific studies ( if you are into that whole thing ) that the word " intelligent design " is a big apologetic word for trying to prove that there is a God and someone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human document that went through an evolutionary process . They think it is just darn good luck that we have what we have . Based upon what I have seen here and described to you , we have an intelligent design that points both to the ultimate Author and to the ultimate meaning or message of the one book . This is both making sense of the part and , at the same time , recognizing the unified message of the whole . <p> That is a tough thing to do in Biblical studies today , because there is so much controversy and diversity . One of the great things about the Biblical , theological study of the Old Testament and the emerging field of Biblical Theology today is that they are trying to put the parts back together into a coherent whole . We , as confessional Christians , believe that both the Old and the New Testaments are the word of God . He is the primary Author . So the pieces must fit together and make a part of the whole . That must be a coherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or happenstance connection . That is number one . <h> b . The Structure Helps us Understand the Big Picture <p> Number two . The macro-canonical context helps us to understand the big picture . It helps us understand how the Old Testament and New Testament fit together and how the parts of each Testament relate . It helps us to understand how we ought to conduct ourselves in the Biblical house of God . Each room has a function and a purpose within the house and for the purpose of living in that house . <h> 1 . The Relationship between the Old and New Testaments <p> Let me explain to you two things here . First , now I think you can see in picture form the relationship between the Old and the New Testament . Now you may say : " Well , is it law-gospel ? " And I would say : " Well , it is gospel-gospel . " Well , is there a covenant of works in there ? Yes , because if there is no covenant of works , Christ could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that is the gospel . He did something for us that we could not do and He gave it to us . He imputed it to us . <p> You can see this . Let me just put it this way in terms of the relationship between the Old and New Testament that may be helpful . In the book of Genesis , God makes a promise to Abraham . In essence , it is that Abraham 's seed will be the seed of Genesis 3:15 . He will crush the head of the serpent and , through that crushing , he will give him land , descendents and blessing . And the way in which God goes about bringing that promise to fruition is a two-fold way . <p> You can think about the " already " in the Old Testament and the " not yet here " for Abraham . And so the first way in which God goes about fulfilling the promises to Abraham is the Old Testament : Exodus through Chronicles . He lays down the Mosaic legislation , or He sets forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " OK Abraham , here is My promise to you . Here is the way I am going to fulfill it . Here is the law . " Now , that is really not fair play . Could anyone ever keep that law ? No . Was an Israelite ever intended to keep that law ? No . It was impossible from the beginning . That is demonstrated by the episode of the Golden Calf . <p> And I would say , if you read Exodus 17 and the striking of the rock , the striking of the rock is the gospel . That sets forth the significance of the entire law . Remember this : the law is not given until Exodus 20 . But in Exodus 17 , the people sue God for breach of contract . They say He is not being a faithful suzerain or a faithful king . And so God has them execute a judicial case right there on the spot . You may recall the narrative . God says to Moses : " Take your staff , the staff with which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders and have them pass before the rock as witnesses . " Then God said : " I will stand on the rock . Moses , you will take your staff and you will hit the rock . " And so when Moses stands before the rock and he hits the rock , who is he hitting ? God . He is hitting God . On that day , on that rock , in Exodus 17 , Moses strikes Yahweh with the god-damning staff that he struck the Nile with . Remember , all those Nile plagues were focused at the Egyptian gods . That is why you can call it the god-damning staff of the Nile . That is what it is . God became damned on that day in Exodus in order to save the people from their sins . He saved them from their thirst , to preserve them in the desert so they would not die . It was so He would not kill them . <p> And in 1 Corinthians 10 , Paul tells us that the Person on that rock was Jesus . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people before even obedience was a possibility to secure the covenant . <p> Responds to an interjection . <p> He becomes the living water . So , even before the law was given , God was promising that He would take upon the covenant curses of that law , in order to provide life for His people . So when you read the book of Deuteronomy and you get to the section of all those curses and you think : " O my gosh . That is one cranky God to have all those curses . " But I read those curses and almost weep every time . Why ? Because every curse God stipulates in the book of Deuteronomy for breaking the covenant , that is the curse He is going to put on His Son to save you . Those are not curses for us in Christ . Those are curses for God who will save us from our sins by taking those curses for us . <p> If anything is cranky , Old Testament works " nasty , crusty law " it is those covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the work of Christ on your behalf , they become the greatest joy-inflicting message of all time . It transforms everything you know and you think about in terms of the law . It is remarkable . And so what happens here is God lays down , in Exodus through Deuteronomy , a covenant of works that no one can ever keep . So , if He is going to bestow the Abrahamic blessings upon us through this covenant of works , not only does God have to keep it Himself , but He has also to pay the price for those who disobey it . This must happen for those He wants to bring into His house . <p> Does that ever happen ? Yes , right here , in this new covenant . Jesus perfectly fulfills this law . But then , in the midst of his perfect fulfillment ( at which time He could have received all those blessings ) , He undergoes the curse that we deserved . He does this so that He could impute His righteousness to us . That is the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is set up for us in this works of the law in the Old Testament , so that it could be placed upon us , or secured for us , by the work of Another in an unbreakable fashion . <p> So the work of Jesus means that , when we are in Christ , we are free from the law . Why ? According to Galatians it is because we keep it in Christ . He kept it for us . This no longer reigns over us . It has been perfectly kept . All the curses in it have been done away with . We only exist under those blessings because of the work of Christ in our behalf . That is remarkable . Now that is the theological umph of it . <h> 2 . The Structure Provides Hermeneutical Equipment <p> What do I mean by it helps us to understand how we ought to conduct ourselves in the Biblical house of God ? This is an important thing in terms of hermeneutics . I want you to look at these eight boxes for a moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps box zero is your garage . Box one is your living room . Box four is your dining room . Box seven is your bedroom and stuff like that . One of the things that is helpful to think about this is you must conduct yourself in your house in different rooms in different ways . Perhaps you do not think about this . I do not park my car in my bedroom , because the bedroom is for another activity . It is not fitted for vehicles . Nor do I go to the bathroom in the kitchen . That would cause some problems because the kitchen does not have the appliances necessary for all of that . Think about this . If you want to really freak out one of your friends , invite him over for dinner and cook dinner in your bathroom for him . Would not that put an edge on the situation ? Would not he say : " Let me take you out to McDonald 's right now ; do not put in all that effort " ? So each room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each room to get the most out of it . If you continually park your car in the bathroom , you are going to have to do renovations pretty soon . <p> Now here is the thing . I believe that these boxes are very similar to that . Each one requires that we conduct ourselves a little bit differently . In some of them , we are looking for instructions on how to live day-to-day . We have the room for that : the Writings . In other ones , we are trying to figure out : " Who is God ? What has He done for me ? What does He require of me ? " . We have that . Those are called the Covenant Books . And then you can say : " What is the life of the people of God in the midst of the covenant look like ? " . You have these prophets . <p> So that is why I said earlier : " You can dare to be a Daniel . " Its position in the canon demands that . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of Covenant Life . He is trying to tell you how to think and live in light of God 's covenant . But you can not say , for example : " Dare to be a Stephen . Go to court and get yourself stoned . " He is doing something there unique in redemptive history that is non-repeatable . It happened once for all . It is a final event . It is marking the beginning of a new age in redemptive history . You can not dare to be a David , because there are not any of you in here who are the anointed Messianic king of Yahweh . I can not tell you : " Dare to be a Moses . " Not many of us have had the opportunity to speak to a burning bush , to have a staff that can turn into a snake or to part rivers . Moses had a very unique office and experience that is unrepeatable , except for only one person . Most of the folks in the Old Testament were driving you to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is how we normally interpret the Judges . Let me give you a little hint here . You look at the life of a judge like Samson . We can use him as a paradigm . Here is the application we normally draw from Samson . Samson was used by God , even though he was a sinner . If God can use Samson , surely he can use you . You may be bad , but you are not as bad as Samson . You are not killing people . You are not an adulterer . You are not marrying people . You are not being unequally yoked . You are not sleeping with a prostitute , as some think that Samson did . And if God can use Samson for His purposes , then he can certainly use you . Pull yourself up by your moral boot-straps and please God . That is not at all what is going on . Those judges teach us that , in spite of our incessant unfaithfulness , God will continually work to protect us and save us even when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach us over and over and over again . In fact , they do it twelve times because there are twelve judges . And even after all that saving , at the end of the book of Judges , they had become Sodomites . God does to them exactly what He did to Sodom and Gomorrah " almost completely extinguish them . The Benjaminites did exactly what the people Sodom and Gomorrah did . They had become Sodomites . So it is a terrible thing . <p> So you can see how this model does not just have power in terms of how it presents the Bible in an eschatological , Christ-centered , kingdom of God oriented way , but it also gives you the hermeneutical equipment necessary to interpret properly in each section . That is why , if I was ever fishing , I would never try to walk on water . It is just not a good time for that . That is a once-for-all thing that happened in the midst of the life of Jesus because of who Peter was and who Jesus was and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do have to be careful when you wear those T-shirts and wear those wristbands that are the WWJD ( What Would Jesus Do ? ) because , in some sense , you are to be like Jesus . You are to turn the other cheek . You are to be kind to the poor . You are to be good to your neighbor . You are to be those kind of things . <p> But in some ways you can not be like Jesus . We have talked about that . You can not die on the cross for me . You can die on the cross for yourself if you want to , but it will not do any good for me . You can not feed five thousand . You can not heal a leper . You can not cast out demons . You can not do all kinds of things that Jesus did . So , if I tell you to do what Jesus would do , all I am doing is telling you to be a failure in your life over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Now that is the gospel . The gospel is not to be like anyone . The gospel is to trust in the Person who has done it all for you and there is nothing you can do to get out of it . That is the good news and that is what helps you hermeneutically . <p> That is how we are going to conclude this lecture and I will come back in some more lectures later and we will talk about how each of the individual books function more specifically in the midst of this architecture .

I am 25 years old , profoundly deaf , legally blind and dependent on a ventilator , a feeding tube and a motorized wheelchair . Most of all , I am totally dependent on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for my physical and spiritual life . It is because of God 's amazing grace that I have joy in my life . <p> Biblical Training Institute is a great program for me because it offers exactly what I need at this time in my life ; sound biblical training on-line and at no cost . Because of my unique challenges this program ideally allows me to work at home at my own pace . My pastor , Brian Shealy , recommended it to me . The courses offered have lectures that are transcribed so I can read them on my Closed Circuit TV with help from my nurse . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a wonderful mentor , Pastor John Eichholz , who visits weekly to go over what I am studying and answer questions . I am blessed ! <p> My first class , Life is a Journey , is helping me better understand the deeper meaning of my faith . As a small boy I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior , because I did n't want to be separated from Him . I knew I was a sinner , so I repented and began to follow Jesus Christ . I was baptized in obedience to Christ having been reconciled to Him . Since then I have learned that before I was a Christian I was spiritually dead . I was in the kingdom of darkness , separated from God . Now I better understand that Baptism is an act of obedience and does not merit salvation . Instead shows that my old life is buried . I have been raised to a new life in Christ . <p> Now , I am not Tyson Snedeker ; I am a follower of Jesus Christ . The Holy Spirit drew me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My behavior has changed . I have learned through the first course how the Holy Spirit works in me . I understand more the fruits of the Spirit and how the Spirit of God gives me new desires that change my behavior . Now I have more control of my temper and anger with His help . The Holy Spirit gives me the power to turn away from sin and experience more joy and self-control . As I learn more I enjoy this new life of discipleship that much more . <p> My name is Judy Rooks , Tyson 's nurse ; we have known each other for 16 years . I accompanied Tyson and his twin brother David everyday in elementary school , ( starting with the second half of 3rd grade ) . I was with both boys through middle school , until David passed having just turned 15 years old . Tyson continued on through high school until the last 3 months of his senior year , when he experienced an exacerbation of his disease process that kept him at home more than at school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After graduation Tyson had a deep desire to continue being challenged academically , so we began doing bible studies together . He has always loved the Lord , has a deep interest in his faith and a desire to learn more , making bible studies a natural choice . He has completed several studies from Lifeway and received certificates of completion . He has completed other studies as well , with worn books and memory cards as evidence of his efforts . <p> Assisting Tyson with his studies is challenging due to Tyson 's being deaf and legally blind ( visually impaired ) . Along with his physical challenges Tyson has struggled to this day with infections and other very uncomfortable symptoms of his disease process . This slows and sometimes stops his studying for unknown periods of time . It is however important to know that whatever Tyson studies , he memorizes ; it is locked in his mind , book , chapter , verse and cross references .

To communicate , I sign and he responds with lip movements and an almost inaudible voice because of his trach . Then I sign back to him to be sure I understand him . <p> To do these studies Tyson and I use a closed circuit TV ( CCTV ) system . Printed material is passed under a camera which enlarges and projects the material to a large screen television ; which allows him to see and read his material . As he is reading I watch his face and lips to ensure I go at the right speed for him to read . We stop many times to check that he has understood what we have read , often times we may go off on a bunny trail . For example : The 23rd psalm . Tyson had minimal understanding of a shepherd 's relationship to his animals . We used this opportunity to deepen his understanding of this subject .

@@35723447 @4723447/ <h> Lesson 5 " Evaluation of Statism and Anti-Statism <p> Now I still have to ask the question , what does the Biblical worldview say about all these ? I want to say 1 more thing about this statist stuff other than the fact that statism does n't work . Why is statism evil ? No. 1 it is counterproductive . It is counterproductive . Now , I 'm not going to give you the arguments for that today . But my goodness , if you 're alert , and you 're paying attention , and you 're reading the right magazines , this stuff is counterproductive . Secondly , it is dangerous . Because what happens when too much power get centralized in the hands of a few people . Now , right now , I 'm thinking of a quotation from a famous British thinker . And I know that at least 1 person in this room can quote this . The author of this statement was a man named Lord Acton . " Power corrupts " . Now , what are anti-statists in the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the American founding fathers be interested in doing ? Decentralizing power . And how did they do that ? Through the complex form of government that we have . The purpose of the founding fathers was to give us a form of government in which bad people , and every human being is bad , and which bad people can do the least amount of harm . <p> Thirdly , why is statism evil ? It 's dangerous , it 's counterproductive , it is expensive . Perhaps the most evil dimension of statism is this . It destroys societies , and voluntary behavior . It destroys it . What is most evil about statists is that they are enemies of voluntary behavior . They are enemies of societies . When , watch this original expression , when push comes to shove , the statist will always vote for more government . He will always vote for bigger government . Take anything you want . Education . What is the conservative alternative to a statist system of education . It is to put education primarily in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator in Washington DC determine what your children are going to be forced to study . And among the things they will be forced to study when the guys get the power to do it , is that they are going to be forced to read books about Selies ? ? ? ? to mothers . And about homosexual men functioning as fathers and all of the rest . I 'm going to give you a sentence here . All politicians are sinners . All parents are sinners . But even though there are parents whose foolish behavior proves to be harmful to the education process , proves to be harmful to their own children and are too , forgive this word , are too dumb to see that . Who are you going to trust more ? With these few exceptions . Are you going to trust the government bureaucrats ? Are you going to trust the graduates of government teacher schools who had not been taught anything incidentally that they can share with , believe me , this is usually ...

What happens when statists attack societies ? What they do is they concentrate more power in the hands of the people who should n't have these decision making processes . <p> The benefits of society over the state include this . That even if you find yourself in a communal setting that is ripe for a disaster , you can always opt out . Right ? Let 's say you make a mistake and you put your children in the wrong school .

I know that if you think my argument here is inadequate , you 're going to attack me . That 's why I 'm hiding behind the lectern . I can duck . But remember this before we start talking about the New Testament , let 's remember what we learn last week about 1 Samuel chapter 8 . That 's an inspired part of God 's word . Even though it warns about the stupidity of the children of Israel who wanted a king . <p> Let me just see whether we are together on this .

We must have a lot of charismatics in here . They raise both of their hands and they were shouting " Glory ! " Let us turn to the marvelous words in this book called " Social Justice and the Christian Church " . <p> And we are going to explore the state in the New Testament . I think first Samuel 8 is a pretty pivotal passage in the Old Testament . Now allow me just to read here because I like to read my own stuff . " For the sake of completeness , a possible objection must be considered . Many sincere Christians might object to the critical stand this chapter has taken to the state on the grounds that is incompatible with the basic New Testament passage on the subject Romans chapter 13 verses 1 to 7 " . Let me read Romans chapter 13 . Here it is . " Let every person be subject to the governing authorities " . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God and those that exist had been instituted by God . Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment . For rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad . Would you have no fear of him who is in authority ? Than do what is good . And you will receive his approval . For he is God 's servant for your good . For if you do wrong , be afraid . For he does not bear the sword in vain . He is the servant of God to execute his wrath on the wrongdoer . Therefore , one must be subject not only to avoid God 's wrath but also for the sake of conscience . For the same reason you must also pay taxes . For the authorities are ministers of God attending to this very thing . Pay all of them their dues , revenue to whom revenue is due , respect to whom respect is due , honor to whom honor is due " . That 's the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentative opinion , non dogmatically , which is the way I do everything . A lot of people read Romans 13 and they say , " Now , do you know who this ruling authority was ? He was Nero " . I 'm sorry , but I just want to throw out a little dissent there . Remember ruler is not a terror to good conduct but to bad . Does that describe Nero ? Of course it does not . Let me suggest here that Paul is talking in very general terms about a theoretical good ruler . He is not describing Nero . I can not believe that he is . We 're talking about what a ruler ought to be , not what we in fact have right now in the city of Rome . Let me make some additional comments . Problems result if this passage is taken as an endorsement of statism . Or as the exclusive and final New Testament teaching about the state . The passage clearly teaches that the state plays an important role in providing for social order . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have already said that . There is a place in God 's program for government . The question becomes how much government ? Anarchism is ruled out but where are we suppose to end up ? Now , let 's keep breathing here . But the previous argument has already acknowledged that point , several times . I am not an anarchists . Remember the quotes I gave you about the founding fathers- John Adams and James Monroe . If men were angels , no government would be necessary . But men are not angels , and so on . A Christian anarchist interested in reconciling his views with the New Testament would have some major difficulty with this text . But anarchism has already been disqualified as a viable political theory . Looking back , I should have kicked anarchism around a little bit more , and if you want me to someday I will . Although kicking anything around is contrary to my nature . <p> Since nothing in the text entails the kind of statism criticized earlier in this chapter , no obvious conflict between Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . You ca n't pull statism out of Romans 13 . You ca n't pull anarchism out of Romans 13 . Now , students of the New Testament have often pointed out the dangers of taking Romans 13 out of context . This is a good point and I get it from a pretty good scholar . I 'll mention his name shortly . When Paul 's comments about the state are read in their full context , which begins at Romans 12:1 , they appear in a new light . Paul raises the question of the state for one very specific reason . In the preceding verses he had warned the Christians not take vengeance on people who wronged him . The letter Paul wrote " Never avenge yourselves but leave it to the wrath of God for it written " Vengeance is mine , I will repay " , says the LORD . But , that 's the end of the quote . But , if it is wrong for the Christian to pay back evil with evil of his own , it is only natural for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does the very thing he is urged to avoid , namely taking vengeance on wrongdoers . You see , put the text in its context and you then understand why this is being discussed . In other words , the subject of the state is raised because of the apparent conflict between the Christian 's personal obligations to refrain from vengeance , and the Christian 's apparent need to cooperate in the state 's exercise of punishment . Paul is teaching Christians that what holds for one case does not apply in the other . Because human beings are wicked . There must be an institution on earth to restrain that wickedness , and that institution is the state . The only way in which the state can fulfill its God given task in maintaining social order is to threaten potential wrongdoers and then carry out those threats in acts of punishment . In short , Christians must abstain from acts of vengeance in their personal lives but in the case of the state , coercion and punishment are necessary . Therefore in spite of the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , Christians are still to submit themselves to the state . They are not to oppose the state just because it engages in some activities forbidden to the believer . The 2 cases are totally different and call for different standards . I think that 's pretty good stuff , and I can say that because I borrow it from somebody , maybe Oscar Kumon ? ? ? Turn the page . I do n't know whether was Kumon ? ? ? on the previous page or not . You can check it out on his book . <p> Now page 24 . Many appeal to Romans 13 also ignore other New Testament passages that clearly set forth limits to the state authority . Limits ! No limit , too few limits , limits . That 's moderate statism . OK . For example , early in the history of the Jerusalem church , representative of the state forbade the apostles to teach , the reply of Peter and the apostles that they should obey God rather than men . Acts chapter 5 was a clear recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another limitation in 1 Corinthians 6 : 1 when he urged Christians to settle their disagreements outside of the courts of the state . And especially significant text is Revelations 13 where the writer uses the imagery of the 7 headed beast rising out of the sea as a scarcely disguised illusion to the Roman state . Here the state is pictured as the totalitarianism instrument by which Satan persecutes the righteous believer propagandizes his lies and slaughters the innocent . According to Oscar Kumon ? ? nothing in the New Testament supports the conclusion that the state is divine . Since the state stands in an order which is still willed by God it possess a certain dignity that Christian should respect . As long as states stand in God 's order , it is proper to be subject to them to the extent they stay within their limits . Hey , that 's moderate anti-statism . For to the extent that they are God 's servants and have indeed some judgment over good and evil . Only when they try to free themselves from the subjection which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they demand what belongs to God . Nothing there in the New Testament precludes , justify criticisms of the state in the insistence of proper limits to the state 's power . I can say Amen to that . I wish I 've written that . I guess I did . So , I believe , ladies and gentlemen , all of you that the theory of the state that we have discussed over 2 weeks is consistent with not only the explicit statements in the explicit teachings of Scripture but it is consistent with the Biblical worldview . Amen .

@@35723471 @4723471/ <h> Order of the OT Books <h> The Hebrew Order Teaches Covenant <h> I. Review <p> In our previous time together yesterday , we spent a good deal of time just talking in general about what the New Testament says about the meaning and significance of the Old Testament and what is it about . We were able to describe the significance or the meaning of the Old Testament with both an encompassing framework and a theological center . We had two things we focused on yesterday . We talked about Jesus Christ being the theological center of the Old Testament , that is , the person it is about . The Old Testament is about Jesus . We were also able to talk about and use the phrase the kingdom of God as our thematic framework . That is the thing we think about when we want to summarize all of the diverse parts into a unified whole . We do that with the phrase the kingdom of God . The kingdom of God is that overarching umbrella that helps us to understand the whole of Scripture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center , that helps us to understand the center or the point of Scripture . <p> Now we did that by going to Scripture itself . We looked at Acts 28:23 , where Luke is summarizing basically Paul 's teaching ministry in Rome . He uses these descriptions : Jesus and the kingdom of God . He also , remember , uses those similar descriptions in the very beginning of Acts . In Acts 1 , the kingdom of God is mentioned there and also Jesus . In some sense , it kind of brackets what is going on there for Luke . Luke is our master summary statement-maker . He is always summarizing , in some sense , what Paul is doing . Those are great statements about what Paul is doing with his Bible . And for Paul , remember , his Bible was the Old Testament ; not the Old Testament and our current New Testament . That was still , you could say , in production . It was at the publishing house , but not yet released . They were still anticipating its release . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three parts : the kingdom of God , Jesus and then the law and the prophets . We had these two questions " the million dollar questions or the two million dollar questions . What is the Bible about ? How is that message communicated ? We tackled those questions . Look on your summary sheet for Covenant Part I Review . I just put that there in your handout . We said this is the big question : What is the Bible about ? And how is that message communicated ? We answered that question with Acts 28:23 . Let 's just read it again by way of introduction to today 's course . It says , it is written , in Acts 28:23 , " When they had set a day for Paul , they came to him at his lodging in large numbers and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets . " And so , from Acts 28:23 I get my three-dimensional worldview into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thematic framework . Jesus is my theological center . Then we have the Law of Moses and the Prophets as our canonical structure . That is what we are going to be working on today . It is this statement : a canonical structure . <p> If you are tracking with the metaphors that we used yesterday , we used two metaphors . We used both the metaphor of the body and the metaphor of a tire or a wheel . In terms of a tire or a wheel , Jesus is the hub of the tire . The kingdom of God is that outer part , the wheel or the rim which rolls on the ground . And then the thematic structure is those spokes that give it the form and the structure and the stability " and that is the Law and the Prophets . <p> In terms of the metaphor of a body , the kingdom of God is the skin . It is that organ of the body which contains everything . Nothing exists outside of the skin . Then we had also the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You take the heart out of the body and it is a lifeless , dead piece of tissue . You have got to have the heart . And then the canonical structure , the Law and the Prophets represents , in the body metaphor , the bones . It is that which gives it its form and outward appearance and basic structure . That is what we are going to be looking at today and tomorrow , for these next few hours of lecture . <h> II . The Structure of Jesus ' Bible <p> We need to expand upon the designation that Luke records in Acts 28 . In Acts 28 we get a simpler reference to Jesus ' Old Testament : the Law of Moses and the Prophets . This occurs a number of times throughout the New Testament as a reference to the Bible of the New Testament community . <h> a . Luke 24 <p> But in another place , by Luke again , in Luke 24:44-45 , we get another reference by Jesus concerning His Bible . Let 's read that in Luke 24:44-45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I told you while I was still with you . Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses , the Prophets and Psalms . ' Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures . " <p> Here it is not just the Law of Moses and the Prophets . We now have three categories for Jesus ' description of the Old Testament . The first one is the Law or the Law of Moses . The second category is the prophets . And then He mentions the Psalms . So we have the Law , the Prophets and the Psalms . What is this a reference to ? Why would Jesus refer to His Bible in these three categories ? The answer to that question is this . In my Hebrew Bible , my printed Hebrew Bible , my Bible printed in Hebrew ( or , for example , in the Jewish Publication Society Bible , the Bible of the Jewish community today ) , the Old Testament is divided , not into four sections like our English Bibles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's modern Jewish Bible has three sections . They are called the Law , the Prophets and the Writings . <p> You will often hear this referred to in popular circles as the Tanakh . Tanakh is simply an acronym for the names of the three sections . In Hebrew , the word for law is Torah . It starts with a " T " . The word for prophets in Hebrew is Nevi'im . That starts with an " N " sound . We will just put " N " in English . Finally the writings begin with the " K " sound or a hard " C " sound . In Hebrew they are the Ketuvim . So you have this T , N and K , and then they just simply stick the simple " A " vowels between the consonants and you get Tanakh . Those are the three divisions : the Law , the Prophets and the Writings . <p> In Jesus ' designation , He simply refers to the last book as Psalms . Why does He do this and not just call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was called this . Let me just summarize certain things for you . First , the writings would have been the last bunch of Biblical books in the Old Testament canonized . The material in the Law is the oldest . The material in the Prophets is the next oldest . And then the stuff in the Writings was canonized last . And so we have these three sections . In the Jewish Bible or in my Hebrew Bible , the book of Psalms is the first book in this section . One of the ways ancient literature named its sections was oftentimes just by the first word or the first piece in that literature . Let me give you an example . The book of Genesis in Hebrew is called Bereshit simply because that is the first word in the book . The book of Exodus is called Shemot " names . Or it is called Eli Shemot . That is just the first words . The book of Leviticus is called Vayikra " and He called . That is not very descriptive in terms of content or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book . <p> It is a standard ancient practice . One of the reasons this third section is listed that way is just because this is the first book in that section . There are twelve books in this section . We will talk about that in a moment . But the book of Psalms is the first . So it is an easy way of calling it that . That is what is going on there . <p> Now this is different to what you are normally used to seeing in the Old Testament . In our Old Testaments in our English Bibles , we do not see three sections : Law , Prophets and Writings . We see four sections . We see the Law , or what is called the Pentateuch , which means five books . Those are the first five books of Moses . Then we have a large list of historical books . Then we have a few poets . And then we have all of our prophets . So in our English Bibles we have four sections . In our Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to compare and contrast the Hebrew Bible arrangement and the English Bible arrangement . Then we are going to have to think which one should we adopt in terms of our own thinking . Is the arrangement important or is it not ? We are going to have to talk about that : a three-fold structure or a four-fold structure . <p> If any of you have ever written a book or have ever written even a paper , you will know that the arrangement of that paper or book is important . You do not start with your conclusions , then followed by the summary , then followed by the introduction and then the body . The arrangement is important and the arrangement tells you about the nature of the paper . Different papers have different arrangements . Likewise , different books have different arrangements . The arrangement is important . <p> We are going to talk about the possible arrangement of the Hebrew Bible , the Old Testament . From the New Testament , from Luke 24 , we learn one thing about the arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sections and not four . In a moment , we will talk about other historical evidence that supports that . That even predates Jesus . We will talk about some stuff after Jesus . Then we will talk about how we got four sections versus three sections . It is important to know . Because if you drop this bomb on somebody and say your Bible is out of order , you have got to be able to explain that . Before you have what I call a canon revolution and start chopping up your Bible and rearranging it , you have to be able to articulate how it got that way and why you think it should go back . Or you may disagree with me . That is fine too . I am simply going to set forth for you some different options and then argue for one of them . <h> b . Luke 11 <p> Additional New Testament evidence that is helpful to have at your disposal in terms of thinking about the structure and the order of the Bible in Jesus ' day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew 23:33-35 . This is the synoptic account . It is the same account in both Luke and Matthew . They are parallel accounts . So I will just read the Luke 11 one . But note also that it is in Matthew 23:33-35 . Here is the Luke 11:49-51 passage read . The Bible says : " The wisdom of God said , ' I will send them prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and persecute ' , so that the blood of the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against this generation , from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it will be required of this generation . " <p> This is a very odd kind of statement . You are going to thin : How in the world are you talking about the Bible 's order based upon that verse ? That just seems impossible to me . But it is actually quite descriptive and very commonly understood to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abel and Zechariah , it may look like we have an A to Z arrangement : all of the prophets from A to Z. That would mean every prophet . In Hebrew , that does not work because Abel starts with what is equivalent to our " H " and Zechariah starts with a " Z " and that is the seventh letter in the Hebrew alphabet . We have Aleph , Beth , Gimel , Daleth , He , Waw and Zayin ( or Alef , Bet , Gimel , Dalet , He , Vav and Zayin in Unicode ) : those are the fifth and seventh letters in the Hebrew alphabet . So the A to Z scenario does not work in Hebrew because that is letters five to seven . <p> What is going on here in Jesus ' mind when He is making reference to Abel and Zechariah ? Well , it is this . He is talking about canonically ( that is , in His Bible ) the first recorded martyr in Genesis 4 and the last recorded martyr at the end of 2 Chronicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these two martyrs is not a reference from A to Z , Abel to Zechariah . Let us get that clear . Rather it is a reference to the first and last recorded martyrs in the Hebrew Bible : Abel in Genesis 4 and Zechariah in 2 Chronicles . Now what Jesus is doing there is He is making a reference to His entire Bible . All of the martyrs in My Bible , their blood will be required of this generation . So not only do we know from Jesus ' very own mouth that His Bible has three sections , we can also tell what was the first book in His Bible ( Genesis ) and what was the last book in His Bible ( Chronicles ) . That is different from our Bible , because the last book in our English Old Testament is Malachi . We are going to have to take a look at that in a moment and say : Well , which one is it ? Is it Malachi or Chronicles ? And does it matter ? So there are some interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places in antiquity or history that make reference to either a three-fold or a four-fold Old Testament ? Where are they dated , before Jesus or after Jesus ? And does that help us understand ? Let me just give you a few things , because this is the kind of information that can be disconcerting to the person in the pew . When you tell them that their beloved Old Testament that they memorized with rigor in Sunday School and got the gold star on the Sunday School chart is actually not the original order and perhaps not the best order to be working with , you will need to account for that . <h> c . Ecclesiasticus <p> Is there anything else in history ? Well , we do have some stuff in history . We have a book in the Apocrypha . The Apocrypha is a collection of books that were considered of value to the ancients , but not necessarily part of the canon . They were not inspired , authoritative and inerrant . They are in Catholic Bibles , but not in Protestant Bibles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibles will have them . They are called the Apocrypha . One of those books , called The Wisdom of Sirach or Ecclesiasticus was written in the second century B.C. <p> That book was translated by the author 's grandson in approximately 132BC . It was translated from Hebrew into Greek . The Hebrew Old Testament Scriptures also were being translated from Hebrew into Greek around this time . We now call that translation the Septuagint . Greek was becoming the prevailing language during that day and so , in some sense , they were making their first NIV modern Bible translation for that people group . <p> When the grandson of the author of Ecclesiasticus wrote his translation or did his translation work , he wrote a preface to it . Three times in the preface , over one hundred and thirty years prior to Jesus ' birth , he makes reference to the Old Testament as the law , the prophets and the other books . He refers to the law , the prophets and the last or the final writings . Three times he makes a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as the second century B.C. According to the testimony of the author there himself , it is already an ancient tradition . At that time , he already has a three-fold Bible , not a four-fold Bible " talking about the Old Testament . The Old Testament of the translator to Ecclesiasticus three sections and not four . That is very important . This is well over a hundred years before Jesus is even born . So this version of three-fold division of the Old Testament is quite old . It predates Jesus . <h> d . The Babylonian Talmud <p> Several centuries after Jesus , we have the Babylonian Talmud . This was the Jewish interpretation of the law while they were living , in some sense , in exile in Babylon . This was many , many years after the original exile . They were very specific about their Bibles and the laws and the rules and everything that went with living and thinking about their Old Testaments . In one of the tractates of the Babylonian Talmud , called Bava Barta or Baba Bathra ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14b , if you want the reference . It represents the oldest rabbinical order dating from the third to the sixth centuries A.D. <p> It actually lists all of the books of the Old Testament and it puts them in a specific order and it gives a rational for the ordering . That list has a three-fold division . When we compare it to our Hebrew Bibles , there are only two main differences . We will perhaps talk about those , but at least I will list them now for you . In the Babylonian Talmud listing , Isaiah is not the first of the Major Prophets . In our Bibles , it is Isaiah , Jeremiah and Ezekiel . In the Babylonian Talmud it is Jeremiah , Ezekiel and Isaiah . We can talk about that . Perhaps when we get to the prophets and I am talking about the prophets , I will tell you why I think Isaiah should be first and Ezekiel should be last . But it is not a critical point for our discussion . <p> And the other one is the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place . But let us just say the book of Ruth is in an alternate location in the Babylonian Talmud list as opposed to both our English Bibles and in our current Hebrew Bible arrangement . This is very interesting . I will talk about that . Ruth is one of my favorite paradigm examples for why the location of a book in the Bible is important . In the English Bible , you probably well know that it is Joshua , Judges and Ruth . Ruth comes after Judges , because historically it is located during that time . In terms of genre , it is historical narrative and so it fits well there . In my Hebrew Bible , the book of Ruth comes after Proverbs . We will talk about why that is the case later . In the Babylonian Talmud list , the book of Ruth is the first book in the book of the Writings . It is the preface , in some sense , to the book of Psalms . The reason for that is , you will recall , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . One of the primary authors and collectors for the book of Psalms is David . In some sense it is like the brief author biography for a book . Have you ever seen in a book , on the dustcover or on the back flap , the picture of the author and his name and then where he is from and who he is ? Have you seen that kind of thing ? It would be something like that . It would be like the dustcover . But that ( Ruth ) is a lot of narrative just to identify a dude . So we have got to figure out : Is it just for that or is there something else going on ? We will talk about those three options . <h> e . The Problem of Canonical Structure <p> By way of brief summary , the canonical structure that we are about to describe represents the presentation and the representation , the arrangement of the Old Testament Scriptures . The thematic framework represents the encompassing matrix or theological sum under which all of the various parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center represents the goal , reason and ultimate explanation for the presence of every article , adverb , preposition and conjunction contained in this living word . We have got these three things . We have got our thematic frame , theological center and now we have got a canonical structure . <p> But here is our problem . We have at least two canonical structures . I will be honest with you . The whole discussion of canon and the history of canonization is very difficult to get at in all of its specific details . What I am going to be doing is simply looking at two final forms of the canon : the Hebrew Bible canon and the English Bible canon of the Old Testament . I am going to try to do this . I am going to say the Hebrew Bible canon , or the Hebrew arrangement of the Old Testament is governed by these criteria . I am going to say the English Bible arrangement of the Old Testament is governed by these criteria . Can we explain which one is original and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , if one is original and one is derived , which one should we be following in terms of how we think about the Bible ? I hope that is clear . <h> III . My Bible is Out of Order <p> This next part of the lecture , I have given this subtitle to . This is a new section . What we have done is the introduction to all of this . Now , this part of the lecture is going to be dealing specifically with the arrangement of the Old Testament , English versus Hebrew . I have labeled this section " Order in the court , my Bible is out of order " . My English Bible is out of order . In some sense , for me , it is being charged with contempt . My Bible is out of order . Before we look at the structure of the Christian Bible , we must first consider which version or arrangement of the Old Testament is to be used for our discussion . We have already alluded to this reality . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important observations about the differences between the Hebrew and the English Bible arrangements . We must also justify our use of one over the other in our discussion of the Bible in its final form . <p> Let me preface what I am about to say this way . You may , at the end of these lectures , adopt to follow in your mind a different arrangement of the Old Testament than is currently available to you in your English Bible . Fine and dandy . Or you may just opt to say " I am going to just keep my English Bible order . What you have said really does not convince me or make much sense . " That is fine too . If you do adopt the alternate structure , that does not necessarily mean you have got to rearrange your Bible in English , although that is not a bad idea . It would not be irreligious . But what you have to do , as you are just thinking about it differently , and when you teach or preach from it , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are at . So you can use the English Bible and the English Bible arrangement in church . <p> You do not have to upset the apple cart . There are certain people " for example , your favorite sweet grandmother sitting in the pew " who , the moment you tell them that Ruth is out of place , that would dislodge them in a significant way . You would want to be careful and sensitive to how you do that . In this more academic environment , we can be a little more provocative and say things in a little more shocking manner to make the point . But you can not do that in the local church . So please be sensitive . <p> There are things we will learn here that you must ease them into your congregation 's life and mind . Then you have got to be committed to being there to iron out all the kinks . You just can not show up on Sunday , drop the bomb and burn rubber out of the parking lot . You have got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And perhaps , for some of you who are in youth ministry , you know there are some things you have got to say and do in the life of the youth that , if you are just a transient bystander , it is really of no value . You have got to be the kind of person to be around for a while to let it stick in or sink in and work itself out . <h> a . The Scholarly Literature <p> Let us talk , then , about the significance of order and meaning . One of the things that is happening in contemporary Old Testament scholarly literature is this . People are beginning to revert to a Hebrew Bible arrangement in their discussion of Old Testament theology . Let me give you two good examples . I can give you three off the top of my head . <p> First , Paul House has just come out with a big , massive volume called Old Testament Theology . I can give you four examples , by the way , now . He structures his Biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order because he believes that that order , that that structure , provides meaning and significance to the whole . So he can better understand the individual parts by understanding where they fit in the whole . I will demonstrate that to you later by showing you what that does with something like the book of Ruth . Ruth is a very small and simple , but profound , example . <p> John Sailhamer is a scholar at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary . I think it is in North Carolina . He has some stuff out on introduction to the Old Testament or introduction to Biblical Theology or Old Testament Theology . He discusses this arrangement and what he calls the intentional putting together of the canon . He calls it the macro-canonical structure . He is saying that the final form of the canon , the big picture , helps us understand all the different little pictures that make it up . You can get Paul House 's book or John Sailhamer 's book and they will be discussing Old Testament theology in these categories . <p> Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you want more references later for further study . Steve Dempster has a Biblical theological study of the Old Testament called Dominion and Dynasty . It is in the Inter-Varsity Press Biblical Theology Series . He adheres to closely and argues vehemently for using the Babylonian Talmud list . That is our Hebrew Bible with Isaiah and Ruth in different locations . His whole theology , the matrix through which he looks at Scripture , is dependent upon and stems from the arrangement of the canon that way . There are people doing this and actually doing fruitful theological work . <p> Another one is Rolf Rendtorff . He is a German scholar and he has a massive volume . I do not remember what it is called . It is something like A Canonical Theology of the Hebrew Bible . I know it is by Deo Publishing . editor 's note : The Canonical Hebrew Bible : a Theology of the Old Testament It is a massive piece of literature . At the very beginning and at the very end , he argues that we must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament , with the Hebrew Bible arrangement . <p> My job is going to be , with these gentlemen , to convince you why that is true . <h> b . A Comparison of the English and Hebrew Bible Arrangements <p> Let us take a look at our handout of the Old Testament canon . I have a handout for you entitled : " The Old Testament Canon : A Comparison of the English and the Hebrew Bible Arrangements " . It has two big columns on it . Do you guys have that ? There is an English Bible column and a Hebrew Bible column . <p> The English Bible column is on the left . The Hebrew Bible column is on the right . Here is what we have . The English Bible column you are going to recognize from growing up in Sunday school . You see it when you turn to the table of contents in any English Bible . There is the Pentateuch , five books there : Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers and Deuteronomy . Then you have a number of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are poetical . Then you have all of the prophets or what the English Bible considers prophets. <h> c . The Arrangement of the Hebrew Bible <p> In the Hebrew Bible , you do not have four divisions . You have three . Those are in bold on the handout : the Law , the Prophets and the Writings . In the Law , you have same five books that are in the English Pentateuch . That is like the holy of holies of the Old Testament . No one messes with i . It is Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers and Deuteronomy . Then , in the Prophets , you have two groups of prophets : the former prophets and the latter prophets . There are four former prophets : Joshua , Judges , Samuel and Kings . <p> In the Hebrew Bible , 1 and 2 Samuel is one book . 1 and 2 Kings is one book . In our English Bibles , because of the Septuagint and the issue of scroll length in translation , these are each two books . The Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was translated into Greek it took a lot more words to translate , and so it became two scrolls : 1 and 2 Samuel . The divisions in the books of 1 and 2 Samuel are quite arbitrary . They are just basically based upon length , not necessarily on common sense . <p> A good example is 1 and 2 Kings . At the end of 1 Kings , from 1 Kings 17 on , that is where the story of Elijah begins But Elijah is not taken up in the fiery chariot until 2 Kings 2 . That is when Elisha 's narrative ends . That would have been the natural place to break . 2 Kings 3 is the beginning of the ministry of Elisha ( or two and a half ) . That is where you should have 2 Kings start . But it just does not work that way . It is not intended to be a logical break . It is intended to be just a natural scroll length break . So there is no significance in the break , except for convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one book . <p> You have the Former Prophets : Joshua , Judges , Samuel , Kings . Then you have the Latter Prophets : Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel and , here is my favorite designation , the Twelve . These were always the hardest books for me to memorize in Sunday School . There is Hosea and Joel and Amos and Obadiah and then the rest of them get really fuzzy . I know Malachi is at the end and they have got Zechariah and Haggai and Habakkuk and all that stuff in there . But in the Hebrew Bible , they were easier on their children in Sunday School . They just had Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel and the Twelve . In the Hebrew Old Testament , the twelve Minor Prophets are considered one book . This makes sense because , in some major fashion of measurable reality , the message of each of the twelve Minor Prophets is not complete without the other . We will talk about that when we get to the Minor Prophets and speak briefly about their structure and their existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then you get to the Writings . The Writings are twelve books . They begin with Psalms and they end with Chronicles . Again , we have 1 and 2 Chronicles in our English Bible , but for the Hebrew Bible it is just Chronicles . We have Psalms , Job , Proverbs , Ruth , Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes . There is the first six . Then we have the second six : Lamentations , Esther , Daniel , Ezra , Nehemiah and Chronicles . <p> I am going to come back and explain this to you . Do you know there is actually a rationale for this arrangement ? There is actually a rationale for what is in the former prophets and what is in the latter prophets . There is actually a rationale for the arrangement of the twelve books and the Writings and for the two sub-groups , the first six and the latter six . If you understand those arrangements and rationales for the grouping and the sub-groupings , that is going to help you interpret the books . Their position is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have studied Greek ( a lot of you are studying Greek in here ) , you will notice that we have talked about the issue of word order in Greek versus word order in English . Word order in Greek means very little because it is a case-driven system . You could have the direct object of your verb out front or at the end . You can have the noun that is the subject in the beginning or at the end . It does not matter . But in English , position is everything , because it tells you about the function . If you like to think in those terms , for example " In English , the noun that is before the verb is the subject and the noun that is after the verb is probably the object . The position of the noun in relation to the verb tells you its function . <p> A similar reality exists in the Hebrew Bible . The position of the book in the canon in some way is related to its function . So it is important to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you took an English sentence and you put all the nouns up front without any regard for their function in the clause and you just put noun , noun , noun and verb , you would have a tough time knowing how those nouns really functioned in the life of the sentence . If you do the same thing in the Hebrew Bible " if you take all certain books and just put them together according to another arrangement scheme " you are going to have a hard time telling how those books originally functioned in the life of the canon . But that is exactly what we have done in our English Bible . We have misplaced books . We have rearranged it . Now we do not really understand its original function . So we have problems in interpretation because we have lost their original position . Position in Hebrew and in the Hebrew Bible equals , to a large degree , function and meaning . We are going to get to that . <h> d . The Arrangement of the English Bible <p> So what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look at the handout in front of you entitled : " The Old Testament Canon " . There are only going to be about four handouts in this class , so it is not going to be overwhelming . There are four sections and there are three criteria . This is important . There are three criteria that govern the arrangement of the English Bible . You may have never even thought about this . This may be completely new material to you to even think that . I do not know , growing up , that I ever thought : " Why is my Bible arranged that way ? " . This may be a completely new way of thinking about your Bible . <p> The English Bible has four sections and we have got three criteria for that arrangement . What is the word I used ? Three principles that govern the arrangement of the English Bible . The first is genre . The second is chronology . The third is authorship . The three principles that govern the arrangement of our four-fold English Bible are genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre ? Genre is simply this : the type of literature . Is it history or narrative , poetry , prophecy ? This criterion shapes the Old Testament at the macro-canonical level . That is a big word . This is the kind of word you can now impress your friends with . I was thinking this afternoon about the macro-canonical structure of my Bible and it dawned on me . You begin a sentence like that and you have just entered into a new sphere of relationship with your peers . This criterion shapes the Old Testament at the macro-canonical level . That is to say , the four major divisions " Pentateuch , Historical Books , Poetical Books and Prophetical Books " are structured by genre . That is , the books that appear in those four main sections are determined primarily by genre . <p> Look at your list now . In the Pentateuch , we are going to leave that out for a moment , because the Pentateuch is unique and it is frozen . It is the Mosaic literature and , like I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next section is a gathering of all of the historical books following the Pentateuch . So you have Joshua , Judges , Ruth , 1 and 2 Samuel , 1 and 2 Kings , 1 and 2 Chronicles , Ezra , Nehemiah and Esther . Every book that is of historical value , is written in a historical narrative . is grouped there . They happen to be in chronological order , by and large . That is our genre : historical narrative . <p> Our next genre , or type of literature , is the poetry : the romantic , the deep , the esoteric . All of that business is contained in Job , Psalms , Proverbs , Ecclesiastes , Song of Songs . <p> Then you have the Prophets : the mean and cranky guys in the Old Testament . They have doom and gloom and all of that business " not really , but that is oftentimes how we think of them . You have Isaiah , Jeremiah , then you have Lamentations , Ezekiel , Daniel and The Twelve . You have these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macro-canonical structure , the main divisions . Does that help ? <p> The second two criteria , chronology and authorship , work at the micro-canonical level . That is , they determine the arraignment of books within those sections . So , for example , in chronology : the events of Joshua happen to predate the events of the Judges . Then , we know that the book of Ruth exists after the book of Judges because , at the very beginning of the book Ruth , it says : " These things happened during the days of the Judges . " So let us just slap it in there because it meets two things . It is the same genre and the same chronology " even though we do not know who wrote the book of Ruth . Then the events of 1 and 2 Samuel generally come before 1 and 2 Kings . And then 1 and 2 Chronicles contains events that happened after 1 and 2 Kings " although , if you have read Chronicles , you will know that in the genealogies it starts with Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the deutero-history of the Old Testament . Deuteronomy is the " second law " . Chronicles is the deutero-history , the " second " history of Israel . It is a different history for a different purpose . But it recounts everything from Adam up to about 400BC , by and large . Then you have Ezra , Nehemiah and Esther . Those things really happened after the events recorded in Chronicles . At the micro-canonical level , in that section , chronology is really at work in shaping those books . That makes good sense to our Western minds . We do not want 1 Kings heading up the Former Prophets or heading up the Historical Books , because the things in 1 Kings did not happen until way after the things in Joshu . For us , we think linearly and we like to have things in order . That is how we like our blocks organized . <p> Then look in the Poetry . Here you can see , in some sense , there is some chronology going on . We think that Job is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists there . Psalms has some older material in it , so it goes second . And then Proverbs , Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs we would attribute , by and large , to Solomon . We think of David as the primary working force behinds Psalms and that kind of stuff . So , we can think it is basically historical in terms of its arrangement , by date of composition . <p> Then in the Prophets , Isaiah preceded Jeremiah . Jeremiah preceded Ezekiel and stuff like that . Ezekiel proceeded Daniel , or was in some sense contemporaneous with him . Daniel 's kind of stuff goes a little longer . Ezekiel and Daniel are contemporaries at some point . Then the twelve Minor Prophets span the gamut . Some of them are really early . Some of them are really late . It is just a conglomeration of those books . <p> But notice , in the Prophets , we have Isaiah and Jeremiah and then Lamentations . Now why would we put Lamentations after Jeremiah in our English Bible ? Because Jeremiah is the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another example of that is grouping Proverbs , Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs together . They are all by the same author " or , at least , attributed to Solomon , or a working force in them attributed to Solomon ( that wise dude of the Old Testament ) . So they are all together there . Does that make sense ? <p> Then Daniel is kind of conceived of in the Prophets . They do not really know what to do with Daniel . Some Old Testament scholars are very befuddled by what to do with Daniel . You know the famous mantra : " dare to be a Daniel " ? But very few people know what to do with him once they dare to be him . <p> David Noel Freedman has an article discussing the arrangement of the Old Testament . He has done a remarkable thing . He has counted all the words in the book . If you take the Old Testament , the Hebrew Bible , divide it in half , the arrangement is equal . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 3,000 words . Then from Isaiah to Chronicles , it is 3010 words . It is remarkably balanced . He says there is no way you could get at that unless someone was behind the design of the final form . <p> Some people may argue that there was this redactor ( which is a big fancy word for an editor ) who put it all together . And that is true . We did have to have someone put it together . Or , you could , in some sense , say that it is of divine design . In fact , because of our view of inspiration and authority and the origin of Scripture , God could have intended this from the beginning and that is how He had it work out . Either way is fine with me , because at the end you get the same thing . Whether you have a redactor doing it under inspiration or God Himself doing it kind of anecdotally through various parts coming together at the end , it still works out . I am still fine with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronology and authorship . Again , genre is the big picture , the macro-canonical divisions . Chronology and authorship are the micro-canonical divisions : that is , how each of the big divisions are grouped inside . I think that is an important thing to know . It is important to know how your English Bible is arranged . <p> Let me say : This is highly Western . That is how we think . It is very Greek . We like things grouped like this . The Greeks had their different kinds of literature . They had their histories and their tragedies . They had their prophets , their poets , all that kind of stuff . That is how they grouped their literature , if you have ever studied the classics . We also like our chronology linear . We like things in order . We want David told before Solomon and Solomon told before Rehoboam , because that is how it happened historically . It makes us feel good . We have got a grip on history . And then we like to know who wrote it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side of the shelf and our J.R.R.Tolkien books on the right side of the shelf . We do not want them mixed up . We want to keep those books written by the same author together . That is the English Bible . Any questions about the English Bible ? <p> That is what we are used to . I am just giving you a reason and rationale . If you are just simply to describe your English Bible now to folks , you can say this is how it is ordered and this is helpful to know . This is a helpful thing to know . It helps you to understand your Bible . <h> e . The Arrangement of the New Testament <p> What is interesting at this point is to say : This is not how your New Testament is arranged at all . Think of this . Why is John , 1 , 2 and 3 John and the Apocalypse not grouped together if authorship is a big thing ? That is an interesting question . Why is Luke separated from Acts ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be them . If I were putting the New Testament together " thank the Lord I do not have that responsibility " but if I were working on the final form of the New Testament , I would have gone , without a doubt , because of my Western training : Matthew , Mark , John , Luke , Acts . I would have done that without even a hesitation of a heartbeat . Why is it not that way ? There is a different arrangement scheme in the New Testament . Guess what ? It is not the same arrangement scheme as the English Bible , but it is the same arrangement scheme as the Hebrew Bible . <p> Check this out . If I can demonstrate and tell you this is why our Hebrew Bible is the way it is and if I can explain to you historically that it is original and if I can also explain to you that the New Testament is structured on it and that once you understand the Old Testament structure the New Testament structure is parallel to it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew Bible order along with the New Testament ? We do not have to change our New Testament order at all . We could a little bit . <p> Let me conclude with this by saying this about our New Testament and then we will take a break and come back and do our second lecture . Let me preface this by saying : The history of the canon is a very complicated history . I do not at all want to come across as being an expert on canonization . I probably only know this much more than most of you , which is very , very little . If you were to go read two books on the canon , you would probably be up to speed with me . I am not at all an expert . I have read maybe half a dozen books on canon . That is not much . So I am not going to give you the full canonical history " the development and all this stuff . <p> But there is evidence from second century manuscripts ( and I will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what it is ) that says , by and large , our New Testament circulated in a grouping of four . There were the Gospels . There were the Acts and the General Epistles . There were the Pauline epistles with Hebrews sandwiched in the middle of the letters to the churches versus the letters to the individuals ( which means the second century manuscript evidence would argue for Pauline authorship of Hebrews ) . Whether you agree with that or not does not matter to me . It is anonymous and so I am happy to leave it anonymous ( although if anyone in the New Testament could have written it , Paul is a good candidate ) . Then there is the Apocalypse . So we have those four groups . That actually matches pretty well with our Old Testament arrangement . <p> And you are saying : " Four ? " . I will explain that to you in a second . There are really three main sections . There is the Gospels . There is Acts and the General Epistles . There are the Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion is kind of its own separate mama . It corresponds to something in the Old Testament that is an introduction to everything , the book of Genesis . So for me Genesis and Revelation kind of hang out at the end and correspond to each other . We will talk about that when we get to our world-famous fancy chart . <p> But here is the thing . With the New Testament really , all I am switching is two main things . We do not have to switch to the New Treatment , because nothing really happens for me at this point ( although it is interesting ) . This makes good sense to me . In the book of Acts , you get the description of the life of all of the apostles who are the general apostles : Peter , James , John . Those were all of the guys that come first . In the second half of the book of Acts , who do you get mostly ? Paul . If you take the book of Acts , then you follow it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just kept the same order in the second century manuscript tradition . You have at the beginning of the book of Acts Peter , James and John and then you get Peter , James and John 's letters . Then , at the second part of the book of Acts , you get Paul and then the second part of the Epistles is Paul . So it just corresponds one to one . Actually , you have Peter , James and John and then Paul . Then when you get their letters you get Peter , James and John and then Paul . So you kind of have this A-B-A-B pattern . If you like that , that is fine . <p> It does not do anything with my scenario because , for me , all of the epistles are jammed together in one group . How do you live and think in light of what Christ has done in the gospels ? If you switch this ( the second century order ) around , the only thing that is switching big time is you are switching the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you have kind of got an A-B-B-A . That is chiasm and it is good Hebrew and so everyone is happy on both accounts . But there is no major restructuring . There is no Pauline letter in the Gospels . There is no Gospels in the Letters " that kind of thing . Acts does not circulate with the Apocalypse . There is no change in the macro-canonical structure , simply a micro-canonical structure change . <h> IV . Conclusion <p> I can say that , at the end , when I am working with the Old Testament and the New Testament , there are different options . But I am working now with what we call the received traditions : the final form of our Hebrew Bible that is in my Hebrew Bible and the final form of my Greek Bible that is in my Greek Bible that is also in my English Bible . <p> I will never forget , in 1990 I bought my first Hebrew Bible . It was November of 1990 . I was so excited because I had been taking Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the whole thing by now after two months of Hebrew . I was so excited . All of a sudden we had to turn to something like Ruth . It is that small , short book . You think : " What can I translate ? " Everyone goes for two things : Jonah and Ruth . They are short and relatively easy . I will never forget not being able to find Ruth . You are counting Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy , Joshua , Judges , Ruth . All of a sudden I am in Kings . Now I am befuddled . I can not find it . And then I see all of these other books I do not know . Here is a great one , Eikhah . What is that book ? Well , that is Lamentations . In Hebrew , the first word there is eikhah , " how oh Lord " . You have got all these problems . I will never forget that initial befuddlement . I guess from there on out , I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that important. ? <p> So far we have seen that there are two arrangements of the Old Testament : an English Bible arrangement ( and we will see where that comes from ) and a Hebrew Bible arrangement . The Hebrew Bible arrangement has three divisions . It begins with Abel in Genesis and ends with Zechariah in Chronicles . We have seen the criteria for the arrangement of the English Bible : genre , chronology and authorship . <p> We will take a break and we will come back . I will show you how the Hebrew Bible is structured . I think this will be very fascinating before you . This is going to be important . For me , the position of the book in the ordering determines , by and large , and in significant measure , the function of that book . Just like the position of a word in an English sentence determines function , so the position of a book in the Hebrew canon is going to determine function for you . This is going to be important to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need certain weapons at certain times . You need to know : When do I need a parachute versus when do I need a machine gun ? A machine gun is not going to help you if you jump out of a plane . You need the parachute for that . And a parachute is not going to help you if you are trapped in a bunker and you have to get out . You need a machine gun for that . So , it is important to know how these books function because they will tell you how best to use them in the church and in your life . Now let us take a break and we will come back and pick up the Hebrew Bible order . 
@@35723480 @4723480/ <h> Special Revelation ; Inspiration <h> Outline <p> I. Revelation <p> A. The Concept of Revelation <p> B. Forms of Revelation <p> 1 . Special Revelation <h> Special Revelation <p> Special revelation is distinguished from general revelation in two ways : Scope and Substance . Special revelation is specialized in scope . So only some people at some times received special revelation . Whereas , everyone all of the time , from the moment there were human beings to witness creation , witness general revelation ; it has been available to all people . All people have this a conscience , a moral sensibility built within . Romans 2 says the law is written on their hearts . So general revelation is general in scope , and special revelation is special . When God appeared to Moses in the wilderness at the burning bush , how many people received that revelation ? One person received that revelation . As it gets recorded for us in Scripture , we receive it second hand . But at that moment when God spoke to Moses , that is special revelation to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had n't been known before . It was given only to this one person . So it is specialized revelation in scope and also in substance . Moses asks , who shall I say sent me ? If he goes back to Israel in the land of Egypt and tells them God appeared to me and he told me to come back and let you know that he was going to deliver you , and they say , who was this God that appeared to you , what shall I tell them ? And God says , tell them I AM sent you ( Ex 3 ) . So here we have the revelation of God 's name , Yahweh . You ca n't get that from looking at the starry heavens or beautiful scenery . This has to be told to us . So special revelation is special in substance , in the actual content of what it reveals . So it is special in scope and special in substance . <h> a . Avenues of Special Revelation <h> 1 ) Personal Encounter <p> This is a category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is an altogether viable legitimate biblical category . The reason some have felt uncomfortable with it is because people , like Barth and Brunner even more so , in the Neo-Orthodox tradition turned most of the revelation into this category . You have a personal encounter with God so that you read the Bible as a witness to revelation , and as you read the Bible then God works through the Bible to come to you in personal encounter . For Brunner , in particular , in was a crisis experience that he talked about . So to distance ourselves from Neo-Orthodoxy , some in the evangelical tradition have been very reluctant to talk about this category . But it is all over the Bible . Just the example I used a moment ago : Moses . Is n't it a personal encounter ? Moses is walking along minding his own business , looks over to the side , and here is this bush on fire and what catches his eye is not only that this bush is on fire ( that is remarkable enough ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks and tries to figure this out . We know what is happening here ; God is present in this revelation of himself in this burning bush and then he speaks to Moses ; he makes himself known . This is a personal encounter with Moses . You read through the Bible and you find repeated experiences . Abraham and Jacob , you can just name them off , people who had personal encounters with God . These are recorded in Scripture for us . They really did happen and we need to understand this as one way God has chosen through the Scriptures to make himself known . Think of Paul on the road to Damascus , going there to persecute Christians . What happens to him ? Blinding light from heaven , and he claimed later that Christ actually revealed himself to him at that moment . That is what is recorded for us in Acts . So personal encounter is a vivid way in which God makes himself known . <p> This personal encounter can include the kind of thing that happened with Moses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine talking with God in that way , where you ask God a question and he answers . Moses asks , what shall I tell them when they ask me who sent me ? And God says , tell them such and such . That is incredible . Here you have this very real , direct conversation ; it is revelation that takes place . <p> There is also a kind of personal encounter that we see all through the Bible in dreams and visions as well . Think of the dreams that Daniel received , or think of Joseph , the dreams that God gave to Joseph . Of visions , Paul talks about being caught up into the higher sphere and how he does n't even know for sure where he was , or whether he was in a trance or not during this vision that he had . Think of the Apocalypse , the Book of Revelation and the visions that were given to John . So dreams and visions may also be avenues by which God makes himself known . <p> It is a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue . I am of the mind that God is free to do whatever God wants to do whenever God wants to do it . I do n't think that we have clear warrant to say , he no longer uses dreams or visions or that sort of thing . I do think that we have to be careful though . Here is where I stand with many , many conservative evangelicals . We have to be careful in being open to that kind of more direct revelation from God . It is up to him whether he does it or not . We do n't want to in any way threaten the absolute authority of the Bible . This is one of the things I fear happens pragmatically in Charismatic and Pentecostal circles . The notion of personal encounters , dreams , visions , God speaking words of knowledge and that sort of thing becomes prominent . And then there is a tendency to think of the Bible as that old book over there where God spoke in the past , but what we want is to hear God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charismatics who may be just as insistent as I am that we not do that . Wayne Grudem , who is a very good friend of mine , would be every bit as instant , although he holds a charismatic view on the gifts . One of the gifts that he is most famous for defending is the ongoing gift of prophecy . I do n't agree with him . I did at one time ; he had me convinced for a couple of years , but I have changed my mind on that again . I am back to where I was before . However , I know that Doctor Grudem is just insistent on not ever seeing the gift of prophecy in any way jeopardizing the absolute authority of Scripture , where alone God speaks inerrantly . We ca n't say that of human prophecies , as he understands them . Whether or not these continue is a good question , a valid question . But I just want you to know in answering the question of how God has revealed himself that we have got to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is theophany , direct revelation of God , a dream , or a vision . <h> 2 ) Mighty Act <p> The distinction between a personal encounter and a mighty act is in a mighty act you may not hear God speak ; there may not be a demonstration of his own person in speaking or making some truth known , but God manifests himself through some kind of powerful demonstration . To cite an example , in a personal encounter , God tells Moses I will deliver the people ; go back and tell them that I have heard their cry , and I have seen their affliction ; I have come down , and I will deliver them . Remember that is the way Exodus 2 ends . So Moses then goes back , they come out of Egypt after the plagues , and then God opens up the Red Sea . This is a mighty act . Have you ever put yourself in that moment , where on one side of you are thousands of Egyptian soldiers in chariots and armor and spears , and on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There you are , caught , stuck . You ca n't move , and what does God do ? He says just sleep on it ; just wait through the night , and in the morning you will see a great deliverance . In the morning , they see the waters parted , walls of water on their left and their right as they walk across on dry ground . Then they get to the other side and the enemy is pursuing and they think , oh no we have been delivered just to be killed anyway . Here they are , coming after us , and what does God do ? He brings the waters back down . Every single Egyptian soldier is killed by the flood of water that comes upon them . They see bodies floating on the water . And it says at the end of that chapter that they bowed and worshiped God . This is mighty act . <p> Or think of another moment . Just recently I was thinking about when Hezekiah received the letter from Sennacherib that boasted of Assyria 's prowess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipe out Jerusalem . How does your God compare to all of the other gods we have destroyed , says Sennacherib ? This was huge mistake . So Sennacherib sends his soldiers and Hezekiah prays . Remember how he spreads the letter out before the Lord . He pleads with God , for your name 's sake , oh God , show yourself to be God over the nations . In the night , an angel comes . Think of this , an angel , just one . How many of God 's force do you need to lick 185,000 soldiers ? Just one . In that night 185,000 Assyrian soldiers are killed . At that time , the whole walled city of Jerusalem was a little bit larger than the larger boundaries of Southern Baptist Seminary 's campus . It is a little bit bigger than that , not a whole lot bigger . Can you imagine waking up that morning and going over and peering over the wall wondering if you are going to get shot with a spear or an arrow or something and what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , there were probably 20,000 to 30,000 people who lived there , at the most . They were no match for this army and the Assyrian were all dead . This is mighty act . <p> What about the empty tomb ? Mighty act . You see God making himself known in demonstrations of his power throughout the Scriptures . <h> 3 ) Propositional Revelation <p> This category , just because of the name given to it , is sometimes misunderstood . It does not mean that this is revelation that comes in the form of didactic propositions , as opposed to other kinds of speech . Straight forward statements , propositional statements , is not what this is . The term is a bit misleading . Actually what it simply means is revelation that comes in human language . It probably ought to be called " linguistic revelation " instead of propositional . But that is the term we have traditionally been using . Propositional revelation is just revelation that comes in human language . So when God speaks , this is propositional revelation . When Jesus speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of the Lord , that is propositional revelation . When the apostles write under the inspiration , that is propositional revelation . Propositional revelation is larger than Scripture in the sense that all of Scripture is propositional revelation , but you ca n't reverse that statement ; not all of propositional revelation is Scripture . Do we have every word that Jesus spoke ? No , we know we do n't because John even told us so . " There are many more things that he he did and if we tried to write them all down , all the books in world could not contain them " ( Jn 21:25 ) . Do we have every word that Jesus spoke ? No . Then we do n't have all of the propositional revelation that he gave . Everything he spoke , he spoke as God in human form . In all of Scripture do we have everything that every prophet spoke to the people that God sent them to speak to ? No , we have sort of summary records by inspiration that get their messages to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have every word that was spoken . So , propositional revelation is larger than Scripture . It is revelation every time God , whether directly or through one of his agents , a prophet or Apostle , speaks or writes what is the Word of God . If it is the Word of God in human language , that is propositional revelation . All of the Bible is that because , all Scripture is God breathed ( 2 Timothy 3:16 ) . <h> 4 ) Incarnation <p> There is a sense in which it is right to distinguish this category from the others , although it includes all three of the previous ones . In Christ , is n't this personal encounter par excellence ? Think of John 1:18 , " No one has seen God at anytime , the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father . " Guess what ? He has made him known . Jesus , appearing in human flesh , manifesting the invisible God , tabernacling among is personal encounter big time . Are mighty acts demonstrated in Jesus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in which ( in the Gospel of John , for example ) the signs of Jesus are so important . Jesus even said in chapter John 10:25 , " If you do n't believe my words , the words that I say to you , believe on account of the works that I do . " He is referring to his miracles . Look at the works and ask yourself this question , how can he do this ? Who is able to do this ? Is Jesus ' revelation propositional revelation ? Well of course . He is giving discourses : the Sermon on the Mount , woes to the Pharisees , parables . All of these revelations of Jesus in language are propositional revelation . I suppose you could say , well that does it does n't it ? Well it does n't . We have to have a separate category , even though incarnation involves all three of the previous ones . Hebrews 1 marks off the revelation in Christ as something unique and distinctive that ought to be noted specially . <p> Heb 1:1 God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophets in many portions and in many ways , <p> So yes , God has spoken ; we have had revelation for thousands of years . He has spoken through lots of different prophets at lots of different times . We are not short on revelation ; we have had a lot of it but , <p> Heb 1:2 in these last days has spoken to us in his Son , <p> So you have this sense of light and heavy , preliminary and full in the contrast the writer of Hebrews is making . <p> Heb 1:2 in these last days has spoken to us in his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the world . <p> Heb 1:3 And he is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature , and upholds all things by the word of his power . <p> We have this exalted portrayal of Jesus as the one who is exactly representing God and who , according to Hebrews , now makes God known . <p> A similar kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word was God . <p> John 1:14 And the Word became flesh , and dwelt among us , and we saw his glory , glory as of the only begotten from the Father , <p> Do you want to know what the Father looks like , look at Jesus . <p> John 1:14 ... full of grace and truth . I have a sermon I preach on this , and I am tempted to stop right now and preach it to you , but I wo n't . If you notice in that prologue of John grace and truth is used twice . The point of that is that when John says , " We beheld his glory , glory as of the only begotten from the Father , " you could stop right there and ask the question , in what ways did Jesus manifest the glory of the Father ? How is Jesus like his Father ? There are many ways Jesus is like the Father , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular : grace and truth . In Hebrew ' ' Chesed vah ' emeth ' ' is loving kindness , mercy , grace and truth now in Jesus . These two qualities are made known . It is very interesting that you can find in the Hebrew Bible these key references to God as being the God who abounds in lovingkindness and truth . I think Exodus 34:6 is one of those references , and through the Psalms you find it over and over again . So John wants us to see , in particular that this is the Father manifest in Jesus , full of grace and truth . I think the point is that as we read the Gospel of John we have in mind , all the way through , how does Jesus manifest simultaneously grace and truth ? With his mother in chapter 2 , with Nicodemus in chapter 3 , with the Samaritan woman chapter 4 ; how does Jesus manifest grace and truth ? How should we live ? It has been one the most practical challenges in my adult life as a believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain contexts ( of course , I do all the time and so do you , but there are certain public formats in which I feel the weight of representing Christ ) . And I think of this and pray that God would enable me to be like Jesus who is full of grace and truth . It is a remarkable thing because usually we think of one canceling out the other or compromising the other . Very gracious people are kind of weak on truth . Very truthful people are harsh often times and they cut with truth ; they hit with truth ; they destroy with truth , they are not gracious . Grace and truth are in the incarnation . The fullest manifestation of God that has ever been made is in Jesus . <p> One more comment on this and I will make this short . In Christ we have the fullest revelation of God that has been known , but do n't confuse that with a corresponding doctrine that we have to put alongside of it to balance things out to get a healthy Christology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Christ took on human flesh , he laid aside something ; he poured himself out . It is very important to realize that Jesus lived his life as a man , and therefore certain things that would be true of his nature as God are not necessarily allowed expression . How else do you explain Mark 13:32 concerning the Second Coming ? Jesus says that no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , or the Son of Man . Does God know the hour of the Second Coming ? Yes . Did Jesus say that he ( Jesus ) does n't ? Yes . In fact that was a text that Arius used to support his denial of the deity of Christ . You can see why , ca n't you ? It is very clear God is omniscient , but Jesus says that he does n't know this , ergo Jesus is not God , according to Arius . <p> We do n't want to say when we are looking at Jesus that everything about God is fully manifest . This was Moltmann 's big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cross , Moltmann said , we see weakness , God in weakness , feeling our pain . Now wait a minute . Besides the God-man who was hanging on the cross , we have the Father God reigning supreme over sin and death as he brings to an end all that stands against him through his son . This is power . It just wo n't do to say , in the cross we see weakness . This is a faulty picture , so we 've got to be careful in seeing in Christ the fullest expression of God that we have ever known but not confuse that with the fact that he purposely concealed aspects of deity to live like a human among us. <h> b . Efficacy of Special Revelation <p> General revelation is efficacious ; it is able to hold us accountable before God because it shows us sufficiently that there is a God and some things about him . His power and his divine nature are clearly made known Paul says in Romans 1 . Yet general revelation is not efficacious for salvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides revelation of God 's grace and mercy to save sinners . Special revelation has to be made known in order for that saving truth to come to people . Yet we also understand from Scripture that just the revelation alone , in itself , is efficacious to save . It is saving revelation in the sense that it does present the truth of the gospel , the truth of God 's grace in Christ . But there is the presentation of the truth and also the question of the reception of the truth . The presentation alone does not guarantee the truth will be received , as any of you know who has shared the Gospel . To share it does not necessarily mean that it will be received . But there is no hope of being saved apart from the fact that there is this special revelation that is given . The fullness of the Gospel is God 's grace in redemptive history leading up to the coming of Christ and all that happens in Christ , his life , death and resurrection . It all comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will witness to the world ; this is the whole package ( when you think of biblical redemptive historical history ) ; it is what God intends for his people to know to be saved and to grow to be conformed more and more to his image <p> Class Questions <p> Can you be an exclusivist and believe that a person apart from Bible and apart from Christian witness could put faith in Christ because God gave to that person or that community special revelation ? <p> I have heard testimony ( I do not know how to verify or to falsify these things that I heard ) , that there are groups of Muslims who have come to Christ through a personal revelation of Christ to their community . I do n't have any reason to think that it is n't true or any reason to think that it is true . But is that , in principle , possible ? Yes . Christ came to Paul that way . Here he is going up the road to Damascus , fully intent on gathering Christians to put them prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals himself . I think we have good reason to say from Scripture that clearly the norm is that we go to the world ( Matt 28:19-20 ) . But remember Matthew 28 , Acts 1:8 and Acts 2 ( the Spirit given at Pentecost ) happened before Paul was visited by Jesus . So evidently , having said , " Go to the all the world and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them , " God still took the prerogative to come to Paul directly . So can that happen ? Yes , it did . Might that happen again ? That is up to God . But clearly the norm is that we go , we share , they hear . Even Paul , who was saved by this special revelation of God , in Romans 10:13-15 says , " Whosoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved , but how shall they call upon one in whom they have never believed ; how shall they believe on one whom they have never heard ; how shall they hear unless there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sent ; how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news . " Here is Paul who was saved through this special revelation , but nonetheless realizes that clearly the norm is Christian people , who are given this precious gift of the Gospel , to go out and share it . So yes exclusiveism is possible , but I would not encourage anyone to count on that as the mechanism by which people will be saved throughout the world . <p> In Romans 8:16 Paul writes about the Spirit bearing witness with our spirits that we are children of God . Is that revelation ? <p> I feel comfortable using the term revelation . One reason I do is because in a very similar kind of way the actual term is used , ' ' apokalupto ' ' , in Ephesians 1:17 in Paul 's prayer . This is not Romans 8 , but it is the same kind of idea though . In Ephesians 1 he writes , " Of having heard of the faith that exist among you , and your love for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you making mention of you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory may give to you . " This is now , you Christian people , now in your own Christian lives , in your own Christian experience . That he may give to a Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him . That is ' ' apokalupto ' ' . " I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened " ( Eph 1:18 ) . I take it verse 18 spans this notion of what he means in verse 17 : The eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that your heart may grasp , your affection may be aroused to see the beauty and the splendor and the glory so you embrace truth that your mind has been privileged to know . May your heart see it and the eyes of your heart grasp it so that you will know what is the hope of his calling . Know it in a fuller , richer , deeper sense as Christian people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses . I think that it is arguable that his use of revelation in this context is equivalent to illumination . It is taking truth and shining the spotlight on it and shining it on your heart so that this effect occurs , this growth occurs . So I do n't know that it really differs from illumination in concept , but it is interesting that he uses the term ' ' apokalupto ' ' for it . I take it that this is very similar to what Paul is thinking of in Romans 8 , with the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit . So there is something that happens internally , subjectively : a witness to the truth that we are the children of God in our own soul . <h> II . Inspiration <h> A. Definition <h> 1 . General Meaning <p> The term inspiration is not a particularly apt term in some ways because we use it in colloquial kinds of ways . We talk about Shakespeare or Mozart being inspired . Then we talk about Paul being inspired . Or we talk about a pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inspiration then ? We talk about your third grade student who wrote a poem being inspired . It is meant to be a translation of the word ' ' theopneustos ' ' which is a term found in 2 Timothy 3:16 for God breathed . ' ' Theos ' ' ( God ) , ' ' pneustos ' ' from ' ' pneumo s ' ' which is the Greek word for spirit or breath . It is only used that one time in the Bible so we ca n't really look elsewhere for it . It is pretty clear from the joining of the two terms what it means : God breathed . Inspiration is suppose to communicate that notion . It does n't do it real well . Actually a better term in one way and worse in another would be " expiration . " Then you have " spirit " which is this breathing notion , but you have " spiriting out " ( " ex " or exit , out of ) . That would actually be closer to what ' ' theopneustos ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mean in English ? Expiration is when someone dies ; you say they expired , so that is not going to work well to communicate the idea . We are stuck with inspiration . That is the word we 've got ; that 's the word we will live with , but let 's be clear on what it means . It means then , the out-breathing of God to produce his Word . <p> That out-breathing takes place through human agency . So prophets and Apostles write . And as they write , at least in most cases , the Bible is not the result of dictation . There are sometimes when God tells the prophet , go to the people and say this . That might be dictation , that 's fine , but most of the Bible is not in that category . Most of the Bible is an author of Scripture ( a prophet or an Apostle ) writing what he wants to write , and as he writes what he wants to write , it is what God has breathed out to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? As Paul writes to the Galatians , in Galatians 4:19 he says , " I am as a woman in labor until Christ is formed in you . " What a vivid image even for a man to say who has n't experienced childbirth . What a vivid image ; he is as a woman in labor . As he writes what he wants to write , this is the Word of God breathed out through the Apostle , through the prophet , through the writer of Scripture . <p> Inspiration communicates this notion of the out-breathing of God to produce his Word . It happens through human agency . So people write , and what they choose to write , what they want to write , is in fact what God has breathed out or intended that they write . These happened together . This is an example , by the way , of one those mega issues where we will spend a fair bit of time of what is called " concurrence . " God 's sovereignty and human agency are working together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency is at work as Paul writes the book of Galatians ; he writes what he wants to write . However , God 's sovereignty is at work as he works in Paul and through Paul ; as Paul writes what he wants , God gets what he wants . This is why you take languages in seminary because of the conviction that every word , every grammatical construction , every syntactical arrangement of language that you find in the Scripture , all of it is God 's Word . So is it a perfect as opposed to an aorist ? You pay attention . If there is a conjunction here you pay attention . Why do you pay such close attention to all of these grammatical features and care to notice the syntax ; why do you do that ? Because of a conviction that this is , in fact , the Word of God as he intended it to be , all of it . <p> On another note , some of you know that Dr Schreiner debated two Arminian theologians from Asbury Seminary back in April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church that sponsored this . It was quite an evening for Dr Schreiner and me with over a thousand kids ( I call them kids , they were 17 to 25 years old for the most part ) . It was not like a theology debate ; it was like a rock concert at the beginning . One of the points I tried to make in dealing with whole notion of sovereignty and human freedom , compatiblism , and concurrence is that inspiration is an enormously powerful testimony of the compatibility of free agency and divine sovereignty . You see , if people have libertarian freedom in the way that Arminians talk about freedom ( you are always free to do otherwise ) that means that for every word Paul wrote , he could have written otherwise . And here is the key when it comes to inspiration : God ca n't control what words Paul chooses . Yet you believe that all of the Bible , written by these human beings is , in fact , the Word of God . Well the only conclusion I can draw is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds of getting every word , every grammatical feature , every syntactical arrangement just the way God wants it through libertarian , free human beings . Just calculate the odds . You get the point ; it is just ludicrous to imagine that to be the case . The only way you really account for the doctrine of inspiration is to say that God worked in the mind and hearts of the writers , so what they wrote was their own , and it was his simultaneously . <h> 2 . Verbal , Plenary Inspiration <p> ' ' ' Verbal Inspiration ' ' ' <p> Verbal inspiration refers to the fact that all of the language of the Bible is inspired : its words , its grammar , its syntax . Every bit of the language is breathed out from God as his Word . That is verbal inspiration . <p> ' ' ' Plenary Inspiration ' ' ' <p> Have you been to a conference where they have breakout sessions , workshop sessions , and then they have plenary sessions . What are those ? It is where everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The language of the Bible , all of its details , the words , the syntax , the grammar in all of its parts , in totality verbal plenary is the product of God 's out breathing . <p> We affirm verbal plenary inspiration of the text of Scripture , not the authors of Scripture . We do n't say that Paul was verbally plenarily inspired . We say the Bible is verbally plenarily , completely inspired . We affirm of the Bible , first and foremost inspiration because the only time the term is used is 2 Timothy 3:16 , ' ' theopneustos ' ' ; and what is it used of ? All Scripture is inspired by God . In a secondary sense ( please note it is secondary ) , you might refer to the Apostle Paul as being inspired as he writes , but that is not a technically precise way to talk from the Scripture . Because " inspiration " is used one time , in 2 Timothy 3:16 , and what it refers to as inspired is what Paul writes , not Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't even a believer . He was a pagan sorcerer in the book of Numbers . The Spirit worked in him to do this ; God did it . We have the same process going on , but it is easier to think of Paul under inspiration than it is Balaam under inspiration because he is a pagan . What is inspired primarily is the Bible . There is also 2 Peter 1:21 which speaks of men who were moved by the Holy Spirit and spoke from God . Men were moved by the Holy Spirit , so there clearly is a sense in which the Spirit moves in their hearts and minds , so what they speak and write is , in fact , the Word of God . In that secondary sense , you can talk about them being inspired or moved by the Spirit . The primary sense of inspiration is the text itself ; the Bible is inspired . All of its language , in all of its parts are verbally plenarily inspired . <h> B. Key Passages and their Teachings <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important passages in helping us understand the nature of Scripture . <p> 2 Ti 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed <p> Here is that term ' ' theopneustos ' ' ; it is inspired by God . <p> 2 Ti 3:16 ... and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness ; 2 Ti 3:17 so that the man of God may be adequate , equipped for every good work . <p> These words are so familiar that I think we can read them and miss the utterly incredible claims that are being made . Meditate on them ; they are just astonishing for training in righteousness . Look at the whole realm of what Scripture can do . Look at what it is profitable to do : to reprove , to correct , to build up in righteousness , to teach in righteousness so that the man of God may be adequate and equipped for every good work . It ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground in shame because of what we know is true from surveys of how little time pastors spend reading , memorizing , and meditating on Scripture . They read every hot new book that comes out with some techniques for growing a big church , and they plow through those things and ca n't wait to get the next one . This verse says , " So that the man of God may be adequate , equipped for every good work . " So you if you believe it , then practice it . <h> a . Translation Issue All or Every <p> The New English Bible translates this passage as follows : " Every God-Breathed Scripture is profitable for teaching and reproof . " <p> Every God-breathed Scripture is profitable ; do you sense the difference ? You have the God-breathed and , in principle , the not God-breathed Scripture . In that case it is n't profitable and you would n't want to follow that stuff , of course . It allows for this discretion of the reader in terms of what is God-breathed and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way the language works here , it is not a legitimate understanding . All Scripture is God breathed ; ' ' pasa graph theopneustos kai phelimos ' ' . It is referring to all of Scripture ( ' ' pasa graph ' ' ) . It is all of Scripture ; it is not referring to every Scripture which is profitable . Part of the problem is what do with the copula ( the " is " ) . Where do you insert the " is " and what do you do with the " and " ? Listen again to a traditional translation , " All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable . " Now listen to the New English . " Every God-breathed Scripture is profitable . " Do you notice a particular word missing ? " And " ( ' ' kai ' ' ) . It just drops out of the picture . But it is in there , look at your Greek text ; it is in there . ' ' Kai ' ' is in there . It says , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is two things : ' ' theopneustos kai phelimos ' ' , God-breathed and profitable . The same case endings of those two terms ought to kept together connected by the ' ' kai ' ' ( and ) , so what you ought not do is split them up and make one of them all God-breathed Scripture . Where is the ' ' kai ' ' ? This is why all the major translations ( with exceptions for what I must say is theological bias ) , translated in some version of what you have in NIV , NASB , English Standard Version , Revised Standard Version all go the same way with this : that all Scripture is inspired and profitable . <h> b . Meaning of inspiration <p> It is interesting that Paul puts in order what he does . Mainly that all Scripture is inspired , then profitable . I think the reason for that is that he wants to make it clear that inspiration is first . This is foundational . So all Scripture is God-breathed . This is what it is ; this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is unlike any other book that has ever been written . Even though many Christian people will testify that in writing sometimes there is a sense of God moving , preachers will certainly talk about times when they sensed the Lord took over and spoke through them . I do n't doubt that things like that happened , but there is no other writing , no other speech , that is equivalent to the writing that has taken place in this book . It is all God-breathed , all the way through . So we need to understand Scripture in its fullness as the Word of God . <p> Some may thing that this limits God . But how is that limiting to God if God chose to do it that way . Then it is presumptuous and rude . What if I wrote a letter to my wife and took great care in crafting just what I wanted to say . And she got this letter and said , " My relationship with my husband is just too precious and intimate to be conveyed in language , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am just going to relate to my husband , but I am not going to read this . " What would I think ? I would be ticked . Ca n't you see that you can convey your mind and heart in what you write ? My brother-in-law is a pastor , a very fine pastor and a wonderful man . One of his favorite metaphors that he uses for his people all the time is the Bible as God 's love letter . This is God 's message to his people , primarily . It relates to the world more broadly , but it is particularly to the people of God for guiding them into life , life and joy that will be theirs now and for eternity . And this we have because of inspiration . <h> c . Ontology and Function ( What it is and what it does ) <p> Notice that when Paul says all Scripture is inspired , that indicates what it is . That is ontology . It is the Word of God . It is breathed out by God . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what it does . But notice the order of the " is " and the " does . " Ontology precedes function . What something is precedes what it does . Further more what something can do is a function of what it is . <p> If you have a 1969 Rambler ( Do any of you even know what that is ? I remember them ) and you want to enter it in the Indianapolis 500 , it is just not going to work to do this . It is not made to be a race car ; it will not function as a race car . Notice those two words . It is not made . It is not something therefore it can not do something . What something does is a function of what it is . <p> The reason that we can have confidence that the Bible is profitable for teaching , reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness that the man of God may be adequately equipped for every good work is because it is the Word of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share this with evangelicals broadly , is that the minute you begin to tear down the quality of what the Bible is , you can not help but effect what it is able to do , what kind of guide it is for life and what kind of guide it is for ethics . Paul Juliet , in his understanding of how inspiration worked thinks that God gave to human beings concepts that got reflected in better or worse ways depending upon how well they understood those concepts and how much they were affected by their culture and all of that . So for example , when Paul writes what he does in I Timothy 2 , " I do n't allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man " ( 1 Tim 2:12 ) and when he writes in Ephesians 5 about wives submitting to your husbands , Paul was just not in tune with God very well yet on those points . But when he writes in Galatians 3:28 that , " There is no distinction between Jew and Gentile slave or free , male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ok Paul Juliet . Here we have a Bible , supposedly the Word of God , where we really have in this passage the Word of God and in this passage the faulty word of Paul . That 's the nature of this book , fine , but how well does it function ? All of a sudden you 've got a problem because how are we to know where those problem areas are ? It does n't come with a guide that tells you these parts here you can forget that ; they did n't get that part right , but these over here , pay attention to those . It does n't come with a guide , so who becomes the guide ? The reader . You and I decide ; we become the judge on what is acceptable and what is n't . We determine where Scripture is in fact profitable for teaching , reproof , correction and so on . <p> So function follows ontology . Do you see how important it is to affirm what 2 Timothy 3:16 affirms ; all Scripture is God-breathed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation , without qualification it really is profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness . 
@@35723484 @4723484/ <h> Modern Day Guruism in India and the West <p> I made a few comments about these men . I showed you their pictures before , but I want to make sure that we 're clear on some of the main points there . Then we 'll do some festivals and , I think , we 'll finally be through with this third cycle of the devotional marga . So , then we can go back and begin to show how it all relates together . So next class period , you can make a note to make sure you bring your chart , because we 'll be going back to that chart and making some integrative comments about the chart next time . Lord willing . <p> Question : What chart ? <p> The chart that has the three vehicles of modern Hinduism " jnana marga , karma marga , bhakti marga . That chart . And I 'll bring some extra copies in case any of you forget . I know that 's highly unlikely anybody here will forget , but just in case . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already indicated , is it brings together ... and we 've seen how much of this is now happening ... where things are integrated from various parts of the marga system . So essentially you have often high caste or Brahminical leaders who are recognising that the bhakti movement could essentially rob them of their power . And so the bhakti movement has been incorporated back into Brahminical Hinduism . So Brahmins will often dominate Bhaktism as well by saying they are a particular incarnation of a god or they are a particular channel to god " which is what Joy so powerfully shared with us last time with her experience . So because of that , it has really broadened , and in some ways continues to show how the margas relate one to another . <p> A few figures we want to focus on that I think tie into many Western influences as well . The first is Paramhansa Ramkrishna . This is a Hindu mystic who declared , not just the unity of Hinduism , which we have seen in the gurus , but the unity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family in Bengal . He actually has strong Brahminical background in all of his roots . You know , you remember " typically you find in North India Shaivite ; south India Vaishnavite . In his case he grows up in the east over in Bengal and he becomes a priest of Kali , who you 're very well acquainted with now . <p> He became ecstatically devoted to Kali and spent many , many hours , reportedly , weeping , going through various puja experiences , ecstatic experiences , until he actually had a vision of the goddess , according to his belief " of Devi herself . He was so enraptured by this that he could no longer hold down an ordinary job , even in the temple . And he began to study under some other Brahmins who taught him various meditative techniques . One he gained a particular lot from a particular Brahmin woman , as well as this sadhu whose name was Tota Puri , who was famous because he refused to ever wear any clothes . I guess that 's one reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any clothes because he was focused on his meditation . <p> Ramakrishna began to practise these meditative techniques and he claims that he had a vision of Krishna and Radha , who you now also are well aware of . He had further visions of Krishna and Kali , which we already discussed . But then eventually " and this really , I think , is what makes him important " is that he claimed to have a vision of Jesus Christ and of Mohammed . And this is a very important ... from a pure historical point of view ... quite apart from how we might unwrap this as Christians . A very historical point of view , this is another major step in terms of how Hinduism has interacted with the modern world , especially other religions . <p> What he essentially does is he says that in this vision he saw that there were not just three paths to enlightenment .

And so , you ca n't really have three paths in Hinduism . Ultimately there 's got to be some way this is part of one singular vision . <p> So he claims that there 's not ... it 's not jnana marga , karma marga and bhakti marga , but there are hundreds of paths to enlightenment , including Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Sikhism and Jainism , among others . He declared that all religions are different paths to the one eternal being who he simply calls as you might expect , sat cit ananda " the whole sat cit ananda doctrine we discussed as well . It goes back to the Upanishads . <p> So here 's a guy who very cleverly is connecting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India " a Brahminical teacher especially . So he ties everything into sat cit ananda from the ? ? ? Upanishad . He is leaning heavily into the whole bhakti movement by drawing upon the popular stands . And he 's trying to basically find a way to transcend this whole discussion we had earlier about the relationship of devotion , knowledge and works . Or is it like this : knowledge , devotion , works . OK , we 've looked a lot at this kind of paradigm , and this is ... there 's no question this is a tension within Hinduism about what is ultimate . Essentially this is a battle over jnana marga and bhakti marga , obviously . So if you have essentially the Brahmins over here arguing for knowledge and you have the masses of people that are now called scheduled caste or the broad non-upper caste people arguing for Bhaktism , then you essentially have this pressure between these two that could essentially create fracturing , which is not part of the Hindu vision . <p> So he 's saying : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of this . And sat cit ananda ( being , consciousness , bliss ) , this whole doctrine of the Upanishads , is the overarching thing which not only unites this but all religions together . He says , for example , and I 'm quoting him here : " Both Kali and Brahman , both Krishna and Christ , are different aspects of the same reality . " Now , there 's nobody in jnana marga who would argue that Kali and Brahman are the same . Kali is something that 's over here " that people worship in ignorance . Brahman is the all-pervading , you know , nirguna Brahman . You can say nothing about it and all that . So to equate Kali and Brahman is itself pretty radical , although we could see that in many of the bhakti movements in south India , especially the Tamils . But between Krishna and Christ ? This is now taking a stand that begins to integrate Hinduism with how it relates to other religions " which we 've not seen a lot of in this course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do Hindus see themselves relating to Christianity , much in a formal way . <p> So Ramakrishna had a number of followers . His most important was a man that is now known to you . His name was Narendra Nath Datta , who today is known as Swami Vivekananda . This was his most devoted follower and this is the one who brought the message of Ramakrishna to the Western world . You ? ? ? have his dates there before you . And again , you can see in his name all of these figures take names that , you know , you see with Ramakrishna . You see the name Rama and Krishna in his name . That in itself is interesting . That is a very bhakti name . But with Vivekananda , this actually is a very important suffix for a Swami , a teacher . An enlightened teacher always has the name ananda at the end of it . So everyone recognises it . An ordinary person does not call themselves ananda . <p> And , in fact , I feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works out . In my own writing in India , if I 'm writing for a Hindu audience , I never publish under the name Timothy Tennent , because it 's immediately recognised as a Western name . So , if it 's a book , if it 's a scholarly book , like my book on , part of our textbook , that book which is now in Hindi is under Timothy Tennent . That 's fine . But if it 's any thing like tracts , pamphlets , booklets , my name is Praymraj Dharmananda . And I ? ? ? that name . Dharmananda " dharma ananda . Because people who see that recognise it as a teacher . And they will read it as someone who is an Indian who teaches . It 's actually very , very common all through Indian history . People always publish under pen names . It 's not at all unusual . <p> Narendra Nath Datta took on the name Swami Vivekananda and he taught that the Vedantic ideal was true . He accepts tat twan asi . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the problem with tat twam asi is that it is not something that only a Brahmin can have an insight into . So you have the same thing here . On the one hand , he is tipping his hat to the jnana marga , saying I acknowledge that the Brahmins are right " that the greatest insight of the Upanishads is tat twam asi , thou art that . But they were mistaken in thinking only Brahmins could perceive this unity . He said there are many ways , many paths , through which someone can perceive this unity . And he does not deny the Brahmins can achieve it through their Brahminical way of knowledge , but he says there are other paths that equally help someone achieve the insight of tat twam asi . <p> So now you 're finding the ? ? ? by some of these Brahmins to broaden the Upanishadic vision to encompass even the most popular movements and even other religions . He calls this neovedantism . This is a new vedantism . The result is , as you can see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that are very important in the history of Hinduism . <p> The first is the emergence of social ethics . The moment you distance yourself from a Brahminical exclusive religion and you open the door to other classes or castes of people , then this provides an avenue through which you can enfranchise somebody rather than disenfranchise them . Because , up to this point , the sudras especially are disenfranchised , and the dalits even more so . They have no hope but , hopefully , through improving their karmic debt , maybe be reborn as a Brahmin someday . That 's about the only hope they have . Now they have hope because they can ... I 'm saying this obviously , speaking as a Hindu , they have hope . I know from the point of view of the gospel , they need the gospel . But I 'm saying , from their perspective , they have hope because now there is an avenue through which a person who 's not a Brahmin can achieve enlighten and have the essential unity of tat twam asi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laid out by Ramanuja , but we 're not there yet . <p> And by the way , this is very , very popular nineteenth century stuff . Nineteenth century , if you know the general literature of nineteenth century in general in the Western world that deeply influenced the East . This was the heyday of natural theology , of general revelation , of ? ? ? optimisms before World War I , World War II , which throws us in this horrible pessimistic period . People were very optimistic about human nature , what could be perceived and known . So this is all part of a general intellectual milieu that Hinduism is also drawing from . So , social ethics is pouring into Hinduism as a part of this overall optimism about the human race and what we can accomplish , what we can do , how we can help each other and on and on and on . <p> The British Raj is in their heyday in India . And do n't forget , the figure I did my doctoral work on , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . He is probably the most important early leader of the nationalistic movement . He 's the one who started the whole nationalistic movement in Bengal , which is where it all was given birth and where later Ghandi would pick up and use a lot of his own techniques that he would use . But if you read his early writings ... I mean , the man can find nothing wrong with the British . It 's the greatest thing in the world . This is god 's gift to us . I mean , you wo n't believe it " I mean , just gushingly , gushingly positive about the British presence in India . <p> It really is n't until 1905 that you ... August 1905 when the British partitioned Bengal that you really begin to find negative reactions spring up about the British presence there . Now that 's still some years before Ghandi , so this takes a long time obviously 1947 to really finally fully blow up . <p> But in these early , early , late nineteenth century , very positive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the British lay the telegraph line and somebody talks between Bombay , now Mumbai , and Calcutta . They could n't believe it . How could somebody on one side of the country talk to someone on the other side of the country ? They could n't believe it . And they connected a line that went from ... I 'm not sure where it was . It was somewhere in north India , maybe Bhopal or somewhere , up to Delhi . And they just could n't believe that people could talk to people between Delhi and Bhopal . It just blew their minds . All the literature on this was just O effusive . The British were just wonderful . All these riches coming into our country . <p> There were people who were so amazed by the train station . In fact , when they first laid the tracks in India , there were many of the villagers who had never seen a train before . And they did n't know what they were doing . They saw them strapping these huge metal , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And word got out that the British were actually going to use these belts to hook India up to a barge and pull India all the way to Britain like a big floating barge . Just pull India to Britain . Join it all together " one big happy family . I mean , it 's unbelievable literature in this time period . So , none of this is a surprise . <p> But the second thing that happened that 's important is what we 've discussed in a larger sense when the missionaries came , but Vivekananda is another missionary , just a Hindu missionary , the reification of Hinduism . This is definitely happening in full bore nineteenth century . Prior to this time , the word Hinduism has never been used to describe holistically the religion of this group of people , 82% of India . There are people who worship Ram , people who worship Krishna , people who worship ... there are Vaishnavites , Shaivites , and so forth . It is not until this period that you begin to find Hinduism emerging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind which is a great advancement on the overall Hindu ideal . <p> So Vivekananda argues for many paths , one vision . And so it helps to say that Hinduism is not some fractured , horrible distortion of multiple belief systems that are hopelessly contradictory , which it certainly is at any observable level " but O beyond all this observable contradictions and fractions and various subdivisions is in fact a unified vision . That 's a very important thing , if that 's true , because that is a reification that 's occurring that makes Hinduism a point of study , like this class . <p> The third thing is that Hinduism becomes now a major player in the global religious vision of the world . Hinduism as a world religion " what has often been called the birth of the saffron mission . Now that 's the title of a book that came out maybe three or four years ago by CB Matthew entitled The Saffron Mission . It talks about essentially the birth of Hinduism seeing itself as an evangelistic movement . <p> Back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be divided between those who were evangelistic and those who were not . And he said the evangelistic religions would include Christianity , Islam and Theravada Buddhism . All the others are non-evangelistic . But that 's no longer possible today to talk in those terms because Hinduism , especially in the nineteenth century , took on this idea of we can spread the message of Hinduism around the world and the world will benefit from it . It 's called the saffron mission . <p> That really culminates in the very , very famous speech of Swami Vivekananda at the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 . I can not overestimate the importance of this speech he gave at the World Parliament of Religions 1893 . He actually gave two addresses . This was the birth of Hinduism in America especially and more broadly in the Western world . I have a copy of both of his addresses to pass out to you because I think it 's that important . It 's like Mar5tin Luther King 's I have a Dream speech , in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . <p> And so , it 's not just that Vivekananda said it . It 's the fact that what he said resonates so powerfully with the participants in this gathering of people who gathered . It was a Parliament , a gathering of religious representatives from all over the world to discuss how religions interact with each other . The result was , I do n't think any of our lives have been the same since this speech because it electrified those who were there . In fact , if you look at the literature , when people left that meeting ... and this goes on for ... this was several weeks of meetings ... this is a long ... not just a one day affair ... it 's like ten or twelve days . This gathering which had hundreds and hundreds of people participants from all over the world , everyone when they came back home and wrote their reports and reflected on ... they 're all Vivekananda , Vivekananda , Vivekananda . If you go ask anybody who 's a scholar of this period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most memorable event of the Parliament of Religions , they 'll say Swami Vivekananda 's speech . And so , I 'm going to pass it out to you , both . He gave one and then he was asked to give a closing speech at the end because he was so ? ? ? electrifying thing . But it 's affected modern-day pluralistic attitudes dramatically . And I think in some ways ... Yes . <p> Question : ? ? ? <p> You do live in Chicago ? <p> Question : ? ? ? <p> Yeah , it was 93 . Yeah , it was the hundredth anniversary of it . Right . <p> Question : ? ? ? <p> O really . <p> Question : ? ? ? downstairs in a convention hall , all the booths set up . It was interesting to walk through and ping-pong ? ? ? all side by side . Latter Day Saints trying to like get you ? ? ? trying to proselytise you ? ? ? <p> I can imagine . I can imagine . Well , you got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't read the entire thing to you , but I want to read a few parts of this . If you look at the first page , which is the opening address on September 11 , 1893 , which begins : " Sisters and brothers of America " . If you look down in the second paragraph , he said : " I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance . We believe not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true . " Now you see how that is the original Ramakrishna vision ? So Vivekananda came West . He did n't want to start the Vivekananda mission , but the Ramakrishna mission . He claims that Ramakrishna is an incarnation of Chatainya whom we have not studied . We do n't have time to study . Chatainya is an incarnation , a reincarnation , of Krishna . There is Krishna . There is Chatainya . There is Ramakrishna . <p> And he had this great insight . Again , that whole Gita thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krishna , right ? So this is a part of that whole vision of the Gita that Ramakrishna connects to . So he 's saying all religions ... we accept all religions as true , not just all Hindu sects . <p> " I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth . I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites who came to south India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny . I am proud to belong to a religion which had sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation . I will quote to you brother in a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood " . <p> Now this is a phrase which so many Indians know . " As the different streams , having their sources in different paths , which men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or straight , all lead to thee . " This is the famous thing . There are many rivers . All rivers lead to the ocean . In the same way , all religions lead to god . This is his basic view . And then he quotes the Gita . <p> " This present convention , which is one of the most august assemblies ever held , is in itself a vindication . " Listen to what he says here . " A decoration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita . " And he quotes the Gita " the text we 've already looked at , though his translation is different than ours . " Whosever comes to me through whatsoever form , I reach him . All men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me . Sectarianism , bigotry and its horrible descendant fanaticism have long possessed this beautiful earth . They have filled the earth with violence , drenched it often and often with human blood , destroyed civilisation and sent whole nations to despair . Had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be far more advanced than it is now . But their time had come and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death knell of all fanaticism , of all persecution with the sword or with the pen , and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal . " <p> This is definitely nineteenth century talk . But he is talking about toleration of all religions as equal . This is what we call pluralism , which is , in fact , really a form of allowing for any path " not political pluralism , but religious pluralism " allowing for any religion to be equally efficacious . <p> On the back , he had an even more spirited final charge on 27 September 1893 . Listen to what he says , going down to the third paragraph . " Much has been said of the common ground of religious unity . I am not going just now to mention my own theory . " Then he goes on to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity will come by the triumph of any of the religions and the destruction of others , I say to him : ' Brothers , yours is an impossible hope ' . " And this is probably the most quoted part of this passage . " Do I wish that the Christian would become Hindu ? God forbid . Do I wish that the Hindu or Buddhist would become Christian ? God forbid . The seed is put in the ground and earth and air and water placed around . Does the seed become the earth or the air or the water ? No . It becomes a plant . It develops after the law of its own growth , assimilates the air , the earth and the water , converts them into plant substance and grows into a plant . Similar is the case with religion . The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist , nor a Hindu or a Buddhist become a Christian . But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown anything to the world it is this . It has proved to the world that holiness , purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world and every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character . In the face of this evidence , if anybody dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion and the destruction of the others , I pity him from the bottom of my heart and point out to him that upon the banner of every religion will soon be written , in spite of resistance , help and not fight , assimilation and not destruction , harmony and peace and not dissension . " <p> Can you imagine it ? This is very , very influential stuff that has affected the way religions are viewed broadly in the West . Prior to this point , the majority of Americans believed that Christianity was the only true religion . All others must be displaced by gospel preaching . Today , it is not , as you know , widely held by rank and file mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelicals that Christianity is somehow or another unique or Christ is normative . And I , in my book , I argue very passionately for the normative , unique nature of the gospel . But I think that we should be aware that this kind of thing is very , very much a part of , I think , the kind of set paradigm now , the default paradigm . <p> OK , thoughts or comments on Vivekananda and his famous series of brief addresses to the Chicago Parliament of Religions ? <p> Question : Were both of these figures , Vivekananda and Ramakrishna , both Brahmins ? <p> Yes . This is very popular thing for certain Brahmins to realise . The heat is coming on us , so let 's popularise our movement . <p> A number of streams came from Vivekananda 's thought . We 'll try to briefly highlight some of these . Because of time , we 're going to have to maybe do this a little quicker than I hoped , because we have a lot more to cover today outside of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that was really brought up and taken up from Vivekananda is this social ethical stream . <p> You find this especially in the work and writings of Ghandi . Because Gandhi is not a Brahmin . Gandhi is not a Brahmin . He 's a Vaishnava . So he 's high caste , but he 's at the third tier . Brahmin , Kshatriya , Vaisya . So he 's a mutra .. He 's a merchant . And he 's from Gujarat . He 's a Gujarati . He 's not from the most , you know , like great earth-shaking places . I mean , everybody that 's anybody in terms of Hindu philosophy comes from either Yupi or Kerala or maybe Tamil Nadu if you count some of the bhakti poets and all that . But when you 're looking at ... Gujarat is not a place that produces like great Indian leaders historically . So , in many ways , Gandhi comes out of the blue . <p> He studies law in London . He 's exposed to this theosophical society , which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all religions together . You may have heard of a woman called Annie Besant . She became a very popular speaker around the world . She was an Irish woman who came to India and argued that India is wonderful and can be the only hope for the world . And she was one of the cofounders of the Indian National Congress and also one of the cofounders of the Banaras Hindu University " a famous university in Varanasi in India . Very powerful woman . My own figure that I studied debated her on several occasions in various public meetings because she was in many ways represented this kind of Western acceptance of Hinduism as the solution to the world 's ills . <p> So Gandhi borrowed something from Jesus I think in the Sermon on the Mount . But he also borrowed a lot from general tendencies in Hinduism at the time " Vivekananda 's idea that perhaps Hinduism could be a uniting force to bring peace to the world . Gandhi does accept that tat twam asi scheme , but it applies it sociologically , not ontologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oneness of god , but the vision is the oneness of humanity . That 's a very different kind of application of it . <p> And he insists that it is not a matter of caste . Again , Gandhi does not seek , as is popularly thought , Gandhi does not seek the abolition of the caste system . This is something you get from the movies about Gandhi , not the actual real Gandhi . Gandhi was extremely insistent that if the caste system is gone , Hinduism is gone . He argued for a reform of the caste system . In fact , you look at the list of terms there . The last term on that list under Gandhi is a term varnashrama-dharma . That refers to ... in fact , you can break it down . Varna " what does varna mean ? <p> Answer : Colours . <p> Colours . Right . That 's referring to the four colours : Brahmin , Kshatriya , Vaisya and Sudra . Ashram is this term for the gathering of people " the gathering of these colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should be a unity among the four varnas and the multitude of castes " jojati a part of the varna system . That will create a societal role where everybody knows their role . So what he would say is : Do n't get rid of the street sweeper , but give the street sweeper dignity . That 's very different from saying let 's bring uplift to the street sweeper . So he renames ... Gandhi 's the one that renames the outcast . He calls them ... or the untouchables , unseeables ... he calls them Harijans , which means ... Well , you know the word hari " means lord or god . Harijan means children or those who belong to god , children of god , harijan . <p> So this today has been rejected . The dalits hate this expression today because they think it 's paternalistic , you know : O yeah , you 're the children of god and we 'll take care of you . But at the time this was considered to be like a big breakthrough that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god . <p> So Gandhi tried to bring together a number of social issues ... I 've not list these as terms you need to know , but he called the heart of his message , what he called satyagraha , soul force . Non-violence " ahimsa " very important Jain doctrine he brings into his ethic . The welfare of the community . And this is a little known part of his writings , but brahmacarya " the idea of Brahmins and people maintaining chastity in order to keep down population explosion which was a concern at that time , early twentieth century . <p> So Gandhi , which I 'm assuming you may be aware of already to some degree " we wo n't have time in this class to develop his life in a more holistic way . But as you know , Gandhi is the one that is considered the father of the nation . If you pluck out bills from India , the rupees , many of them have Gandhi 's picture on them . There are ... almost every village or town will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , we 've got a nice little park there on Rajpur Road , Gandhi Park , and people go there with their children and all and it has a big statue of Gandhi there . This is very typical . All over India you 'll see various pictures of Gandhi . <p> There 's a very powerful statue in Delhi that shows Gandhi on the salt march . The salt march is the very famous rebellion of Gandhi against the British and he 's trying to again say : India can look after itself . We can make our own salt . We do n't have to import it . So he goes to the sea to make salt because the British , at that point , outlawed the Indians from making salt . So they go to the ... he has this march to the sea to make salt as in great defiance of the British . And so he wears his what 's called a doti . It 's like just a simple one cloth that he wraps around him here and he has , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I may have ... yeah , he 's wearing this " this outfit here , with his famous stick and he 's making his way to the sea . <p> And in this statue in Delhi , you have a picture of Gandhi marching along and behind him they have very , very powerfully ... and this is a huge thing . I mean , Gandhi himself must be twenty feet high . So it has a kind of larger than life impression when you see it . But hey have carved in these statues the faces of all over of all India . You have various low caste people . You have high caste . You 've got figures that are ... they have a Christian priest there " a guy with a cross around his neck from the south Indian church , the Mar Thoma church . They 've got a Sikh man there with a turban . They have all the ways you 'd recognise that Gandhi was leading the whole nation to some great national unity . So it 's a statue symbolising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole strive for 1947 declaration of independence which took place and finally was occurred . And India , of course , now is the largest democracy in the world . <p> Comments or thoughts about Gandhi that you might like to make ? Yes . <p> Question : ? ? ? accurate ? ? ? <p> It 's horribly inaccurate . Yeah . It really is . It 's a Hollywood version . It was actually done in cooperation with the Indian Tourist Board , not the Indian Historical Society . So it was done as a way to attract people to come to India . So really downplays many of Gandhi 's more controversial parts of his life . There are many ... I mean , virtually a lot of things about it were true . It 's not so much they were propagating lies , but it 's what they left out " just the very careful way they treated Gandhi , especially his attitude toward caste . I loved it . I enjoyed the movie . But it 's just a movie . It 's like watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't actually happen that way . So you just enjoy it as a movie . Unfortunately , most people today get their history from these movies and so it 's a little bit of a problem . OK , other thoughts or comments ? <p> Question : Is Gandhi ? ? ? his stuff published ? <p> It is . His probably most widely-published book is his one called My Experiment with Truth which has never been out of print since he published it . But you also have The Collected Works of Gandhi which are found ... almost any bookshop would have them . I mean , like a Barnes and Noble type bookshop . You can go on the internet and pick them up . So his writings are available and certainly there have been many , many thousands of books written about him and his writings and his teachings that he taught in his ashram . <p> Question : You 're saying though that there 's a ? ? ? <p> Varnashrama-dharma . <p> Question : You 're saying that 's rejected now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the caste system but an abolition of it . And so they 're saying the whole varnashrama-dharma conception is reinforcing the fact that caste and varna is part of the created order . See Gandhi never rejected that basic notion of the Rig-Veda " mandala 1090 " that people were created differently for different tasks . He does n't ever object to that . The dalits want to say no . I mean , the fact is , right in Dehradun as well ? ? ? contradictions you have a picture of the most famous dalit of modern times " the one who is the founder of the Indian constitution was written by a dalit by an outcast . And I think in some ways the tension between Ambedkar , who is this dalit , Ambedkar and Gandhi is a very powerful symbol of India 's tension . Because Gandhi represents a purified Hinduism that interacts with the world as Hinduism . <p> I mean , you ca n't miss the fact that what Vivekananda is actually arguing for is that Hinduism swallow everything else up . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hinduism , Islam , Christianity , Buddhism ... if Islam and Christianity say : You 're right , we 're all one of many paths , that 's Hinduism . So in many ways it 's a very clever thing . <p> So Gandhi is actually arguing for the sustenance of Hinduism as a global unified force . He argues that Hitler could have been defeated through massive non-resistance , for example . We did not need to go to war against Hitler . Things like that . Trying to extend the Hindu vision to solve all social problems in the world . Whereas Ambedkar , who grew up as a dalit , said : I was born a Hindu , I 'm not going to die a Hindu . And he led the whole charge against this to say : What would India look like if we were truly a secular , political establishment that allowed for freedom of religion . This is kind of the Western democratic idea . And that tension is very much in ... India today is still torn between these two ideals . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this going to be a secular country that allows for religious pluralism ? <p> Which actually brings me to the next point , which is the RSS Movement founded in 1925 with about 20 men . Again , the goal of it is to unite and liberate India and they do the most remarkable thing by tying bhakti movements into nationalism . Now , the amazing thing today , if you go to India today , you would think that it was always this way . I mean , my experience in India " I am now in my sixteenth year working in India " I never experienced a bhakti movement that is not tied into nationalism . To me , it 's the way it 's always been . But this is actually something that starts in the twentieth century . So the idea of making , for example , especially the goddess figure " Kali , Durga , Ma , the major expressions of Devi " to make the goddess figures symbols of India , which equals Indian nationalism , is a very strong motif that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the three Hs : Hindu religion , the Hindi language , and renaming the country Hindustan , the land of the Hindus . They are extremely , extremely opposed to a secular vision that would allow for other religious expressions . They even view Gandhi , forget about Ambedkar , they view Gandhi as going way over the line . In fact , on February 4 , 1948 , the RSS assassinated Gandhi . So Gandhi was assassinated by RSS . He 's put to death because of him accepting the fact that Islam and Hinduism both had a place in India , you know , united India . The RSS was banned five days after Gandhi 's assassination , but was brought back in July 1949 after a number of negotiations a little over a year later . <p> And RSS is very , very active today , believe me . We face this every turn that we make in north India . Every village we go to has RSS chapters . They have burned missionaries . Graham Staines was burned by RSS people in Orissa State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a number of our church planters , Jeff and Lou Ann may know ... Do you know Aidisuna ? Or Lemawapatanayit ? Did you ever meet them when they were there ? Anyway , these were people who graduated years ago " maybe fifteen years ago " but they are major regional leaders in Orissa State . Both of them are on RSS hit list , which means if they 're ever found out alone , they can be killed . Frankly , even though it 's against the law to do this . This is definitely against the law , but the local magistrates will look to the direction . <p> So , the RSS , what 's happened is , until the early 90s , the Congress Power , the Congress Party , ruled India . Congress was the party of the Gandhi family " had a vision for a secular India , politically allowing for religious pluralism . The Congress Party fell out of power after Rao was caught with corruption . And now the party , ever since , has been the BJP Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , because it 's a fractuous party , they 'd had to align themselves with various movements . <p> This is ... remember the Indian political situation is like the British system . It is n't like America where you can have a divided government between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch " have Democrats in the White House and Republicans in the Congress . You ... this is not the way it 's done in Britain or here . The party in power produces the Prime Minister . If you do n't have the power of the party behind you , you fall out of power . You have to elect a new Prime Minister . <p> So the BJP Party wants to stay in power . In order to do that they 've aligned themselves with several groups " the most important is the VHP . And these are probably all just letters to you , but they 're very important in India . You have the Congress Party which is the party in power for most of the time from 47 until more recently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People 's Party " the People 's Party of India . And then you have " they have aligned themselves with the VHP which is another nationalistic movement which is essentially the political arm of RSS . It 's like in Northern Ireland how you have the Sinn Fein . It 's just like Sinn Fein is for the IRA . IRA is not technically a political party , but they have their political wing through Sinn Fein . In the same way , VHP is the political expression of RSS . So if BJP does not have an alliance with VHP , they can not stay in power . They 'll go out of power today . So in order to stay in power , they have pressure from VHP to overlook some of the excesses of RSS . <p> And that 's what we face in the last especially in the last eight years , we 've experienced , especially in north India , innumerable problems with this . And it 's not just ... I mean , it happens on various levels . It happened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dominant level , where you want to purchase land . Absolutely no ... no way . You just ca n't purchase land . There 's just no ... they will never give you a permit because you 're a Christian . The Congress never had that attitude . This is a RSS thing . You want to get a telephone . You ca n't get a telephone because you have to go through paperwork and they just ... it 'll never make it to the top of the stack . There 's kind of low-level problems . <p> And then it gets all the way to certain parts of India , particularly in certain parts of Madhya Pradesh and parts of Gujarat and Bihar and Orissa " those places especially " where just flat out they 'll burn your church down at night . They will make threats against you . Because the Indian constitution says that you have the right to follow any religion you want . So according to the Indian constitution you can be a Christian . But the problem is they say " what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to be a Christian in India , but you have to be born one . You can not become one . " That 's their position . If you become a Christian , that 's against the law . You can not be ? ? ? ... they have laws across India , anti-conversion laws , which have been upheld by lower courts . It 's still being considered by the Supreme Court whether this is legal or not . But right now , we operate in many states where it is against the law to baptise somebody " even though it 's not against the law to be a Christian . You just ca n't become one . <p> Well , that obviously is a huge important distinction because if you can not become one , then it simply reduces Christianity to propagated through families that are currently Christians " like the Malayalis in Kerala , wherever " Christian families in Tamil Nadu . But in the case in north India , where you have very few Christians , we have to rely upon a vigorous church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's what they 're opposing . <p> OK , thoughts or comments about RSS or any other political realities of modern India ? Yeah . <p> Question : What are the Hs again ? <p> The three Hs are Hindu , meaning Hindu religion . Hindi " they want the whole language of India to be Hindi . Right now , Hindi is the national language ; English is the official language . So , in language in like dealing with foreign governments and all they speak English . Education is in English . But it 's the heart language of India . But if you go to the south India , do n't tell a Tamil Nadu he should learn Hindi . Those are fighting words . And in places like Kerala , Sigmulialum , you know , in Karnataka they speak Kannada . In the south you have this whole just range of languages , Telugu and other languages . They want to diminish the role of regional languages and make Hindi the language of the whole country because they 're ... see they 're powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirdly is they want to rename India Hindustan . They do n't like the term Bharat , because Bharat is a term which for them does not signify the Hinduness of India . Part of this actually is part of a larger scheme , because once you say Hindustan you have to acknowledge that the Indus River belongs to India because the word Hindu comes from Indus River . Where does the Indus River lie ? <p> Answer : Pakistan . <p> Pakistan . So , this is actually part of a larger concern to re-unite the entire sub-continent , which would include Bangladesh and Pakistan under an Indian flag . You can imagine the amount of bloodshed if you 're talking about forcing the Moslems to abandon Islam and become Hindus . So there is a lot of potential danger to this thing . <p> But even apart from that , within India itself , if you 're a Christian and I 'll be honest with you . If you look historically at the RSS , despite what we 've experienced as Christians in north India , we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise God they have not given us the treatment they have given the Moslems . " The Moslems have suffered far worse than the Christians . More Moslems have been put to death than Christians . More Moslems have been burned to death than the Christians have . More Moslem mosques have been destroyed than Christian churches . So this is not just an anti-Christian thing . This is anybody who 's not Hindu and the Moslems have suffered horribly through this . <p> And one of the things that the RSS are saying they have , in Hindi , the translation in the English goes like this : Today the Moslems , tomorrow the Christians . So right now , we 're focused on the Moslems . But we 're going , in time , we 're going to focus fully on the Christians . And one of the things that we noticed in recent years is a shift toward more direct Christian response because the Moslems fight back , as we all know . The Christians have been much more docile . And therefore they think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about RSS ? Yes . <p> Question : On the anti-conversion laws , are people who are born Christian are ? ? ? <p> The advantage that people who are born in Christian families have is that they have the constitution so clearly by their side and Supreme Court rulings from the High Court . It 's also been upheld in the ... what 's called the Rajya Sabha , the lower house and upper house of their congress . So , it 's just very difficult legally to attack . They still find ways , but I 'd say the main thing they 're trying to stop is conversions , because they claim that Christians are paying people to convert . And that is against the law in India , for any group " even Hindus to do that . <p> So they 're claiming that people are ... and I told you , I think , before when Adisunow I was just with him a few weeks ago in India . And he told me ... We were talking about this whole thing actually and the problems he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning by the police who are RSS . And they said to him : " You had these meetings and we have records of all those who have been converted . " He said : " I did n't convert anybody . " He said : " All we do is preach the gospel . We just preached what God has done through Jesus Christ . God converted them . " He said : " If you do n't like that , go arrest God . " <p> Now , I promise you , a foreigner could not say that . Only because he is from Orissa , born and raised there ... If a foreigner said that , I guarantee you 'd be killed or put in gaol . I made a reference one night in Orissa , just preaching in a service . I happened to make the reference that ... this is when Rajiv Gandhi was president . This is even before BJP came to power , when things were much more , you know ... I made a reference to how would if feel if Rajiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sense of electricity in the room because , you know , the Prime Minister walked in . It would be like if you said what would happen if right now George Bush would walk in here . People would : Wow , George Bush is here . And so I said : How much more so if the presence of Jesus is here . So I contrasted the political presence of Rajiv Gandhi with the spiritual presence of Jesus . <p> Well , when I got through ? ? ? these policemen came up to me and said I had to go in for interrogation . And it was n't like ... I should n't say interrogation , that 's not right . That 's like , you think of like Saddam Hussein whipping somebody . I mean , they took me aside for questioning . And they basically said : " What did you mean by that ? What were you trying to say ? " And I assured them I was deeply in love with the Congress Party . Rajiv Gandhi was one of my fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da . I was just simply contrasting the political realities with the ... you know , I just told them what it really meant . And they said : " OK , that 's fine . Go ahead , Be careful . Do n't make any political references in your sermons . " That would n't have happened in Delhi or ? ? ? but down in Orissa " things like that . They 're very sensitive to political things . <p> When ... Jeff , you went to Bhopal as well , right ? And you 've been there . You all stayed in GK Palace Hotel , right ? The reason that they stayed in the hotel there " and that 's the reason I stay in the hotel when I go there " is because if you stay in a home in India ... if you stay anywhere in India , if you 're a foreigner , you 've got to register with the government wherever you go . There 's forms you fill out to say where you are , what you 're doing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our host down there , he has to answer to the police . Why were these Christians there ? What are they doing ? It just creates a big hassle for him . So a hotel is , of course , a neutral place to stay . So sometimes it 's actually advantageous , especially in places like Orissa , Madhya Pradesh and Bihar , especially those three places , to stay in hotels because you can actually create problems for your Indian guest . This would n't be a problem in south India nearly as much , but north , you definitely have some of these problems . <p> Let 's say a few things about the Hare Krishna movement . We 've already looked at all this with Sai Baba . The Hare Krishna movement is another stream from all of this , where we have examples of Hinduism being exported to the Western world . It 's another guru based movement . And it is a movement which has tried to rethink Hinduism for Western people . <p> The man that you see before you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that you know these words , you can appreciate all of this . Bhaktivedanta . So you see this ? The union of these two " the Vedanta , which is clearly jnana marga , with the word bhakti . So this is his swami name : Bhaktivedanta . Swami which means teacher . Prabhupada " one who steps , leads you into enlightenment . This figure is the founder of what we now know today as the International Society of Krishna Consciousness . It 's a relatively small movement in India compared to around the world . But because people have seen this , it 's important that I at least make reference to it here . <p> It is believed that he is a reincarnation of Chaitanya . I mentioned this figure ... this is a famous teacher in the Middle Ages that people believe is a reincarnation of Krishna . And so he is believed to be another incarnation , great teacher . Back in , especially in the 60s , he came to New York " in 65 . The hippies gathered around him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , my father had a business in downtown Atlanta . And we used to walk down to the park every ... at this same time period when the guru that you followed was making his rounds around the ... Guru Marahaji movement . But the Hare Krishna movement was very strong in Atlanta . And so we used to eat lunch in Central City Park , Atlanta , and watch the Hare Krishna people dance and they would hand out literature and all this . And a lot of the people ... we would see hippies that would be watching them one week and then next week you 'd see them there , you know , with their shaved heads with the little ponytail and they were " Hare , Hare , Hare , Krishna , Krishna , Hare , Hare , Hare . " They were doing the ... it was just something ... we could see the whole process of someone being an enquirer all the way to being a full disciple in the saffron robe . It 's a quite a remarkable movement that 's attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Gita alone , Krishna alone . It 's like , you know : sola scriptura , solus Christus , sola fide . The Gita alone , Krishna alone . And the idea is that Krishna consciousness is superior to all other religions . So this is a very different kind of thing than kind of what we saw with Vivekananda saying all religions are equal paths . We 're not going to convert you . This is a strong : We want to bring you into our movement . <p> I mean , I debated an ISHCON man right on Gordon College campus last year . He was trying to convince us of the truth of ISHCON . He was not at all saying : " O yeah , you Christians stay a Christian ; Buddhists stay Buddhists . " He was n't that way . This is a very evangelistic kind of movement . <p> They argue that in classic ability to join together various margas that they accept the Brahminical scheme about Brahman and tat twam asi . They accept that . But they say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal consciousness . He is not impersonal . He is not nirguna Brahman . That Brahman has a personality and that personality is Krishna . So they equate Krishna with Brahman . Their scheme is ... rather than having Brahman as nirguna and saguna and all the many expressions which , according to the Vedantic scheme , if you remember , at the level of saguna you have all kinds of illusory expressions of Isvara . OK , so Isvara is the personal name of the creator god and Isvara has manifested himself in many ways , including , for example , in Vishnu , which has in turn has various incarnations , one of which is Krishna . OK . So this is kind of you standard bhaktism about Krishna , with the gopis and all of that . We 've looked at in the previous lectures . But the ISHCON movement does not accept this . This is not ISHCON . They 're saying that this is wrong . All of this is a reflection and point upward to Brahman who is known as Krishna . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very devoted group that accepts the overall framework within saguna . So that makes this movement particularly interesting because it 's a different kind of movement than we 've seen in the past . <p> Question : So would they still section off nirguna and saguna ... ? <p> No . They deny the nirguna Brahman . They deny that distinction which is a particular feature of Advaitism . It is not even a particular feature of Vedantism , we 'll see later . So the idea of denying the nirguna/saguna is not a particular problem philosophically , because many people do n't accept that distinction . That 's a Sankara thing . <p> Question : If Krishna then has beginning and end , I do n't understand like how Krishna has all of a sudden become nirguna Brahman ? <p> Not nirguna Brahman but Brahman . <p> Comment : Just Brahman . <p> Yeah , Brahman . Right . But you 're right . Conceptually , you 're right . Nirguna Brahman . Well , because there they believe that the historical manifestations of Krishna , the avatars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godhead . So it would be like saying " I mean , this is a horrible exam ... parallel , but just to make it clear " they will : " Well Jesus was born . Jesus died . Why do n't you accept the fact that Krishna can be born and died ? " And yet we acknowledge that beyond that , transcendentally beyond that , Jesus is eternal . So they 're acknowledging that Krishna is eternal . They do n't necessarily deny that they 're having an incarnation of Vishnu in Krishna . They do n't deny that . They just believe that those are merely reflections of this great reality " that god can be known . <p> See , part of this is showing the Hindu longing for a personal god . This is really what lies at the root of this " the desire to say : All the advaitic vedantism can give us is a god who can not be known . And now you have a god who can be known . That 's a very powerful thing . <p> And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the chant that they say when they 're playing their damarus and their little cymbals , they 'll say : " Hare Krishna , Hare Krishna , Krishna , Krishna , Hare , Hare , Hare Rama , Hare Rama , Rama , Rama , Hare , Hare . " They believe if you say that , you 'll be liberated and saved . I 've asked on several occasions people who follow this : " How can saying that save you ? " Now , their answer is usually along the lines of this is what gets you into the transcendental presence of Krishna . This is what liberates you into the consciousness of the OM . So they do n't believe that the unstruck sound , the OM that we looked at earlier in the course , is an impersonal force sound . It is a personality resonance of Krishna . Every ... all these transcendental themes are reinterpreted as Krishna , personally as Krishna . So they believe that this somehow gets you in touch with this personal personality of godhead . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it become more possible to do , to debate or do apologetics therefore in a Western fashion ? Is this sort of structure changed significantly or is this not the case ? <p> Well , I think it 's a good point , a good question . I 'm not sure I know the answer to it . I will say that it changes the methodology of what you approach . I have ... I only have a kind of a limited view of the role of apologetics anyway , even though I wrote a book on apologetics . I see it in a very limited role , as a part of a much larger strategy of what we do with Hindus . So I do n't really view that as like is ... just read this book and go out " you should be properly prepared to do everything . I wish I could do something like that , but this is just like one little small part of the puzzle . <p> But I think the ... it is true , that one of the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can talk about ontology " which is a very important point in any ... you , know because that 's the point you can either talk about or not . I mean , that 's not something that 's allusive . Like , you know , a Buddhist does n't have an ontology . At least they have an ontology and it can be spoken of . So you 're not lost this abyss of nirguna . <p> In some ways , I 've found it to be very helpful and I mentioned , I think , before , last time how I pressed the guy on the ... because he ... they really argue for a lot on the distinction between the worshipper and Krishna . But they do n't believe ontologically that there 's any ultimate distinction . That 's a huge difference between Christianity and all Hinduism , but especially ISHCON . We believe that we are wholly other . God is wholly other than we are . He 's uncreated . We are always created . We are sustained by His existence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't change anything . If God ceases to exist , we have no existence . So ontologically we are tethered to God in a way He 's not tethered to us . They have the worshipper and the one who is worshipped fully tethered one to another . And that , to me , is a fundamental flaw in their ontology . <p> That will obviously help if you stopped and talked to this fellow right here . You know , because he may not have ever thought about that or care about it . All he knows is he was very lonely . Maybe he took drugs and he was searching and he found a family . And this family cared for him . And that 's the level they think about this . You know , I ... now I have a meaning now . I have a belonging . I have a group . I do find more peace than I had before . So , at that level , that 's one thing . <p> But I was talking to a guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debates people , so , you know , I expected him to be more aware than he was . <p> So , apologetics is a matter of many different levels " what works and what needs to be done . Apologetics is partly for us , actually " for us to have the confidence to realise the coherence of the Christian worldview . And it gives us the courage to tell Vivekananda : No , all religions are not all the same . And I think that 's the more value I see in like the book I wrote and other books like this . <p> OK . Finally , we 're not going to get to the festivals . We 'll do that next time , but time always flies . We just real quick . Another figure that I think represents part of this meditative/devotional stream " though now we 're moving away from Hinduism " we 're getting into the borders of other movements " is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , the founder of Transcendental Meditation . There 's no question that he is another example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the Hare Krishna movement , Vivekananda and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as examples of how the Western world today encounters Hinduism . We encounter it through the pluralism of Vivekananda , which I think has infected our society very profoundly . We encounter it through this kind of idea of the material West and the spiritual East idea which is in Hare Krishna , that , you know , I was once materialistic , now I 'm spiritual . This is a huge myth about India , that India is a spiritual place and not very materialistic . But this is widely propagated in the West and this has affected how people view India , how they view Hinduism.

@@35723496 @4723496/ <h> Christology in the Synoptics : What Jesus Taught about Himself <p> We have looked at the centrality of the theme of the kingdom for the teaching of Jesus . Then we proceeded to the ethical outworking of Jesus ' announcement of the kingdom 's arrival . It now becomes appropriate ( still focusing exclusively on the synoptic gospels : Matthew , Mark and Luke ) to ask the question : What kind of person was Jesus " including what He thought about Himself ? This is the question of Christology . Who but the King Himself would announce the kingdom in the way that Jesus did ? Who but divine Messiah would reinterpret the eternal law of God for the ethical mandates that Jesus gave ? <h> I. The Nature of Jesus ' Death <p> Or , to ask the question the way many recent scholars in the so-called Quest of the Historical Jesus ( that is , functioning simply as historians , whether or not they also share Christian faith ) have been asking the question : What was it that got Jesus crucified ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians of all ideologies have to come to grips with is the nature of Jesus ' death . And many , particularly quite liberal scholars ( particularly those represented in the famous Jesus Seminar ) , prove the weakest at precisely this point . If Jesus were nothing other than a good rabbi , a wise sage , a human teacher ( encouraging people to love one another and God , illustrating this principle from the world of nature and ordinary human interaction as in the parables ) , there is very little likelihood that He would ever have been arrested and executed with the agonizing form of capital punishment reserved for criminals or slaves . <h> a . Jesus Clearing the Temple <p> In the synoptic gospels , it is the role of Jesus clearing the temple ( see Mark 11 and parallels ) , which the gospel writers point out as the final climatic incident that confirmed in the minds of the Jewish authorities the need to put Him to death . And not surprisingly , He was calling for far more than reform from corrupt practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong that the temple had to be cleared of its current sacrificial practices so that things could begin again . <h> b . Jesus ' Claims that He is God <p> But this is merely the climactic incident in the synoptic presentation . As N.T.Wright has done so nicely in one portion of his book , Jesus and the Victory of God , one can move backwards from His trial before the Sanhedrin ( the Jewish high court ) , all the way to His baptism at the beginning of His public life . Throughout , one see provocative claims that , when rightly understood , meant that Jesus was explicitly or implicitly claiming messianic authority and often divine messianic authority of the kind that would ultimately lead to His charge of blasphemy against God and conviction under the Jewish law . <p> We begin then with His confession before the Sanhedrin in Mark 14:62 ( and parallels ) . Jesus is asked directly if He is the Christ , the Messiah , the Son of God . And at least in Mark , His answer is clear enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke have vaguer parallels to the effect of " you say that I am . " This is a more veiled affirmative , which was equivalent to " that is your way of putting it , though not necessarily Mine . " As we have already seen , there was considerable expectation of a militaristic or nationalistic regal kingly Messiah who would overthrow the Romans . This , of course , is not how Jesus understands His mission on this occasion . <p> But He goes on to say , in all of the synoptic accounts , that the high court would see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven . This is an allusion to Daniel 7 and the human being who approached the Ancient of Days ( the name or title for God ) and was given universal dominion over the peoples of the earth . Not surprisingly , the implied divinity in such a claim leads the high priest to tear his robes as a sign that Jesus has committed blasphemy . <p> But how did we get to this climactic stage ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple and using the parable of the wicked tenants ( see Mark 12:1 and following and parallels ) . He taught that the kingdom would be given to a nation producing the fruits " a people group ( that is to say , those who were His followers ) , Jew or Gentile . This was not the current Jewish leadership , which had forfeited its right to rule through its disobedience and failing to truly serve God . <p> That same day of Jesus ' final teaching in the temple , He stymies the Jewish leaders and marvels the crowd with His appeal to Psalm 110:1 . In this , David declared : " The Lord says to my Lord : ' Sit at My right hand while I make your enemies your foot stool ' . " Who is this second Lord , besides Yahweh the God of Israel , who is above even the king of Israel if not the Messiah ? <p> Thus , as we move backward to the beginning of the week , now known as Passion Week that would culminate in Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sandwiched around it in Mark 11 the at-first glance puzzling episode of the withered fig tree . This is particularly striking in Mark 's account . Mark goes out of his way to say it was not the season for figs , which is surely a way to stress the symbolic value of this account . It is not that Jesus is simply upset with the tree that should have provided breakfast for Him and perhaps His disciples . But given that fig trees in bloom and at harvest-time were regularly a sign or symbol in the Old Testament of Israel living in peace and prosperity in her land , a barren fig tree becomes a natural symbol for the current Israelite regime being under God 's judgment . <p> All of these various factors of Passion Week then combine to create a significant measure of hostility between Jesus and the prevailing Jewish leadership of His day . <h> c . Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem ( Palm Sunday ) <p> But there is more . What we today celebrate on Palm Sunday and sometimes call the triumphal entry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) might better be called His non-triumphal entry . For He comes not as a conqueror on a white horse ( as indeed He will in Revelation 19 at the end of time ) , but on this occasion as one riding a humble beast of burden , the donkey . This is still in fulfillment of the messianic prophecy ( see Zechariah 9:9 ) , but whose humble manner is not captured by the crowds who acclaim Him as the coming King . Little wonder their discouragement and disillusionment with Him a scant five days later when at least some of the same individuals are calling for His crucifixion . <p> But continue moving backwards through the final months of His ministry and we read in the synoptics that Jesus three times predicts His coming passion , His death and resurrection . The first of these comes toward the end of Mark 8 , on the heels of Peter 's confession of Jesus as the Christ . This confession is significantly elaborated in Matthew 's account in Matthew 16 , so that Jesus praises him as having received supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel accounts of this confession is that Peter remains unprepared for a suffering Messiah . So when Jesus begins to predict His passion , Peter sharply rebukes Him . And Jesus has to reply in kind . Nevertheless , there is a recognition by those following Jesus that He is a Messiah . <h> e . Jesus Teaches about His Kingship in Parables <p> Still earlier , we recall Jesus ' teaching in parables and working miracles throughout the bulk of His public ministry . The heart of each is to focus attention on the arrival of the kingdom which means the arrival of the King . So to the inaugural sermon from early in Jesus ' ministry at the Nazareth synagogue ( in Luke 4:16 and following ) . This describes Him quoting what we know as Isaiah 61:1-2a , in which the prophetic ministry of a Spirit-anointed spokesman is highlighted . But again , this is not one who will triumph in the world 's sense on this occasion , but one who has come to proclaim liberty for captives and good news to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dispossessed and stigmatized society of His day . <h> f . Jesus ' Baptism <p> Finally we arrive , in our backward march , all the way at Jesus ' baptism in Mark 1 ( and parallels ) . This is at the very beginning of His public ministry , where the voice from heaven alludes to excerpts from the Messianic Psalm 2:7 and the Suffering Servant passage Isaiah 42:1 . The voice conjoins these very two offices into the one person of Jesus , who is both My beloved Son and also the One to whom all obedience should be given . <p> None of these passages come out and affirm Jesus ' divine messiahship as clearly as many texts in the gospel of John ( to which we shall turn in a later lecture ) . But the very fact that they represent what has been called a more implicit than explicit Christology makes them , from the historian 's point of view , all the more likely to be historical , or authentic . This makes the more explicit Christology , still to be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of Jesus ' relationships <p> Indeed , we may add to our list still other examples of Jesus ' implicit Christology from the synoptics . The nature of His relationships , for example , including with John the Baptist . We have already seen in a previous lecture in Matthew 11:11-12 , He pronounces that the least in the kingdom is greater than John . But who is it who can objectively pronounce on who is greater than the greatest prophet of all time to date , unless one who is greater still ? <p> Or , as He preached in the Sermon on the Mount ( as we saw in the lecture concerning the ethics of the kingdom ) , the sermon concludes with the people marveling that His authority was greater than that of the Jewish leaders . How so ? They claimed a remarkable authority . And yet it was always based on being able to cite a Scripture to back up their claims or a previous authoritative rabbi who agreed with them . Jesus rarely took the former tack ( more often quoting the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never followed the latter procedure . Who , in a first century Jewish context , had the right to simply sovereignly pronounce on how God 's immutable law should be taken ? <p> Or again , in places such as Matthew 19:28 where He speaks of His twelve followers constituting the judges or kings who would reign on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel . If He is not the Messiah constituting the nucleus of the new , true or freed Israel , then who can make such claims ? <h> III . Instances in which Jesus Accepts Worship , Prayer and Faith <p> Or consider still further those contexts , such as in Mark 2 with the healing of the paralytic , or Matthew 14 after the stilling of the storm , in which He accepts worship , prayer or faith . This happens after the healings of Jairus ' daughter and the woman with the flow of blood . <h> IV . Jesus Acts as God 's Agent for Final Judgment <p> Consider the ways in which He acts as God 's ultimate agent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider His claiming His own authority to forgive sins , such as at the healing of the paralytic or to the thief on the cross in Luke 23:43 . <h> V. Metaphors Applied to Yahweh are also Applied to Jesus <p> Note how numerous metaphors applied to Yahweh ( God of Israel ) in the Old Testament are applied to Jesus . Often this is in His own teaching , particularly in parables in the synoptic gospels . These metaphors including that Jesus is the Bridegroom , the Rock , the Lord of the harvest , the Good Shepherd , the Sower , the vineyard Owner and the One who receives the praise even of children ( compare Matthew 21:16 with Psalm 8 ) . <p> Think again of the way in which the unique , intimate sonship between Jesus and His Father is described by that remarkable Aramaic word " Abba " . This is preserved in Greek transliteration in Mark 14:32 and is probably behind most , if not all , the other uses of Father " even when translated into the Greek pat- " r in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other Jewish literature for a mere human addressing God . It reflects the intimacy that one might use of speaking of one 's earthly father in the language of " daddy " or something very close to that . <h> VII . " Truly I say to you , ... " <p> Think too of the numerous places throughout the gospels where a saying of Jesus is prefaced with the solemn announcement " Truly I say to you . " This uses the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word " Amen " - meaning truly , verily , or this is most certainly the case . This is a very distinctive and characteristic form of Jesus ' address , stressing His sovereign authority ( or at least His claim to such ) , including in context in which He claims to critique the law or its current interpretation . <h> VIII . Jesus Talks about " Being Sent " <p> And then there are those various places where He speaks of having been sent , sometimes explicitly by the Father . This suggests some form of other-worldly origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that Jesus made claims and/or was understood to be making claims that transgress the boundary that Jews understood to lie between humanity and deity and therefore led to His arrest and crucifixion . <h> IX . The Meaning of Jesus ' Death <p> What then , from the perspective of His followers , was the meaning of this death , if not the deserved condemnation for blasphemy ? They appealed again particularly to two of Jesus ' own teachings . First , in the context of one of those passion predictions ( particularly in Mark 10:45 and parallels ) , Jesus stresses that , as the Son of Man , He came to serve , not to be served and to give His life a ransom ( the price paid to buy a slave 's freedom ) for many . Jesus understood Himself as one who was substituting for enslaved human beings , paying the price that would liberate them from their slavery to sin . <p> And this substitutionary language appears again the last night of His life at the Last Supper , when He takes the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood given and shed for many , establishing a new covenant with His people . All of this hints at what the disciples would come to recognize within the generation after His death and resurrection as superseding the need for the Jewish sacrificial system . As the book of Hebrews would put so clearly , and in so much detail , Jesus becomes the once-for-all sacrifice for human sin as a representative human , as a substitutionary atoning sacrifice . And as the One who , because He was also fully God , could once for all eternity satisfy the need for sin to be dealt with a way that temporary animal sacrifices never could . <p> How did a crucified would-be Messiah come to be viewed in such terms , since Deuteronomy 21:23 clearly declared that cursed was anyone who is hanged on a tree ? And already by Jesus ' day , rabbinic interpretation had understood the horrors of Roman crucifixion ( death with one 's hands nailed outstretched to a crossbeam of wood similar to the shape of a tree with two branches ) to apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jesus ' Resurrection <p> How did Jesus ' followers come to view a crucified Messiah as one who in fact was divinely vindicated " cursed to be sure , but not for His sins , but for the sins of the world unless there was a genuine resurrection that took place ? And there are numerous other arguments we could add for the credibility of Jesus ' resurrection but , in a survey of the theology of the gospels , the more appropriate direction in which to turn at this point is to observe that such a resurrection likewise vindicated the more explicit pre-Easter gospel claims for Jesus ' divine Messiahship in the synoptic gospels . <h> XI . Messianic Titles used when Referring to Jesus <p> This is particularly so with those claims that attach themselves to the most common titles used for Jesus . By far , the most common are the following four : Son of Man , Son of God ( or Son just by itself ) , Lord and Christ ( or Messiah ) . <p> As already mentioned , the key background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts in the synoptic gospels clearly allude to this . Scholars have regularly divided the Son of Man sayings into three categories . First there are those in which it could be that Jesus is simply referring to Himself or to a representative human or to some person in His position ( such as His famous teaching that foxes have holes and birds of the air have their nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head ) . But if Daniel 7 is at least at one remove in the background , such texts take on that much more poignancy , that one who was even a divine Messiah should find Himself in so ignominious a position . Then secondly , there are the Son of Man texts that predict His suffering and death redefining , as it were , the Messiah by means of the Suffering Servant passages of the Old Testament ( particularly in Isaiah , and particularly Isaiah 52-53 ) . And then thirdly , there are those more exalted references such as we have already seen at Jesus ' confession before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Son of Man for Jesus is a much more exalted title than appears at first blush . It is , in fact , in many contexts more of an equivalent to than a contrast with the title Son of God to which we turn next . <p> Son of God , or Son absolutely , in various contexts often does refer to Jesus ' unique role with His heavenly Father ( as we have already seen in such passages as Matthew 14:33 ) . But in other contexts , particularly early in Jesus ' career " as we now know more clearly than ever from a document discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls " Son of God in Judaism was often simply a synonym for Messiah . It did not always carry overtones of divinity . But as Jesus ' ministry unfolded through His implicit and explicit claims , it comes more and more to verge on this added significance . <p> Then , of course , there is Lord , a term which , in both Testaments and both Hebrew and Greek , could be a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was used in the Middle Ages when there were lords and ladies in European culture . But it was also regularly used to translate the divine consonants not used with vowels in the oldest manuscripts of the Old Testament ( but accepted by scholars today as probably to be pronounced as Yahweh ) : God of Israel Himself . Thus , not every person who falls down before Jesus , say requesting healing in the synoptic gospels , and addressing Him as Lord , necessarily means anything more than master . But in those contexts where Jesus cites the Old Testament , particularly the quotation of Psalm 110 alluded to earlier and elsewhere , there probably is a stronger overtone beginning to move in the direction of divinity . <p> Finally , Christ or Messiah . The Anointed One , as we have already seen , had a very multifaceted background . Especially in intertestimental Jewish works like the Psalms of Solomon , it was viewed as primarily a militaristic liberator from Israel 's human enemies . But Jesus increasingly qualifies this through all of the other titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Himself . So it is only on His second coming , at His return at some unspecified future date , when He will take on this role . First He comes to suffer for the sins of humanity . <h> XII . How could Monotheistic Jews Believe that Jesus is God ? <p> In closing it is worth asking the question : How is it possible for staunch Jewish monotheists ( those who believed in one and only one God and who believed in the unity of that one God " as in Deuteronomy 6:4 , the Lord our God , the Lord is one , the Lord is single , single-minded and united in nature and character ) , how was it possible , for what in the first days were exclusively Jewish followers of Jesus , to use such a bewildering array of titles and descriptions of Jesus ' teaching and behavior that make it clear they believed that He also was God ? The logic here is not that of later councils and creeds , for which it was taken for granted that there were three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain and support this conviction . Rather it seems , following work by such scholars as Larry Hurtado and Richard Bauckham and others , that we must recognize , particularly before AD70 , a flexibility within Jewish monotheism that allowed for exalted angels , for various messianic figures ( including Melchizedek ) , for wisdom itself as a personification of God , for agents who are said to be sent by Him to humanity , even for the great patriarchs such as Abraham and Moses and even Job from antiquity , to be described in language that , at times , does seem to border on , if not even transgress , what in later rabbinic circles and certainly in some pre-Christian Jewish circles would have , by other people , been viewed as blasphemous . We may need to think , at least in part , of an intramural Jewish debate at this juncture . <p> But it is also right to stress that the gospels , like the New Testament in general , go noticeably further in what they attribute to Jesus and predicate of Him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish literature ( as we will see particularly in a later lecture when we turn to the gospel of John ) . Thus , we must supplement at least the partial conceptual possibility within a broader earlier stage of Jewish monotheism with what we might call the experiential necessity ( as James D.G.Dunn has stressed in a variety of his writings ) . In other words , as reluctant as any Jew was in any particular school of thought within Judaism in the early first century to associate a human being fully with God , the teachings of Jesus , the nature of His character , the miracles that worked , the resurrection that appeared to vindicate all of His pre-crucifixion claims , combined together to form such an overwhelming impression of divinity on His first Jewish followers that they felt they had no choice but to use language once reserved entirely for God for Jesus as well . <p> And , if we may appeal to the data of the Acts of the Apostles , and particularly to the permanent , complete indwelling and periodic filling of the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament times for God 's people , it would appear that their experience of the Holy Spirit likewise convinced them that , though invisible like God the Father Himself , the Spirit too should be spoken of in language both of personhood and of divinity . Here , of course , they were drawing on countless references from the Old Testament to the Spirit of God and , on rare occasions in previous Jewish literature , to the Holy Spirit as such . But they elevated Him to a distinct role from the Father , as distinct as Jesus Himself was from the Father . <p> Yet they still used the language of one God , as classically in the Great Commission at the close of Matthew 28 . Here Jesus commands His followers to baptize those who become disciples in the single and singular name ( not names ) of Father , Son and Holy Spirit , even though He proceeds to give three titles . Obviously not all Jews could accept these radical theological developments , and hence the polarization between those who became Jesus ' followers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Implications of the Deity of Christ and His Resurrection <p> For those who did , like many of us today who are their heirs , we may then ask : What are the resulting and lasting theological implications of the deity of Christ and the resurrection that vindicates all that came before of the historical Jesus ? <p> Surely , as we see with the cosmic signs and resurrection of select saints in Matthew 27 and as Paul would later expand on in greater detail in 1 Corinthians 15 , this is the in-breaking of the end . Every bit as much as Jesus ' kingdom teaching pointed to both present and future realities , here the final resurrection at the end of all human history has begun , but it is not completed . It is divided into two stages . But the fact is that Jesus has been resurrected " surprisingly to Jews " in advance of the general resurrection promised in Daniel 12:2 of all humanity . For this very reason , the resurrection of all people and the salvation and infinitely perfect and wonderful resurrection life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as Jesus being the first-fruits of our resurrection . <p> It also means that believers should reflect on life on this planet from this already but not yet perspective . Resurrection life is the ultimate Christian hope . It is not , as in so many religions ancient and modern , disembodied immortality of the soul . Many Christians speak of dying and going to heaven , as if that were the end of the matter . But , as Tom Wright puts it so brilliantly in his large book on The Resurrection of the Son of God , the Christian hope ultimately is not about life after death , but about life after life after death . That is the time when we are reunited with our resurrected bodies and , in a millennium and then eventually in new heavens and a new earth with a new city , the holy Jerusalem descended from heaven , we experience an embodied eternal existence in an embodied " in a purified but still material " universe , which is far greater and far more glorious than mere disembodied depictions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in this life , Christians have a marvelous hope that , through God 's Spirit , should sustain them through the tough times of this world . This is a marvelous hope that is so glorious and unending that before very long the worst hardships of this life will pale into insignificance in comparison . <p> But that is no call for escapism from the realities of this life , because the very nature of that life shows how much God values embodiment " values this earth . It is this earth that will be recreated . And we read in the final chapters of Revelation that the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it in some way largely unspecified in the Bible . Those things that count for God 's kingdom in this life , however much they may still need to be purified , will endure and contribute in some way to the eternal state . So our work in this life , in all walks of life that are honorable and godly and God-pleasing , whether explicitly Christian vocations or not , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of this life , but seek to be Jesus ' faithful disciple at every moment . But then , recognizing since our work never comes even close to being what it could be in this life , that we will have a glorious eternity without the limitations of time as we know it now to which to look forward . Praise the Lord . 
@@35723498 @4723498/ <h> Lesson 09 - Revelation and the Rapture <p> Let 's talk about Apocalyptic literature . It 's fun and exciting stuff and it 's terribly confusing and it 's the most mis-interpreted portion of the canon , etc . <p> Apocalyptic literature arose in a Jewish context . Now here 's a good rule of the thumb . Alright ? If you 're dealing with a neophyte Christian or somebody who has not done any serious study of the New Testament , let me tell you which book of the Bible not to start with . That would be the Revelation . Okay ? <p> Do n't start there . I have to tell you a story . I was riding in the mountains of North Carolina on the Blue Ridge Parkway - not to be confused with the Blue Grass Parkway , which is in Kentucky - with my friend , Doug Harris . This was 1969 and I was driving my father 's Chevy Bel Air two-tone , column shift , 1955 . And the clutch blew out ! <p> As the Bible said , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car off of the Blue Ridge Parkway , down a ramp , into a Texaco station . The guy could n't fix it , so we decided to hitchhike home to the middle of the state of North Carolina . We were picked up by a really wizened , old , elderly couple driving a black ' 48 Plymouth . We got in the car and my friend Doug , who is now a lawyer in North Carolina , said to them , " Well what did you think about the moon landing ? Neil Armstrong ? All that . " <p> They said , " That 's fake . That never happened . Besides , anyway , " said the driver of the car , " everybody knows those pictures of the world , round and revolving are fake . The world is not round . " <p> Doug 's eyes opened like this , and he went , he looked at me . See , the problem with Doug is he did n't recognize invincible ignorance when he saw it . <p> So Doug says , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The man said , " Well , it 's perfectly clear . It says in the Book of Revelations that the angels will spin on the four corners of the earth . It ca n't be round if it 's got four corners , now can it , Mister ? " <p> He had a second infallible proof that I liked better . He said , " Of course the world is not revolving around the sun . I mean , have you ever gone out at nighttime and been standing upside down in your front yard ? I think not , " says the man . <p> I 'm going , " Whoa ! Dude ! " Okay . These were flatlanders from the mountains of North Carolina and there really are still some flatlanders out there . Now what was his problem with his interpretation of the book he called Revelations , which by the way , is not the name of this book ? It 's Revelation , single ; not Revelations , plural . Are you with me now ? So no Revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what it is . <p> The problem is not that he took the Book of Revelation seriously . The problem is , he did n't know what kind of literature it was , and therefore he took figurative language literally . And what that figurative language meant was that God will send his angels to all four corners of the earth to bring in the saved people . <p> It 's a description of theology and history , not cosmology . It 's not trying to teach cosmology . And I do n't know when conservative Christians are ever going to get the point , that it 's not teaching cosmology . It 's teaching history and theology . That 's what it 's teaching . And ethics . Okay ? <p> So , there 's a long history of misinterpreting the Book of Revelation . It 's still happening aplenty today . Just turn on your television sometime . <p> Apocalyptic literature arose in a Jewish context . It arose out of the experience of exile . Now , I want you to think about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary literature first arises out of the experience of exile ? Well , here 's the thing . How long did the exile even of the southern tribes last ? I already told you this . Probably 70 years . That 's more than a generation . <p> How long is a Biblical generation ? Forty . So we 're talking about almost two generations of life here . Right ? Some have lived and died in exile . Some were born in exile and have never experienced the Holy Land . Are you with me now ? You get the picture ? <p> And here 's the problem . The problem is they believed in an almighty , singular god - monotheism - who did justice . And the problem is , that justice was not happening . They were in exile . <p> " Our captors asked us to sing us one of the songs of Zion but how can you sing the songs of Zion when you 're in a foreign land ? " says the Psalmist . <p> Exile had a profound , profound effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still does . And one of the effects was that they learned that justice was not necessarily going to be done in their lifetime . Now this is a shocking revelation if you 're a devout Jew . <p> Do you know how strong the passion is for justice in the human heart ? Just watch TV sometime . Just watch court TV sometime . The passion for justice has always been profound and no more so , than for God 's people who think they are on the right side of God 's law , and He 's a righteous and all-powerful God . <p> So , how come justice is not happening for us ? Yes , ma'am . <p> Female 1 : But they were constantly disobeying - <p> Mm-hmm . <p> Female 1 : God 's word , and He kept reminding them - <p> Yes . <p> Female 1 : Over and over again , and they kept - <p> I know . I know . But you know what , let 's take it personally for a minute . Do n't you ask , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening to me ? I did n't deserve to have that car accident , did I ? Why is this happening to me ? I mean , I 'm a good Christian . Come on , now . " <p> Right ? You get the point ? They were n't claiming to be sinless . They just did n't understand why their captors , who were more wicked than they were , were faring better than they were . Right ? How come ? Why ? And how come justice is not being done ? We 're being enslaved . We 're being killed . We 're being horsewhipped . Why ? <p> Female 1 : You just said they did n't get it . <p> You could say that , but that would be unfair because there were some of them who recognized and repented of their sins when they went into exile , and said , " Lord , okay , we 've done the repentance dance . How about some justice now ? " You know ? <p> " How about at least let 's return from exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't happen for a long time . Then when it did happen it was a shocker. chuckles They were sent home by Cyrus , who is called in the Book of Isaiah " my anointed one " . chuckles <p> The only person in the Old Testament my anointed one by God is not King David ; it 's Cyrus , the pagan ruler of Persia . That 's a shocker . He 's called the messiah . That 's the word . Mashiach . Cyrus was my mashiach . My messiah - Cyrus . He sent his people home . Right ? <p> Well , so here 's the deal . Apocalyptic literature arises when justices is deferred . Apocalyptic literature arises when there are profound questions of theodicy . <p> Why are God 's people suffering disproportionately since they are proportionately better than other people ? Okay ? Why is this happening ? <p> And so what happens , here is the profound thing that happens in exile , is that they begin to develop an actual theology of the afterlife . If things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when ? In the life to come . <p> And what happens in Apocalyptic literature is a development of a profound theology of the afterlife . Not merely life in Heaven . I mean , before the time of Ezekiel you pretty much had to have your names start with " e " to get beamed up into Heaven . You 're either Enoch or Elijah or you do n't go . Right ? <p> What did Jews actually believe about the afterlife prior to the exile ? They believed you died and you were gathered to your ancestors and you lived in Sheol . You 're just in the land of the dead . <p> Unless you 're some superhero prophet you just in the land of the dead . Abraham 's in the land of the dead , was gathered to his ancestors . Isaac 's in the land of the dead ; he was gathered to his ancestors . Jacob , Joseph , Moses - all the big dogs . Okay ? <p> What happens in exile is they begin to have a more viable and positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual theology of Heaven and not Heaven . <p> And not only that , more importantly perhaps , they begin to have a theology of Heaven come on earth at the end of human history . And of course , you can certainly see this in Isaiah . <p> By the time you get to Isaiah , and Second Isaiah anyway , Isaiah 40 through 60 something was probably written from exile . You have the visions of lions lying down with lambs and swords beaten into plowshares . You know , endless vineyards and olive trees , and the sky is not cloudy all day . You know , all of that good stuff . Right ? Oh , home on the range . Are you with me now ? You get the picture ? <p> So , what happens in exile is a much more vital , vibrant and positive view of the afterlife . It begins to develop in Apocalyptic literature . It is not an accident that the first place that the idea of resurrection arises in Jewish literature is in Apocalyptic literature . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dem bones , dem bones , them dry bones , gon na rise up one day . " That would be Ezekiel . <p> The only other place that resurrection is really talked about is in the Prophet Daniel . Daniel 12:1-2 , " You will rise from the dust of the earth and shine like the stars . " It 's Apocalyptic literature that begins to talk about the other world and the afterlife . <p> Now this is the distinction I want you to get hold of , because when they were thinking about a better place , they thought about it in two ways . They thought about it vertically , in terms of the other world , and they thought about it horizontally , in terms of the afterlife . The life after this life , in the future . Okay ? <p> And the emphasis was on the afterlife , not the other world . In fact , in the New Testament that is where the emphasis is . About 10 percent of the New Testament talks about Heaven or Hell . Ninety percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to happen in the future down here . <p> It 's all about what 's going to happen when Jesus comes back and He rules on the earth , and there is a new Heaven and new earth , etc . The finish line is not musically " Somewhere , out there regular voice in Heaven . " <p> No , in the New Testament Heaven is seen as an ultra clean bus station on the way to the new Heaven and the new earth . It 's an interim condition . It 's not the final destination . It 's not God 's final answer on you . <p> Final answer on you is you will be conformed to the image of Christ by resurrection , on the earth , in this world , in the new Heaven and new earth . Okay ? <p> Now this whole theology of the afterlife , of resurrection , of a judgment day in the future that will resolve all justice issues , all of that - this really begins to be developed during the exile and you see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Daniel and in Zechariah . <p> There became a very strong view that if God is not going to rectify things now , He will in the afterlife . He will fix it later , so that by the time you get to the New Testament there is a profound theology of the afterlife running . But there are some old school people . They are called the Sadducees . They were the ones who sang musically " Give me that old time religion . " coughing <p> Their theology was the theology of Sheol . When you die , you 're gathered to your ancestors and you 're just in the land of the dead , and that 's the end of that . <p> They did n't believe in resurrection . They did n't believe in dying and going to Heaven . They just believed you went to Sheol . Right ? That 's the Sadducees . <p> What about the Pharisees ? Did they believe in resurrection ? Yes . That 's what distinguished them , chiefly , from the Sadducees . That 's why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in resurrection . There was a problem here . <p> If I were to ask you who was Jesus more like in terms of the afterlife theology , the Sadducees or the Pharisees , you would say no question He was more like the Pharisees . And so was Paul . <p> In fact , Paul was a card carrying Pharisee before he became a Christian . So some of His belief system carried over quite nicely into his Christian faith . Namely the idea of resurrection . <p> I do n't think I need to emphasize to you , but I will say to you , that the word resurrection does not refer to dying and going to Heaven . And it does not refer to some purely spiritual experience . <p> Resurrection to an early Jew always meant something that happened to a physical body . We 're not talking about a visionary experience when we 're talking about the resurrection of Jesus . We 're not talking about something that 's in the eye of the believing beholder . We 're talking about something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to His followers . <p> This is why Paul , in First Corinthians 15 says , that Christ is but the first fruits of the resurrection . And who would be the latter fruits ? This is the only chance I get to call you fruits . chuckling Okay ? <p> We would be the latter fruits . Right ? A resurrection . We will be conformed to the image of Christ by means of resurrection when He returns . We will be the rest of the crop . Very important . <p> " We shall be made like Him , in the flesh just as we are now being conformed internally to His character . So that He will have brace of kinsmen , risen brothers and sisters like unto Jesus . And we will see Him face to face and reflect His image . " <p> That 's an afterlife theology . I ca n't wait for the day that I 'm really a lot more like Jesus . That 's an afterlife theology . <p> Well , the Book of Revelation has a full-blown afterlife theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of both . It 's minority literature and that means you need to understand symbols . <p> You need to understand the code of language . You need to understand the symbolic numbers . There are all kinds of symbolic numbers . Unfortunately , the Jehovah 's Witnesses did n't get the memo . One hundred forty-four thousand is not intended to be the exact number of the saved . It is a multiple of 12 and up to 12 tribes and it simply means that all of God 's " chilluns " are going to be there . That 's all . It 's a symbolic number that 's a multiple of 12 . <p> You need to understand the symbolic numbers . What are the big symbolic numbers in the Book of Revelation and in early Jewish Gematria ? That would be three , and seven , and 12 and multiples of these numbers . Forty would be another good one , yes . <p> So , 70 is - 10 by the way . Ten is also a big symbolic number . So , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just count to 70 or 700 , you 're supposed to think of this as a big honkin ' number that is complete . The point of the number is it 's a complete number . It 's a perfect number . <p> The same with the thousand year reign . Thousand is a multiple of what ? Ten and a hundred , and he 's not saying it 's going to be exactly a thousand years when Jesus comes back and reigns on the earth before the new Heaven and earth . He 's saying it 's going to be a long old honkin ' time . <p> These are symbolic numbers ; they are not literal numbers any more than the image of the dragon head in Revelation - Mr. Dragon Breath is a literal description - either . <p> They are symbolic numbers and the most important of the symbolic numbers we are going to decode now , so stick with me . I was saving this for a moment when you were flagging . He we go . chuckling <p> Here 's the number : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this number is it 's just shy of seven . So if seven means completion what does 6-6-6 mean ? It is the number of chaos ; of incompletion . Of destruction . Very important . But there is so much more to this number and now the truth is about to be told . So here we go . <p> It is deliberately a coded number . Now let me explain to you about Gematria for a minute . writing on board Gematria is the practice of turning names into numbers . You with me now ? <p> You assign numerical value to letters of an alphabet . It could be the Hebrew alphabet . It could be the Greek alphabet . It could be the Latin alphabet . Are you with me now ? <p> It 's assigning numbers to names . So , for example , in the catacombs you see this graffiti . It says , " I love a girl whose name is 6-1-4 . " That 's not her cell phone number . That 's her name . It 's Gematria . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister was here who could actually draw , but you 'll have to put up with me . <p> Here is a coin . This is a Roman coin . Got a good Roman nose there . This is Nero . Are you with me now ? We 'll put a little laurel wreath on his head . Here he is . This is a denarius ; a silver denarius . On the silver denarius of Nero , which by the way , he had these little spiky things on the laurel crown which indicated his divinity . If you get spiky bits on the laurel crown it indicates that you have and you are radiating divine glory . Alright ? <p> Now , here 's what the inscription says : writing on board Neron Caesar divi filii Augusti . Nero Caesar the divine son of the divine Augustus . You with me now ? It 's a claim to divinity , and here 's where I tell you that if you add up the numerical value of all of the letters on the front of this coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to John of Patmos ? That would be Nero . Who was the first person who instigated a persecution of Christians ? That would be Nero . He was the archetypal image of the anti-Christ . But here 's the thing . Notice I said the archetypal image of the anti-Christ . What they believed was that in every age of the eschaton there were false Christs and false prophets and all kinds of nefarious dudes running around . <p> Nero sits for the portrait of Mr. Six-Six-Six and when he wants to describe the final Mr. Six-Six-Six , he says he 's going to be like that bad boy . You get the picture ? <p> Now everybody knew about Nero , and he was not anybody Christian 's hero . But then what happened is the Nero legend . According to the Nero legend Nero came back from the dead . He had a fatal wound in his head and he rose from the dead and he reappeared in the emperor 's chair as Domitian ; as Domitianus . <p> The ruler in the ' 90s who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two emperors in the first century A.D. who persecuted Christians . Nero and Domitian . One in the ' 60s , one in the ' 90s and what was whispered by Jews and Christians about Domitianus is he 's Nero back from the dead . He 's Nero redivivus . He 's Nero , the sequel . A little bit louder and a little bit worse . <p> You see , the thing about these archetypal symbols that are being used is that they are multivalent. writing on board What does the word multivalent mean ? Any of you know this word ? We need a definition , right ? <p> Multi " means more than one , right ? " Valent " means value . So multivalent would mean that this symbol is deliberately , deliberately more universal . It 's deliberately vague ; it 's deliberately more universal because why ? <p> It 's not just describing one person . It 's describing a kind of person . A type of person . A world ruling , tyrannical , Christian-hating dictator . That 's what it 's describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit for that portrait . <p> How about Stalin or Mussolini or Adolph Hitler , or Idi Amin ? We could keep going . There are a lot of people that could sit for this picture . No question . In every age of church history . <p> What John is saying is once the eschaton begins you 're going to have people like this . The battle of good and evil is going to keep on going until its brought to a close . And what 's going to bring it to a close is not any preliminary events that happen . What 's going to bring it to close is the return of the thief in the night . <p> So whatever the mess is that we 're suffering now and wherever we are on the eschatological time clock is really quite irrelevant . The bottom line is , God is still in His Heaven and all will be right with the world when Jesus comes back . <p> And that 's the message . And in the meantime , do n't be silly little naive Christians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation or government , or principles or constitutions . Do n't do that because the kingdom that you owe allegiance to is the Kingdom of God and the citizenship that matters to you is the citizenship you have in Heaven . <p> That 's the message to the Christians . So it 's deconstructing any kind of idolatrus loyalties to particular earthly systems . And it 's intended to do that . One of the ways it does that is it depicts an emperor who is like Darth Vader . It 's an archetypal multivalent symbol . <p> Now , does John believe that there will probably be one ultra big , ultra bad emperor at the end of human history that Jesus is going to have to come deal with ? Yes , he probably does . But he 's not trying to give you a description of who that will be by name . He 's trying to give you a character description of what kind of person he will be . <p> He will be like Nero . He will be like Domitian . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell people is , I have no idea who this is going to be , but I sure know what kind of person he 's going to be . And I sure know what kind of empire he 's interested in building . And it sure ai n't Christian . " <p> You know a lot about the character of the future . You do n't know the particulars about times and dates and personal names . And that 's okay . I 'd rather know the character of how it 's going to come out than all of the particulars . It 's alright with me . I can trust God for the particulars . <p> Now , as I say here , many of these symbols are deliberately multivalent . They are referential but they could refer to a variety of persons and things because they are so generic in character , and that 's by intention . It 's be design . <p> It 's not because John practices fuzzy math . It 's not because John has fuzzy thoughts about the future . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal . Enough about the future to give us hope . <p> Not so much that we have this enormously detailed blueprint about exactly everything blow-by-blow and how it 's going to happen because we do n't . We do n't know . <p> Now , here 's where it gets interesting and it shows you how plastic these images are . I read to you Ezekiel 1 , right ? Remember Ezekiel 1 ? chuckling Now I 'm going to read to you Revelation 4 . This should sound eerily familiar , but not identical . sound of page turning Listen to Revelation Chapter 4. sound of pages turning <p> " After this , " says John , " I looked in there in Heaven and doors did open . And the first voice which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said , ' Come up here and I 'll show you what must take place after this . ' At once I was in the spirit and there in Heaven stood a throne . " <p> Now , just for a moment - this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patmos into Heaven . He 's on the Island of Patmos . This is about a spiritual visionary experience . He sees into Heaven when he becomes in the spirit and is inspired to see a vision into Heaven . <p> So this is not about flying Air Ruach to Heaven . Right ? He 's in the spirit and he sees into Heaven . He 's still firmly planted on Patmos and he 's in exile . He 's in exile . He 's out there saying musically " You load 16 tons and what do you get ? Another day older and deeper in debt . Saint Peter do n't you call me , ' cause I ca n't go . I owe my soul to the Roman Empire . " Or something like that . murmuring Right ? <p> He 's in exile . He 's in a mining colony on the Island of Patmos in exile , but he has a vision of Heaven . So what does he see ? Listen to what he sees . <p> " I was in the spirit and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne and the one seated there looks like " - I want to ask you to count again , Sam , we 're going to get a lot of likes here . Right ? <p> " And the one seated there looked like jasper and carnelian . And around the throne was a rainbow that looks like an emerald and around the throne were 24 thrones and seated on the throne were 24 elders dressed in white robes with gold crowns on their heads . <p> " And coming from the throne are flashes of lightning and rumbles and peals of thunder . In front of the throne burnt seven flaming torches which are the seven spirits of God . And in front of the throne there is something that 's like a sea of crystal like glass . <p> " And around the throne on each side of the throne are four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind . The first living creature is like a lion . The second living creature is like an ox . The third living creature has a face like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle . " <p> By the way , this is where you get the four medieval symbols for the gospels . It 's from these four critters in Ezekiel and in Revelation . <p> The lion is the symbol for which gospel ? muttering No . That would be the eagle . The eagle eye view of the gospel . The ox is the symbol for Luke . The human face is the symbol for Mark , and so the lion gospel is - <p> Male 1 : Matthew . <p> Matthew . That 's right . And that 's where the medieval symbols for the gospels come from . They come this Revelation which has nothing to do with the gospels , but that 's okay . <p> " And the four living creatures , each of them with six wings are full of eyes all around , inside , day and night without ceasing they sang Holy , Holy , Holy , Lord God Almighty , who was , and is , and is to come . <p> " And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne who lives forever and ever , the 24 elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives there forever and ever . " <p> They are casting down their crowns before the throne , singing musically " Thou art worthy , thou art worthy , thou art worthy , oh , Lord . To receive glory , glory and honor and glory and honor and power . " <p> " For by you we were all created and by your will we exist . " Amen <p> Now , if you compare Ezekiel 1 which is much longer to this vision than Revelation 4 , are there striking similarities ? Yes . Absolutely so . Are they identical ? No . <p> For one thing , the eyes are in different places . Got eyes in the wheels back there . Got eyes elsewhere here . <p> For another thing , the four living creatures are described differently . It seems in Ezekiel the four living creatures each have four faces . Here we have one living creature per face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these images are plastic . They 're not literal descriptions . They are metaphorical descriptions , and therefore they are malleable . They can change . <p> Now , here 's where it gets exciting . This is an image of worship . Worship going on in Heaven , and guess who 's worshipping ? Everybody . All creatures great and small . <p> You 've got the angels . You 've got the critters . You 've got the human beings represented by the elders , and they are all lifting up the throne of God . Wow ! <p> This is a vision of worship . That 's what it is . Heavenly worship . You know , in the Orthodox tradition they believe that what we 're doing on earth is participating in Heavenly worship if we do it right . <p> So we are joining with the saints in Heaven worshipping God . Right ? But that image is of all of creations . The animal creation , the angelic creation , the human creation . All of those things that are not the creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipping the creator . In the next chapter we have the worshipping of the redeemer . The lamb . <p> So , this is the worshipping of the creator god , and in the next chapter it 's the worshipping of the redeemer god . It 's a powerful two chapters that go together - Revelation 4 and 5 . <p> And it gives you a powerful start to this whole book , because what is going on here is God is being worshipped for what He is about to do to transform the world into His kingdom . And these folks were all thanking God for both the justice and the redemption that is yet to come . <p> Remember , we get to this Revelation and the saints under the altar in Heaven are cranky . They go , " How long , oh , Lord ? " You remember this ? <p> They 're not up there going , musically " I 've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb . I 've been redeemed . " You know ? <p> How long before the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choir robe and they 're told to hush . All in God 's good time . All in God 's good time . <p> You see , the saints in Heaven are n't finished and they know they 've not reached the finish line . They know that God 's not done yet . Those who are up there are awaiting what happens down here to finish , and we will be joined with them when Jesus returns with the saints . <p> It 's a powerful image in the Book of Revelation . It 's a powerful theology of the afterlife and what that theology of the afterlife in the end times does , is it comes back and changes the way we look at things now , like worship . <p> Worship in light of the eschaton should look different . It 's part of what Revelation is trying to teach us . <p> Now , if you compare the throne chariot vision in Ezekiel 1 and the one in Revelation 4 , it 's perfectly clear that these images are flexible and plastic . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're dealing with analogical language . " It was like " and metaphorical language . <p> The description of Christ in the Book of Revelation is very interesting and it 's metaphorical . Jesus is not Bar am You in Heaven . Jesus is a human being in Heaven , but he 's described as the lamb . The slain lamb who has yet triumphed and is on the throne . <p> This image here is the central image or way of depicting Christ in this book . It 's the most frequent image of Christ in this book , by far . He 's only called the lion of the Tribe of Judah once . He 's called Alpha and Omega once at the beginning of the Book of Revelation , once at the end . He 's called Christ and He 's called Lord , and you know , Son of God , now and again , in the Book of Revelation <p> But the central and most important image is of the slain lamb . Now why do you think that is ? Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reigning from above is the central image and message to be conveyed to this seven churches ? <p> Male 2 : Could that be because of persecution and harm that they are experiencing and that they are slain ? <p> Absolutely because Jesus is the witness who sets the pattern for Martus , thus as witnesses , who will faithfully witness even unto death . Listen to the promises given to the seven churches just for a minute . And the promises , of course , all come at the end of each message . <p> " To everyone who conquers , I will give permission to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God . " <p> This is verse seven of chapter 2 . The end of the message to the church in Ephesus . Now , by the way , the verb " conquer " is nikao from which we get Nike , as in victory . Are you with me ? As in Nike tennis shoes . Nikao is the Greek word . Here is the verb , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What does he mean by conquering ? He means being faithful unto death and dying with your boots on for the Lord . Conquering does n't have to do with military victory over other peoples in this book . Conquering has to do with remaining faithful even unto death for the Lord . Everyone who conquers I will give permission to eat from the tree of Life that is in the paradise of God . <p> Or take the message to Smyrna , the end says : 10B - " Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of life and let anyone who has ears to hear , listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches . Whoever conquers will not be harmed by the second death . " <p> Notice you are not promised exemption from the first death . This is the Book of the Martyrs , friends . This is the book of the martyrs . <p> Listen to the end of the message to Pergamum. pages turning <p> " To everyone who conquers I 'll give some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it . " <p> Or the end of the message to Thyatiera , verse 28 : " Even as I also received authority from the Father to the one who conquers I will also give the morning star . Let everyone who has ears listen to what the spirit is saying to the churches . " <p> Or verse 26 even . " To everyone who conquers and continues to do my work to the end I will give authority over the nations . Only hold fast until I come . " <p> Or the end of the Revelation to Sardis , verse of chapter 3 . " If you conquer you will be clothed like them in white robes and I will not blot your name out of the book of life . " <p> By the way , this implies that your name could be blotted out of the book of life if you commit apostasy . These chapters 2 and 3 are strong warnings against apostasy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be martyred . The negative possible outcome would be apostasy , and if you commit apostasy , guess what . Your name may have been provisionally in the book of live , but it can be blotted out . In other words , you 're not eternally secure until you 're securely in eternity . <p> Short of that , apostasy is possible . That 's the warning here . It 's intended to be a strong warning . <p> The message to Laodicea , the last of these . Listen to the end , verse 21 . " To the one who conquers I 'll give a place with me on my throne just as I myself conquered . " <p> Did you hear that ? We 're going to conquer in the same way that Jesus conquered . And how did Jesus conquer ? By dying on the cross . Conquering comes through dying , not through killing . <p> " To the one who conquers I 'll give a place with me on my throne just as I myself conquered , and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears hear what I have to say to the churches . " <p> What we 're dealing here , then , is a church that 's being pressured , persecuted , in some cases prosecuted , in rare cases executed - I 'm not talking about mass persecution in the sense of mass execution . We do n't have any historical evidence for that . <p> But what we do have is evidence of Christians having their property confiscated , being thrown into jail for a period , being harassed , being shunned , being - having their businesses burned down . All of that sort of stuff , and occasionally there was martyrdom as well . <p> Well , our author is saying get ready for it . Are you ready to rumble ? This is what 's going to happen to you . Right ? And he 's saying , if need be , you need to be prepared to die with your boots on . You need to be prepared to be faithful unto death like Jesus was , and die a martyr 's death . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've talked to you about Gematria . I 've talked to you about the symbolic numbers three , seven , 10 , 12 , 6-6-6 . Here 's where I want to talk to you about how different John 's revelation is from other early Jewish Apocalypses of which we have about 15 . <p> You know , this is often a revelation to Christians . There are about 15 other early Jewish Apocalypses that you can read to compare to the Book of Revelation and you discover very quickly what kind of literature this is . <p> For example , you could read the Book of Enoch . In particular you could read the so-called Parables of Enoch and what you discover is , that Enoch is taken on a heavenly journey , given a tour of Heaven very much like some of the descriptions of Heaven in the Book of Revelation . There are plenty of other early Jewish Apocalypses . This is just one of them . <p> What makes this book stand apart from these other early Jewish Apocalypses is they seem to be almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pseudonymous ? <p> So , for example , the Testament of Abraham , a Jewish Apocalyptic book - not written by Abraham . The Testament of Isaac - not written by Isaac ; the Testament of Jacob - not written by Jacob ; Testament of Levi - not so much . <p> These were documents written in the first century B.C. or the first century A.D. who are attributed to ancient worthies and the reason they are attributed to ancient worthies is so that they will be books that look like prophecy but are in fact , not . <p> Let me say that one more time so it sinks in . These documents that have pseudonymous authors appended to them are made to look like prophecies given from really a long time ago when in fact they were written in the first century B.C. or the first century A.D. , and so instead of being prophecy presented , they are actually history written up as if it had been prophecy from long time ago . You see what I 'm saying ? <p> So , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What stands out about John of Patmos is he 's not claiming to be Enoch . He 's claiming to be - wait for it - John of Patmos ! He 's speaking in his own voice . He 's using his own name and he is indeed offering genuine prophecy , not pseudo prophecy . <p> There was a lot of pseudo prophecy out there . As a consequence , what we 're dealing with in the Book of Revelation is actual Apocalyptic prophecy like that of Ezekiel and Daniel and Zechariah . What we are not dealing with is Apocalyptic prophecy like that in the pseudonymous early Jewish books that are called Apocalyptic books . We 're dealing with genuine prophecy , if you will , in the Book of Revelation . <p> Now here 's the other thing . To interpret the Book of Revelation you need a lot of prior understanding up front of the kind of literature we 're dealing with . You need more contextual help , not less . What I tell young Christians is , start easy ; work up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple like the Sermon on the Mount . <p> " Blessed are the poor . " Okay . Let 's start with that . If you do n't have the prior knowledge , if you do n't have the contextual understanding it 's like dealing with a fractured fairy tale . It does n't have coherence . <p> What do you think John of Patmos assumes about the understanding of his audience before he writes these 20 plus chapters of prophecy ? Do you think he assumes there are enough Jews in his audience that understand Apocalyptic literature ? That somebody is going to get this and understand it and help the rest of the church to understand it ? <p> Yes , I think he absolutely has to assume that . If he was writing to a purely Gentile audience they would have been going , " Say what ? " If they did not know the Old Testament , if they did not know Jewish Apocalyptic coughing literature , this would not make a whole lot of sense . <p> And indeed , here 's the other interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second century A.D. the church is largely Gentile . Into the third and fourth century A.D. even more so . Are you with me now ? The more Gentile the church becomes the less it understands the Book of Revelation . <p> And this ignorance continued well into church history . John Calvin said , and I quote , " I have written a commentary on every other book of the New Testament but frankly I do n't understand the Book of Revelation , and so I 'm not writing a commentary on it . " <p> Martin Luther had a little chutzpah . He said , " You know , it 's hard to understand , but I think I 've got it . The anti-Christ is the pope . Let 's start there . " On further review , he was wrong , but I understand why he said it . <p> John Wesley , on his notes on the New Testament , he said , " You know , fool 's rush in where angels fear to tread . " <p> I 'm going to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm doing is simply repeating what that great German scholar Johannes Bengel said . " Take it for what it is . I do n't claim this is a perfect interpretation . I simply think it 's better than the other ones I 've read . " <p> So he 's not sure what 's going on with the Book of Revelation , either . And the reason , dear friends , is we are so far removed from being a Jewish group who understands early Jewish literature and Jewish ways of thinking and Jewish Apocalyptic thought in general , that we are clueless and bound to misinterpret it . <p> And of course , this is what has drastically happened and in dispensationalism . Which leads me to take just a little side turn and deal with this dispensationalism and the theology of the Rapture , so , it 's time for some Rapture theology . I promised you more excitement as we went on , so we 're going to have the more now . <p> Let 's deal with the history of dispensationalism first . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we 're going to deal with the history of dispensationalism and then we 're going to deal with the text that they think talks about a Rapture . <p> So , a little background . It starts with a wee Scottish girl named Margaret McDonald in 1830 . She went to a revival in Glasgow and she had a visionary experience . There was at that revival a very famous preacher . His name was John Nelson Darby . He was the founder of the Plymouth Brethren . <p> John Nelson Darby was the found of the Plymouth Brethren which was an important low church Protestant movement in the 19th century that led to all kinds of things . What Margaret McDonald had a vision of was of a pre-tribulation Rapture of the church out of the world before all of this gnarly stuff happens to happen before Jesus comes back . <p> She 's the first person in church history that we know of who talked about a Rapture of the church out of the world during some terrible period of tribulation , or right before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have died completely except for John Nelson Darby . Darby was an evangelist both in the U.K. and in the U.S. So follow the bouncing ball now . <p> He comes to the United States before the Civil War . He runs into a man named D.L. Moody , the most famous evangelist of his day in the 19th century ; the Billy Graham of his day . And the Civil War was breaking out in 1860 and tearing our country to shreds . <p> Do you know that more Americans died in the Civil War than in all subsequent wars we have fought combined ? More Americans died in those 4 1/2 - 5 years than in all World War I , World War II , the Korean War , the Vietnam War , etc. , etc. , etc . We lost more humanity in that one war on our own soil than all subsequent wars combined since . <p> It was a horrific period of time and Christians could be forgiven for saying , " Beam me up , Scotty . I want out of here . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed off . " <p> In terms of the history of this dispensationalism let me tell you right now , any time America gets into a crisis , dispensational theology plays really well . The sales of dispensational books go way up . No question . <p> A good example would be a book by John Walvoord , Armageddon and Middle East Oil . It was first published in the ' 70s during the oil crisis ; sold well . When the Gulf War came around , new edition . When you get into a crisis mode the comfort food that lots of conservative Christians want is dispensational theology which promises there is a way out of here . You 're going to be beamed up . You do n't have to suffer . Or at least not much . <p> So this theology of Rapture which led to the whole system of dispensationalism begins to spread during the American Civil War and then after the Civil War , but that 's by no means all . <p> Let 's talk about the ideas that are involved . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at all is that Christ was coming back twice . Once invisibly to the Rapture of the church and once visibly to judge the world . <p> The early church did n't believe that . The first century church did n't believe that , the second century church did n't believe that . They believed there would be only one second coming , not a second and a third coming . They believed in only one second coming . <p> And here 's part of the problem with the dispensational hermeneutic . The hermeneutic divides up ideas and texts into two piles . Here are prophecies meant for Israel ; here are prophecies meant for the church . Here are prophecies about the invisible return of Christ ; here are prophecies about the second coming for judgment that will be visible . Okay ? <p> There 's a lot of bifurcating of things that the early church all thought referred to one thing and not two things . What we are told by Miss McDonald and then Darby and then D.L. Moody is that the former of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven for at least seven years or we could debate how long it 's going to be . <p> However , the real second coming is called the Glorious Appearing , which is mentioned in Titus 2:13 when the New Jerusalem will be established on earth as it is in Heaven . That 's the second coming that everybody agrees is going to happen . <p> Here 's what happened . The harmonic convergence of the message of Darby , between 1859 and 1977 , and the desire to escape from the horrors of the Civil War were so strong that it was during this period of time - especially in the south , because the whole Civil War except Gettysburg , was fought basically in the south , right ? It became so ingrained in the south that this whole Rapture theology took root in the south and grew and spread like Kudzu across the land . Like a vine in all directions , as a theological form of comfort food . <p> If we talk about Darby himself , you have to say about Darby that he abstained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the timing of the second coming , or the Parousia , the Glorious Appearing . <p> Subsequent prognosticators did not so refrain . Dwight L. Moody , for whom Moody Bible Institute is named ; form whom Moody Press is named ; Moody Radio Network is named , the whole nine yards . Right ? Moody was a disciple of Darby . He was a Darbyite . He was a disciple of Darby . He got this theology from Darby . <p> And so Moody set up Moody Bible Institute . And he initially did the most to spread the message of dispensationalism in the last few decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century . <p> Here is the point . This is new theology . This theology is as new as Mormonism . It began in the 19th century . It 's continued today , into the 21st century . Right ? This is not the original theology of the early church . It 's something new . <p> Then there 's this fellow . Every hear of the Scofield Reference Bible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of these folks were good , sincere Christians . Cyrus Scofield was a scoundrel . <p> Cyrus Scofield was someone who ran out on his wife , committed all kinds of fraud , got himself out of hot water with his idea of selling Bibles . A particular kind of Bible . A Bible that had notes at the bottom of the page . But here was the kicker . Scofield decided to put headings in the text of the Bible . As in , " This passage refers to the Rapture. " chuckling <p> Just so you get it clearly , not in the notes . In the text of the Bible there 's a bold headline in all capped letters , right ? Jesus predicts the Rapture . That sort of thing . Nice subtle theology . Right in the text . <p> He 's an entrepreneur . He abandons his family . He 's in jail . If you want to read the real story of this shyster read a book by J.M. Canfield entitled The Incredible Cyrus Scofield and His Book He 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Scofield Reference Bible is published in 1909 and becomes a million seller in 1913 . What happened in 1913 ? And ' 14 ? And ' 15 ? Here we go . Archduke Ferdinand , World War I ramping up . By the time Mr. Scofield got to 1920 and the end of World War I he had made a lot of money off our misery by giving us a Bible that says , " We can get out of here . Beam me up . " It 's true . <p> There 's another person who helped the movement along , and his name was W.E . Dubois . He was a Chicago businessman who was in contact with Moody , and he wrote the best selling Christian book in the last two decades of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century . No , it was not In His Steps . The best selling book is Jesus is Coming . <p> But this is a businessman that was afraid of the implications of losing his business if people did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name W.E.B . Just the initials instead of his full name . Jesus is Coming , in 1787 . <p> Here 's where I tell you that the full-blown dispensational schema of theology , of dividing the church history up into periods comes based on not any knowledge of Greek or Hebrew at all . <p> Where does it come from ? It comes from a particular reading of the King James Bible . Why would that surprise you ? What 's the number one Bible of America at the beginning of the 20th century ? <p> It 's the King James Bible , by far the most popular and most sold Bible . The dispensational schema was based on a certain kind of close reading of the King James Version and not of the original manuscripts of the New Testament . <p> Here 's where I say it was a laity movement . Dispensationalism was carried by strong lay people , not by clergy . There was a clergy person who was worried about this . He was a Presbyterian minister and his name was Lewis Chafer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disturbed that there was n't more exegetical and theological underpinning to this whole theology of the Rapture , so he founded the Dallas Dispensational Training Center in 1924 . Guess what it 's called today ? Dallas Theological Seminary . This was Dallas Theological Seminary . <p> And what was the purpose ? The original purpose of Dallas Dispensational Training Institute ? To provide a scholarly basis for a theology they already believed . Let me say that one more time . The reason for the founding of Dallas Dispensational Training Center was , that in fact , they wanted to provide scholarly underpinnings for a theology they already believed . <p> So with the after the fact justification by scholarship , its eisegesis before exegesis . That 's exactly right . So , Dallas Dispensational Institute evolves into Dallas Theological Seminary . <p> Now , I have to tell you that today Dallas Theological Seminary is miles apart from the Dallas Dispensational Institute in the ' 20s . There are plenty of good Christian scholars there , but they do all still subscribe to the theology of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to teach on that faculty . <p> One of the things that this movement , that this dispensational movement did is it spawned a whole series of people who were really zealous about spreading the dispensational truth . There were a whole series of writers , some of whose names you should know , who wrote million selling books that promoted this theology . John Walvoord , who was the president of this seminary , Dallas Theological Seminary , in 1952 to ' 86 . Charles Ryrie , maybe you 've heard of the Ryrie Study Bible , which was the supplement , or replacement for the Scofield Reference Bible . <p> These folks all come out of Dallas Theological Seminary . The whole batch of them . And a few supplements from Moody Bible Institute . These are the two big in the mid-west bastions of dispensational theology and they are , you know , publishing their way into the Kingdom of God . They are big on publishing popular books that get lay people all " het " up about this theology and they have enormously succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million books . Oh , yes . It 's a little scary , honestly . But , you know , it 's strange where you find encouragement . There was a year , 2004 , when in Dan Brown 's The DaVinci Code outsold the Bible in that given year in America . Do you know what he eclipsed off the best-seller list ? One of The Left Behind books . chuckling Neither of them very helpful when it comes to eschatology . <p> All of these persons , whether scholars or not , has spread the hermeneutic of this system through popular books , pamphlets , coughing tracks , and revivals . <p> Here 's the conclusion about the history . Dispensationalism is a theory of interpreting Biblical prophecy which does not have deep historical roots and is not well grounded in the history of the interpretation of the Bible by the church over many centuries in particular . <p> Now I want to stress this . No one was arguing for Rapture doctrine before 1830 . No one , which is severely problematic , because you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the " new " that is the true ; it 's the " old " . It 's not the latest that 's the greatest ; it 's the original . And that 's part of the problem here . <p> I want to get at the heart of the matter because the heart of the matter is , they do n't understand prophecy and they especially do n't understand Apocalyptic prophecy . This is really the heart of the problem that we 're dealing with here . How so ? <p> Well , several points . Point number one : They do n't understand that most Old Testament prophecy was either , one - conditional ; or two - has already been fulfilled ; or three - was speaking about a situation in the life of Israel long , long ago , not speaking about the eschatological age . Three-pronged point . <p> Some of the prophecies in the Old Testament were deliberately conditional , and if Israel did n't meet the condition , they were n't happening . <p> " If my people call by my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happens if they do n't repent ? All bets are off . It 's a conditional promise . It 's a conditional prophecy . <p> Secondly , most of the prophecies in the prophetic books of the Old Testament were near horizon prophecies . They were prophecies about their own age , or shortly thereafter . <p> They 're not about now , in the 21st century . They were never about now . They were about then . They were words on target then . <p> Thirdly , only a tiny minority of Old Testament prophecy is eschatological in character , speaking about the end of days . The end of the age . <p> I would say less than 15 percent of all prophetic text in the Old Testament are dealing with eschatology . They 're not . They 're mainly dealing with the history of Israel at some point or other juncture . <p> Female 2 : Is that the same ? <p> Yes , maybe 10 to 15 percent . And guess which portion is most likely to give us something that 's about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Zechariah . Or , Second Isaiah ; Isaiah 40 and following . That 's pretty much it . <p> Now here 's the other thing . When you get to the New Testament era Jesus is saying that all of this is being fulfilled in Him and in His movement . Now this is the crucial thing . This is the most important problem with dispensationalism other than the idea of the Rapture . Paul puts it this way . <p> " The promises and prophecies of God are all yea and amen in Christ Jesus . " <p> And did you catch that ? Let me say it one more time . I 'm going to lay it out to you in lavender . <p> " The promises and prophecies of God are fulfilled in and through Christ and His people and not elsewhere . " <p> Are you beginning to get the picture here ? There are not two peoples of God at any one time in human history . There is only one people of God . Who is the people of God ? Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are not two peoples of God right now on the earth . There is only one . <p> And Paul is very clear about this . He says that Jews who have rejected their messiah are temporarily broken off from the people of God . Go back and read Romans 9 through 11 . He 's perfectly clear about this . Where are the people of God on earth ? Answer : In the New Testament there is only one answer . It 's Jesus and His people . That 's the only people of God . <p> There are not two , three or 10 peoples of God . There is only one , and therefore , the promises of Abraham , says Paul , are fulfilled through Christ and for Christ 's people . The promises of Moses , and Isaac , and Jacob and David are fulfilled into Christ , and in His people and for His people . Not elsewhere . <p> So , should we be looking for the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem ? No . We should be looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a battle between Iraq and Iran and Israel ? No . We should n't . We should be looking for the return of Christ . <p> Should we think that in 1947 when a secular , socialist state was set up in Israel based on the theories of David Ben-Gurion , that we have now gotten back to Biblical Israel ? No . <p> Even the Orthodox Jews in Israel say , " Oy , vey ! We are not living according to the Bible . " The Knesset is not the Sanhedrin . You need to understand that Israel as it is now constituted is a modern , secular democracy . It 's not Biblical Israel and even Orthodox Jews do not think it 's Biblical Israel . Okay ? <p> None of the Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled in 1947 when the secular state of Israel was set up . That 's not what it 's about . This is all dispensational theology . This is all dispensational interpretation . The signs of the end times . Israel has been set up . This is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? If the prophets were here today they 'd all say , " You know , this is a surprise to me , because this is not what I had in mind . " <p> And even more so , the writers of the New Testament would say , " This is a big surprise to me because honestly , I thought all the promises and prophecies of God were fulfilled in Christ and in His people and not somewhere apart from Christ . " <p> It 's an incredible hermeneutic that divides the promises and prophecies of God into two piles and says one is for secular , or non-Christian Israel , and the other is for the church . That 's not how the Old Testament reads . <p> All the promises and prophecies in the Old Testament are simply for the people of God . And all the promises and prophecies in the New Testament are simply for the people of God . And that 's it . There is no such division of labor between the promises for Israel and the promises for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic is the failure to recognize that the writers of the New Testament are unanimous . They are unanimous . All the prophecies and promises of God are fulfilled in Christ and in His people . Jew and Gentile united in Christ . Not two different peoples of God . Not through two different comings of Christ . Just one in each case . <p> In other words , what 's going down in dispensationalism is that their authors of dispensational books do not agree with the hermeneutics of the New Testament writers . They do not agree that all these prophecies are fulfilled in Christ and in His people , which is exactly what the New Testament writers are claiming . As Paul puts it , " All of this is ' yes ' and ' amen ' and Jesus Christ and in His people . " <p> I 'm not going to go through all of that . I do want to look just for a couple of minutes , because I know you 're tired , about a couple of Rapture texts . We need to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding of the Rapture texts just for a minute . <p> I 've already dealt with this one . " I was in the spirit on the Lord 's day and I heard and I saw . " <p> Is this about a Rapture into Heaven ? It is not . It is about a visionary experience . We could look at a parallel to that in Revelation 17 where John says " I was taken in the spirit to see something by a lake where there was this beast in the water . " Revelation 17 . <p> Again , he 's not moving from the Island of Patmos . He 's seeing in the spirit . This is not about a Rapture or about flying Air Ruach . <p> Revelation 17:3 , " The angel carried me away . " Not in the flesh . He carried me away in the spirit , into the desert . Not in the flesh . This is not about Holy Spirit Transportation System . It 's not about that . It 's about having a vision . <p> In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize the character of Apocalyptic visions . That 's the problem . Now , I 'm really going to get to the coup de grace . Up to now I have been teaching , and now I 'm going to start meddling . I 'm working my way to a climax here . <p> Remember all of those " one was left and the other was taken " texts ? Let 's deal with them for a minute . Matthew 24 . Only we 're going to have to hear them with first century ears to get the point . Matthew 24:36-41 . A very favorite text for dispensational theology . <p> " But about that day and hour no one knows . Neither the angels in Heaven nor the Son , only the Father . Whereas the days of Noah were , so will be the days of the coming of the Son of Man . <p> " For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , and marrying and giving in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all away . <p> " So , too , will it be like this in the coming of the Son of Man . There will be two in the field . One will be taken away and the other will be left behind . " <p> Now , in the Noah story , who was swept away ? The lost . Who was left behind ? The good guys . Noah and those in the ark . Are you with me now ? The left behind are going " Whew ! I 'm glad I missed that judgment . " <p> The taken away are the ones taken away for judgment . This is not about a Rapture , pre- , post- or mid-tribulation . This is about judgment on those who were taken away and those who were left behind are going , " Thank God I was left behind . " <p> This has nothing to do with the pre-tribulation Rapture . It has to do with escaping the final judgment . Praise God for those left behind . <p> But then , the real coup de grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses exactly the opposite of what they mean . The left behind are seen as the poor slobs who are going to get zapped . Quite the opposite of that . <p> But the real coup de grace comes with the misinterpretation of First Thessalonians 4 . We got to finish with a bang here . We 're going to finish with First Thessalonians 4 , so get on your jet boots . We 're going up to rise up into the air and meet Jesus . Here we go . Listen closely . I 'm going to start with verse 13 of chapter 4 . <p> " But we do n't want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about those who have died . " <p> First of all , this is an attempt to offer pastoral comfort . You with me now ? Pastoral comfort , to a church that 's persecuted . If you read all of First and Second Thessalonians , these Christians are being persecuted . They 've lost some of their loved ones . Some of them have been killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are still remaining faithful . <p> " But we do n't want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about those who have died , so that you may not grieve as , God will bring with Him those who have died . " <p> You see ? It 's comfort that 's going on here . <p> " For this we declared to you by the word of God that we who are alive who are left until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those have died . For the Lord Himself , with the cry of command , with the archangels ' call and the sound of God 's , will be caught up into the air and the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air . " <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal Heaven . He 's talking about in the atmosphere . This is not about a Rapture into Heaven . It 's about going up to meet Him in the air . Very important . <p> " And so we will be with the Lord forever . " <p> Alright . Now , let 's get the picture here . And in order to get the picture , you 're going to have to understand something about the way a king came to a town . So , let 's see if we can get this . <p> The second half of Psalm 24 is an entrance liturgy , so I 'm going to give you a part . You 're going to help me out here . Alright ? <p> Your line is " Who is the King of glory ? " Are You with me now ? I think you can handle this . chuckling <p> " Lift up your heads , o ye gates . Be lifted up ye ancient doors , so the King of glory may come in . " <p> Audience : " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , strong and mighty . The Lord mighty in battle . Lift up your heads , o ye gates . Be lifted up ye ancient doors , so the King of glory may come in . " <p> Audience : " Who is the King of glory ? " <p> " The Lord . The Lord . He is the King of glory . " <p> Now this is an entrance liturgy which talks about the process of how you welcome a king into a city . Alright ? And this is the image Paul is going to use here in this passage to describe the return of the king , Christ Himself . <p> Here 's the process . Before the king comes the herald , who has a trumpet . imitates trumpet <p> And the herald says , " Lift up your heads , o ye gates , so the great and mighty King may come in . " <p> And there 's a watchman on the wall . You played the part of the watchman on the wall . The watchman on the wall says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the King of glory ? " Okay ? <p> Then what happened ? When the identification was clear , and everybody knew who it was , the doors of the walled city would open , and the greeting committee came out to meet the king on the road where he was . Right ? <p> Then where did they go ? Did they just hunker down on the road and say , " You know , we 're enjoying meeting you out here on this dirty trail , here . Where shall we go from here ? Shall we go back where you came from , or shall we welcome him into the city ? " <p> Answer : They 're all going back into the city to party down . Are you with me now ? That 's a royal welcome . That 's how the welcome committee works . That 's the entrance liturgy . <p> It was well known throughout the ancient Near East . It 's mentioned in Psalm 24 and this is the image that Jesus uses . He says , " When Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cry of command . " <p> What is the cry of command ? In this case , " Wake up all you people . The king is coming to town . You need to come out and greet him . " <p> So where do they go and greet him ? They go and greet him in the air . Are you with me now ? They are greeting him in the air . Then the question is , where do they go from there ? <p> Not up into Heaven . They go back down to earth to rule with Christ on the earth . This is not about a Rapture into Heaven . It 's about meeting the Lord in the air and returning to reign with him on the earth . <p> After all , who were the first who got to meet the Lord ? Those who were raised from the dead . They get to go up first . The living go up second , and all God 's children reign with Christ upon the earth , and it has nothing whatsoever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero . Nothing . chuckling <p> There is n't a single church father in the second , or third , or fourth , or fifth or six centuries who thought it did and they knew the Greek New Testament before we even knew there was a Greek New Testament . <p> So , I 'm simply saying , this is wrong . It 's w-r-o-n-g . It 's not debatable . It 's not a matter of opinion . It 's wrong . Here at the end of the day , I feel like being a little emphatic . chuckling Are you getting the picture ? <p> Male 3 : Yes . <p> I 'm glad , because I do n't usually go to preaching . chuckling But you know ? This exercises me as they would say in England . This exercises me a little bit . <p> And here 's the problem . A text without a context is just a pretext for what you want it to mean . They do n't know the context . They do n't understand the epiphany of a king theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Let me tell you right now , the Thessalonians understood it . You know why ? They lived in a walled city . Guess who founded it ? Alexander the Great . It 's named after Alexander the Great 's sister , Thessalonike . <p> And they knew very well about welcoming kings , say , starting with Alexander . After that they welcomed Cicero . They welcomed Mark Anthony . They knew how to do up a party for a king . And they knew perfectly well what Paul was talking about - a royal welcome for King Jesus when He comes back . <p> They knew he was not talking about pre-tribulation Rapture . And so should we . Now what happens if you do n't have the escape clause ? What happens to your theology if you suddenly learn Christians in every age of church history have had to suffer , and some have been martyred ? <p> Why should we think that the last generation of Christians should be exempt from suffering before Jesus 's return ? What makes us special ? Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of Christians . <p> So , we are not exempt from this . Indeed , dear friends , our greatest honor would be to suffer for the sake of Jesus Christ and die in His name . These persons , says the author of Revelation , are the ones who conquer , and have a special place in Heaven . And it would be our highest honor to follow in their footsteps . That 's the truth . <p> One of the things I pray regularly when I 'm in dangerous places is , " Lord if it 's my time to go , let me be faithful to the last drop . " <p> And here 's where I tell you the story of Adoniram Judson and we 're going to call it a day . <p> Adoniram Judson was a great missionary to Burma . He went there and evangelized the tribes in Burma for 19 years with not single convert . I do n't know about you , but I do n't think I could do it . chuckling What do you think , Rob ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 years . Would it work ? I 'm thinking not . <p> And in the 19th year of his sojourn with people who did not understand , he was tied to a stake by one of the tribal chieftains who was sick and tired of hearing about King Jesus . They were about to have him for lunch . The tribal chieftain looked one more time into the eyes of Adoniram Judson and he said , " What do you think now of your God and your future ? " <p> And Adoniram Judson said in words that are famous , " The future is as bright as the promises of God . Go right ahead . " <p> And at that point , guess who blinked ? It was the tribal chieftain . That was the day that the door of the gospel was opened by that tribe and Christianity came to Burma . <p> We embark today . It 's a powerful story , but it reminds coughing us that when Jesus calls someone as Dietrich Bonhoeffer said , " He calls us to come and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Him . " <p> Do n't you understand that that was in the contract from day one ? In principle , you have given up your life . Brothers and sisters , I beseech you by the mercies of God to present yourselves as a living sacrifice , wholly and acceptable to God for this is your logical and spiritual worship . Think on these things and we 'll see you soon . God bless .

@@35723512 @4723512/ <h> Attributes of God : Communicable ( part 3 ) <p> Another passage showing God 's particular or discriminate love is Deuteronomy 7 where God tells Israel why he has chosen them and , of course , why he has not chosen them . <p> Deut 7:6 For you are a holy people to the Lord your God ; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth . <p> That is particularity . Of all the people on the face of the earth , I have chosen you . Why is that ? <p> Deut 7:7 The Lord did not set his love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples , for you were the fewest of all peoples , Deut 7:8 but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath which he swore to your forefathers , the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery , from the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you interpret this choosing of Israel , is affected a bit by your theology here in terms of covenant , dispensational , reformed and so on . I hold a view that when Paul says in Romans 11 that all Israel will be saved , he means all ethnic Israel . God will fulfill his promise to the people Israel . The reason I think this is true is because in the Old Testament God pledged to this ethnic people , of all the ethnic peoples of the world , I choose you to be my people . Paul raises the question in Romans 9 whether God failed in his promise ? The whole point of Romans 9 , 10 , and 11 is to say he has n't failed . He is going to do it . He is going to come through on his promise , and he going to save Israel . So that statement in Romans 11:26 , " and so all Israel will be saved , " is not a statement that you can generalize . You ca n't say all Americans will be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be saved . But you can say , because the Bible does , all Israel will be saved . People like to say this was just a choosing so that he could , through the Abrahamic Covenant , bring a blessing to the nation . Well he did bring a blessing to the nation , but still he set his love on ethnic Israel in a way that remains today distinct . He will do for ethnic Israel a saving work that is unique among the nations and the ethnic peoples of the world . This is particular love that God shows even here with the choosing of Israel . <p> We see that the love of God is complex and not simple . It is true , and at the same time there is a sense in which there is a universal love of God for all people . A passage like 1 Timothy 2:4 perhaps means this . I am not convinced that it does mean this , but perhaps it does mean that God really does desire all people universally , generally to be saved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely John 3:16 announces that God loves the world . <p> So there is this sense in which there is a universal general love of God for all people but also a special love for his own . A special love that chooses , saves , preserves and glorifies his own . I would encourage you to revel in the particular love that God has shown his own . If you are his , that includes you . It is an incredible thing when you think of that . It is very much like how a young women would feel at the privilege of having been chosen by this dashing young man to be his bride ; he chose her . There were other women , but he chose her . He really is a great guy , and really it is a privilege to have been chosen . The reason that analogy is apt is because this is the analogy of Christ and the church ; an analogy of the bride for the Son . So God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a marvelous thing . <h> 2 ) Grace <p> Grace can be defined as the unmerited favor of God by which he brings well being or goodness to those who are undeserving . Grace has in mind the object of God 's favor . He brings favor ; he brings well-being to those who do not deserve what they get . There is no merit that calls forth this favor . This is not payment ; this is not a wage . This is not earned . <p> As you look in Scripture , grace is used clearly in contexts that distinguish it from what is earned or merited or deserved . So it is undeserved , unmerited favor that is given to people . For example , Romans 3:24 . <p> Rom 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God , Rom 3:24 being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus <p> An interesting point is ( I have noticed this in a number of passages ) how often the word " gift " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you give a gift , it is not something that you have to do . It is something that you choose to do , and it benefits the other person , but it is undeserved ; it is unmerited . That is the point of it being a gift . It is not payment . It is not payback . It is a gift . <p> In some cultures this very difficult to understand . I remember my mother 's frustration . She held a Bible class for years in our home for Japanese women in Spokane , Washington where I grew up . There were a lot of Japanese families there who were part of Fairchild Air Force Base , and they would come to our church . My mother felt so badly for a number of these families because they were so poor . As they were leaving she would try to keep one of the ladies back a few minutes so it would n't be done in public , and she would give them some blankets or some clothing or a coat or something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same poor Japanese Christian woman would show at the Bible study with a gift of at least comparable value . My mother would just shake here head and say , " Please do n't do this . You are missing the point . I want to give you a gift . You do n't have to pay for this . " In some cultures it is difficult to accept the notion that it is a gift . I think it is for this reason that Jesus said it would be very difficult for the rich to inherit the kingdom of heaven ; it is like a camel going through the eye of a needle . Why is that ? It is because rich people are not accustomed to being given gifts that they did n't earn some way or another . They buy what they want ; they earn it . To acknowledge before God that I have nothing , absolutely nothing that can commend myself before you ; I am impoverished and there is no basis of merit by which I receive this is so insulting to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel of grace is that we have to acknowledge we can do nothing to merit or earn it . <p> Another famous passage is Ephesians the gift of God ; Eph 2:9 not as a result of works , so that no one may boast . <p> Notice the kicker at the end : so that no one may boast . God is jealous for his glory . He gets all the credit , every bit of it . This is one of the reasons that the Arminian doctrine of prevenient grace falters when weighed against the necessity that God receive all the glory for salvation . It is not a grace that leaves up to us which way it will go . It is a grace that gives to us the gift . We become recipients because of the grace . <p> A couple of other passages , Romans 5:15 and Romans 11:6 , show grace being God 's unmerited favor , undeserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not like the transgression . For if by the transgression of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the otherwise grace is no longer grace . <h> 3 ) Mercy <p> Mercy is the favor of God expressed to those who are needy , poor , helpless , hopeless . It is often times connected conceptually with the compassion of God , the mercy of God , his pity . God shows pity on people who are needy , empty , ruined , destitute . This is mercy . <p> There are some passages which show that the prevalent notion of mercy is this concept of favor to those who are in desperate condition . For example , in Ephesians 2 earlier in that chapter he talks about mercy before he brings up grace . Notice the context in the first three verses of Ephesians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of sin . That is crucial for understanding mercy . <p> Eph 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses even as the rest . <p> Look at this condition we are in . We are held hostage to sin . We are subject to its powers . We have no power over it . We are dead in our trespasses and sins . We stand before God deserving condemnation ; we are children of wrath . That is the condition we are in . This is not a pretty picture . There is nothing about this that indicates that we have any hope at all ; but God is rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his compassion , his kindness that he expresses to needy helpless , hopeless people . <p> Titus 3 is another place where you see mercy in the context of such clear need . <p> Titus 3:3 For we also once were foolish ourselves , disobedient , deceived , enslaved to various lusts and pleasures , spending our life in malice and envy , hateful , hating one another . <p> Here is the condition that we are in . This horrible destitute condition , slaves to our lusts and ruining our own lives and others . It is a horrible picture of what life is like for us . <p> Titus 3:4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared , <p> This is the concept of mercy , compassion , kindness . <p> Titus 3:5 He saved us , not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness , but according to his mercy , by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit , <p> So here you have it again . This kindness of God expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts of grace and mercy are simultaneously true in salvation . Because we , as the objects of God 's saving favor , are simultaneously undeserving and hopelessly , helplessly destitute . We are in need of grace because we do n't deserve the kindness of God . We ca n't merit it . We ca n't earn it . We ca n't do anything that would commend it , so we are in need of grace , and we are in need of mercy because we are ruined . We ca n't do anything . We are enslaved to sin . We ca n't break it . This is what Romans 7 is about . It is not about Paul the Christian . It is about the hold that sin has upon a person so that he can not break out of its clutches ; we are slaves to sin . Both come together in salvation . Actually , it is all three of these . It is God 's electing love that chooses to shower upon us favor . How is that favor shown ? It is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown to people who are helpless and destitute . So love , grace , mercy are all expressed in God 's saving of us from our sin . It is a marvelous thing . <h> b . Holiness <p> It may look like the holiness of God is the largest category as goodness is the most general and largest category that relates to the very nature of God . His nature is good . His nature is holy . It is good to be holy . Holiness is goodness . So these things are compatible . But holiness has its own special meaning . It has its own special substance . <p> Holiness could be defined as God 's eternal separation from all impurity or defilement . You hear in that definition two concepts that are involved . One is the concept of separation . The term holy means , at its most basic level , to be separate from or to be different from . It means to be one of a kind , unique , set apart . This is very helpful to see because there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral component , no impurity , no defilement , no immorality is absent yet we are talking about it being holy . How does this make sense ? For example , the Sabbath Day is holy to the Lord . If you ask the question , how can a day of the week be a moral entity ? Is it a morally pure day which is what makes it holy as opposed to Tuesday ? There is no day of the week that is more morally pure than any other because none of them is . It is not a category that applies to a unit of time , a day . It is a misplaced category to think in terms of morality . Why is the Sabbath Day holy ? Because , six days a week you work and on the seventh day you rest . It is unique . It is one of a kind . It is separate from the other days in terms of what it is . So it is a unique day . <p> Here is another example . The Israelites were told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear certain kinds of clothes . I am convinced all of us if you have not broken the food laws of the Israelites , you are presently at this moment breaking the clothing laws of the Israelites because you were not to wear a piece of clothing with two kinds of materials mixed together . No blends . One hundred percent wool only , one hundred percent cotton , so we are guilty . So why are they not supposed to do this ? What is the reason given for certain food laws , certain clothing laws ? For you are a holy people . And people have tried to make an argument in terms of eating that there really are certain kinds of foods that God knew would be impure for your body . What is the problem with that interpretation ? It contradicts the New Testament . Who in particular ? Peter . In Acts 10 , Jesus tells Peter to rise and eat ; Jesus pronounced all foods clean . It means that what was regarded under that dispensation as illegitimate is no longer that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself that was impure . Otherwise , what would it say now ? So it is not that . The reason Israel is called to just eat certain things and not others and wear just certain kinds of clothes and not others is because they are to be different . God wanted Israel to look different , act different , and be different than all the other nations of the world . So when they would see Israel they would say , " What a different people who serve a different God . " Holy people who serve a holy God . <p> So the core notion of holiness is the concept of being different . There is a sense in which this concept is popular in our culture at one level . Breaking out of the status quo and being your own person and this sort of thing . But have you ever noticed how this really works . You only want to be your own person if , as you do that , you look the right way to other people . In other words , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are just the same as the group of people you want to identify with . God wants us to be different in the way that he is different . He wants us to be set apart in the way that he is set apart . This is what it means to be holy : set apart as God is set apart , different in the way he is different . His standards become ours . What he loves , we prayerfully , meditatively seek to love . What he hates we prayerfully , meditatively seek to hate . Is n't it true that Christian people ought to grow in vibrant heart-felt hatred of sin , what stands opposed to God ? We ought not to wink at it . We ought not to laugh at it . We ought to despise it . This is being different as God is different . We have a long ways to go . So the first concept of holiness is separation . <p> The second concept is his moral purity . The way in which God is most fully manifest as different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite moral perfection God is eternally , immutably , unchangeably pure . This is why in Isaiah responded the way he did in Isaiah 6 with his vision of the Lord lofty and exalted , with the train of his robe filling the temple . <p> Is 6:3 And one called out to another and said , " Holy , Holy , Holy , is the Lord of hosts , the whole earth is full of his glory . " <p> Here is this scene with the loftiness of God , his grandeur and majesty , Seraphim are crying out Holy , Holy , Holy and how does Isaiah respond ? <p> Is 6:5 Then I said , " Woe is me , for I am ruined ! Because I am a man of unclean lips , and I live among a people of unclean lips ; for my eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts . " <p> It is that response from Isaiah that helps us realize that the holiness of God that he observed is not just his metaphysical difference from creatures . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaiah realized he had absolutely no place , so he is on his face , ruined . That sense of the very nature of God being infinitely , morally perfect and excellent is at the heart of holiness as well . So different , yes . Separate , yes . In particular , in his infinite moral excellence . <p> In talking about holiness , God has his natural standards of moral behavior , moral right and wrong . What else does it mean when you say God 's nature is infinitely morally excellent than to say God embodies what is right and rejects what is wrong . That is another way of saying that there are standards of right and wrong that make up the very fabric of God 's own nature . Laws of right and wrong that flow out of God 's nature are not arbitrary . They are not capricious . They are not ad hoc . They are not cultural relative . They are universal because they attach to the eternal nature of God who defines , who embodies moral rightness . <h> 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own nature of being holy is righteousness . Righteousness refers to God 's own perfect conformity to his own intrinsic moral law . Or God 's own nature is righteous in that it never violates in word , thought or action God 's intrinsic moral standards . The first statement is a positive statement ; it is God 's own perfect conformity to his own intrinsic moral law . The second way of putting it is a negative ; it never violates in word , thought or action God 's intrinsic moral standards . Both are true . It conforms to it ; it does n't violate it . <p> Righteousness is the holy nature of God in action . God 's nature is holy in action , whether that action is in word , in thought , or in deed . God in action always abides by the standards of his intrinsic moral nature . He never violates it . So when God speaks , he speaks out of an intrinsic moral nature that demands truth . When God speaks , he speaks truth . When God thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in conformity with his intrinsic moral nature . When God acts , all of his actions are done in conformity to this intrinsic moral nature . Catch the concept of the word " righteousness , " even as we have it English . It is right action , right word , right thought , right attitude . Righteousness is how right God is according to his standards in word , thought and action . God conforms absolutely . I thought of that this morning in a sermon from Dr. York with God telling Ezekiel that he would kill his wife . Ezekiel 24:16 " Son of man , behold , I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow ; but you shall not mourn and you shall not weep , and your tears shall not come . " It is not easy to understand this , but we have got to realize that God does not do something unjust when he takes her life . Because it is God 's prerogative to give life and to take it . We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near and dear to you , do not shake you finger at him and say this was not fair . What is fair is never having a moment of life or having had life receiving eternal condemnation . Raising our finger to God and demanding fairness is a fearful thing to do . So God 's actions are right when he commanded the Israelites to go into Canaan and wipe out all of the Canaanites . Everything God does , says , and thinks , every attitude of his heart is in conformity with that moral nature of his . <h> 2 ) Justice <p> Justice refers to two things . It refers to the fact that God establishes standards for his moral creatures that are in conformity to the standards of his own nature , and he judges his moral creatures by their conformity to those standards . <h> a ) Legislative Justice <p> Legislative justice refers to the fact that God establishes standards for his moral creatures that are in conformity to the standards of his own nature . In other words , God is the law giver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the executive branch of government . He establishes the laws for his moral creatures by which they are to live . The law of God is not negotiable ; it is not arbitrary ; it is not capricious . <p> Voluntarism view . God actually could have willed any law that he wanted to . If God had said you shall hate the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , mind and strength , that would have been good if God had willed that . They put the emphasis on the will of God . I find this vouluntarist view absolutely frightening in its implications because it means there is absolutely no moral bed rock absolute universal moral standard to anything , including God , in the universe . It is all relative . This is not the case . God 's nature is eternally what it is . God wills a law that conforms to his nature . The Ten Commandments are expressions of that moral nature of God . That is legislative justice . He gives a law that conforms with his nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being perfect . Psalm 119 extols the Law of the Lord . Romans 7:12 speaks about how the Law is holy , righteous and good . <p> The problem is not the Law . As Paul thinks about this he wonders how come when this law came and said , " Thou shall not covet , " there was in me all this coveting ? Was the problem the Law that announced to me the coveting ? No , the problem is not the Law ; the problem is me . The problem is my flesh . There was an incident when I was a grade school boy walking to school . The school I went to was about five blocks away , so I walked almost everyday . One day I was on my way to school and there was a portion of the sidewalk up ahead of me that they had just put down , so it was new cement . It was still wet and glistening . I honestly think that if there had n't been the sign , I would have walked around it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I approached it there was a string around the whole thing with a sign with bold letters . I think that is probably what got my attention . It said , " Do not walk on the wet cement . " So I said , " OK , I wo n't walk on the wet cement ; I 'll just run over it . " So I popped the little string and ran right though it on my way to school . Unfortunately the woman in the house saw this happen , and she called the cement people to come back and fix it before it became all hardened . I was in big trouble when I got home that night , as you might imagine . It is such a vivid illustration to me of what happens in my heart when I am faced with an altogether good and reasonable law that I do n't want to keep . The Law is perfectly good and righteous ; there is nothing wrong with the Law . The problem is my heart that does n't want to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that is Ezekiel 36 . " Moreover , I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you ; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh " ( Ezekiel 36:26 ) . The legislative justice is the giving of the law that good . <h> b ) Distributive Justice <p> He acts as judge . He is not only law-giver , but he is judge over those who have been given the law . That is the second half of the definition of justice . He judges his moral creatures by their conformity to the standards he has given them . He distributes justice . <p> In Galatians 6 you can see distributive justice along with both the remunerative and retributive sides of it in this one text . <p> Gal 6:7 Do not be deceived , God is not mocked ; for whatever a man sows , this he will also reap . <p> That is distributive justice . Whatever you sow , you will reap . God will judge . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , blessing you , rewarding you or punishing you for what you have done . He makes that clear in the verses that follow . <p> Gal 6:8a For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption , <p> That is retributive justice . This is what God will bring upon you : the punishment for one who sows to his own flesh <p> Gal 6:8b but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life . <p> This is what rewards will be given for following the Spirit . <p> Gal 6:9 Let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary . <p> Obviously , he means the reaping of the blessing . <p> Gal 6:10 So then , while we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , and especially to those who are of the household of the faith . <p> So God is the rewarder of those who obey him , and the one who punishes and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that sense , he is judge over all . God is then both the legislative and judicial branches ( of course , he also the executive branch as king ) . He provides the laws and upholds the laws as judge . <p> ( 1 ) Remunerative Justice <p> Remunerative Justice is God 's rewarding of those who obey his laws . <p> ( 2 ) Retributive Justice <p> Retributive Justice is God 's punishment to those who disobey his law . <p> Let me say one more thing on these attributes that relate to God 's moral nature . There has also been a tendency in the discussion of the attributes of God through history to think of all of his attributes as necessary qualities of his being . That is , if you know the distinction , it is an Aristotelian distinction between necessary predicates and accidental predicates , between necessary characteristics ( another word for predicate ) and accidental ( which are ones you can fail to have but still be what you are or who you are ) . This actually relates to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between necessary and essential and what are called accidental . It is a distinction you can conceive of very easily . Every one of you is made of necessary predicates and accidental predicates . For example , each of you has a soul . If you were to lose your soul , or if you failed to have a soul , would you be who you are ? No , that is a necessary or essential characteristic of who you are . But every one of you has fingernails , hair and some of you have facial hair , at least I do . If I go home and shave , would I be who I am ? My wife might not think so and my kids , but yes . You get a haircut , and you are still who you are . You can lose a finger in accident and you are still who you are . You ca n't lose your soul and still be who you are . There are necessary and accidental predicates . All that is to say that in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of God 's qualities are necessary . To put it differently , God has no accidental predicates . That is because God is eternal , and because God is immutable . You can just take those two things right there . He is eternal and immutable ; he is always the same . So obviously there ca n't be any accidental predicates if , in fact , you hold to eternity and immutability . But the minute you start talking about immutability involving a relational mutability ( God changing in relationship to us ) then you realize that you have to do something with the attributes . <p> I now hold a view that we ought to talk about attributes which are necessary and ones which are accidental ( ones that may not be , and yet God is still God ) . One of those I think is wrath . I think wrath is an accidental predicate . What if God , being God , never created a world , so there was no sin ? Do you want to say of God , who is the Triune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way you would say he is eternally holy or loving ? I find that a very strained notion . Rather , I think we should say that the wrath of God is an accidental predicate . That is , it is a quality that arises , that is occasioned by something in this world that he made , namely humans who sin . Yet it is a response of something out of his nature which is necessary and essential . What is that ? Holiness , justice , or at least righteousness . The righteous standards of God and his justice demands conformity to those standards . Those can be absolute essential predicates of God which give rise to wrath when those standards are violated . But , absent the violation , absent the sin , it seems very odd to me to say that God is eternally wrathful . <p> I think the very same thing is true of God 's mercy and grace . Mercy and grace are likewise elicited from God to those who are affected by sin . Why is it that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of God ? We are sinners . Why is it that we are helpless and hopeless ? It is that we are sinners . So the mercy and the grace of God is an expression of his essential quality of goodness . I think that love could be included with goodness as essential qualities of God that give rise to grace and mercy in certain situations . But , absent sin , absent the world as we have it , would you want to say God is eternally merciful ? If you think about , this is more troubling than if you say God is eternally wrathful . Because if God is eternally merciful , and there is no one else but God ( you got Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) , then who is the helpless , hopeless destitute one to whom mercy is being expressed ? Which member of the Trinity ? If God is eternally expressing of grace , who is the unworthy one to whom favor is given ? I think we have to think of grace and mercy as being expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his nature . Wrath , occasioned by sin , is an expression of his holiness and justice against sin . <p> I think that this is a helpful way to think about it . To have this category , to be able to invoke this category of accidental predicates will help on the whole question of God and time , as well . Because it means that God can be in time , involved in relationship with us and really can become angry or delight in someone 's repentance and bring mercy . God then is able to be involved in those kinds of responsive relational dispositions in his relationship with us , which is difficult to account for , if not impossible , if the only category you have for the characteristics of God is the category of essential predicates or necessary predicates . <p> You need to know this is fairly innovative because the church wanted to ensure God never changes . We have perfections , and it is here for keeps . There was such as desire to insure , to insulate God from any possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is timelessly eternal ; he is absolutely immutable . That does it ; he is locked in . But here is the problem . He is also locked out of real relationship with us . You have this problem of having the wrath of God in the category of essential attributes . <h> 3 . Attributes of God 's Rulership <h> a . Freedom <p> There has been a struggle in the church to understand the nature of God 's freedom . What is the nature of God 's freedom ? Is he free to be anything he wants to be ? This is along the lines of the Army appeal : be all that you can be ; be anything you want to be . Can God choose to be an omnipotent Satan ? Is he free to be evil ? Is he free to be anything he might choose to be ? There have been some in the history of the church called Voluntarists . Voluntarism is the belief that the will of God , if it truly is free , can not be constrained by anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is a function of his will . The fact that we have a God who is good and holy means we ought to wipe our brow and say , " Wow that was close one ; he could have chosen ... " If that is the case , then there is no moral absolute to the universe . Plus , it absolutely contradicts the notion in Scripture that God 's nature is eternally fixed . <p> So if you do n't go the Vouluntarist route and say that God will be anything he wants to be , then the other extreme of that would be Necessitarianism where you say God has to be just the way he is and can not will anything other than he does . It seems to me that this is a troubling notion to say that God was not free to create . If everything God willed had to be willed the way it was , then what about redemption ? I can remember reading a section in Karl Bath 's Dogmatics when he was talking about this necessitarian view and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , +Well you know it really was no big deal , was it ? Because after all , you had to do it ; it was necessitated. + " Is God free to create ? Is he free to redeem ? We have always wanted to say in the history of the church , yes , absolutely . <p> The middle position between these two I have given the name Essentialism . That is to say , the essence of God is absolutely fixed , but from within that essence he chooses whatever he wishes that is an expression of that essence which also includes his choosing to be what he eternally is . In other words , he continually chooses to be the holy God he is . I think his freedom is found in his simultaneously choosing to be who he eternally is , and out of that essence he chooses freely to create a world and to redeem lost sinners . All of the attributes we are talking about would be the set of essential characteristics of God . They would be his essence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it puts this discussion halfway between the Voluntarist which ends up totally relative and the Necessaritarian view in which God ends up totally restricted . This understands that it is the essence of God eternally which is the basis of all of his other choices that he makes as God . <h> b . Omnipotence <p> God is able to perform anything consistent with his nature . He is not free to violate his essence . He is free to do anything in accordance with that essence . Can God make a rock bigger than he can lift ? The answer is no . Any rock he can make he can lift . Does that mean he ca n't do something ? No . This is a trick question . It does n't mean that he ca n't do something ; it simply means there is nothing he ca n't do . There is no power bigger than his power . Can God die ? No , because he has the power always to sustain his life . God is able to do anything he chooses to do out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of logical possibilities . God is good not evil . We do not have the God of Shintoism with ying yang . We do not have God being good and evil , black and white , truth and error . That is a frightening view . This is a God who is good not evil , truth not error and that is the foundation for logic . He is the foundation for the law of non-contradiction . He is the foundation for all rationality . Try to think meaningfully about anything without the law of non-contradiction . If you disagree with me , you just proved my point . If you disagree you are saying , " No , it is not that ; it is this . " That is the law of non-contradiction that something can not be both and A and not A in the same way . God himself embodies the notion of logical consistency within his own being .

Communicable Attributes <p> We are in the section on the communicable attributes of God , which are to some measure , to some finite measure , true of us as well , true to at least a portion of the moral creation of God . <h> 1 . Intellectual Attributes <h> a . Omniscience <p> I talked with someone after class last period , and he was asking about Molinism , and I mentioned to him this way of breaking down those three kinds of knowledge that Molina used . There is necessary knowledge ( Molina 's term is natural knowledge ) , middle knowledge , and free knowledge . Natural knowledge is knowledge of all possibilities . Think of it as knowledge of what could be . There could be unicorns roaming the ranges in this world ; there could be three headed monsters . With what could be the possibilities are literally limitless . So God knows all that could be the case . Knowledge of the world as it ' ' will ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . So God knows all the +could be's+ and all the +will be 's , + that is , what will actually happen in this world . He knew from eternity past , before he created the world , that this particular grouping of students and individuals would be in this class at this moment in this time in history . God knew that this would be the case and what now is the case . Middle knowledge is knowledge of what would be . It is knowledge of what would be the case if such and such were different . He knows that you would have worn a warmer sweater today had the temperature been even lower than it is . He knows you would have come with a T shirt on if the temperature had been 40 degrees higher than it is today . God knows what would have been the case in any particular situation ; that is this category of middle knowledge . Natural knowledge is the knowledge of all possibilities and necessary truths . Middle knowledge is the knowledge of everything that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual world that God designed . It is called free knowledge because of all the possible worlds God could have created , he freely chose to create the world that will be just this way ; hence free knowledge . He freely chose to create this particular world and not another . <h> b . Omnisapience <p> Omnisapience is a term that you do n't hear very often in normal Christian parlance ; even theological language does n't invoke it very often . It is another omni attribute of God , in this case all wise . Sapiential literature , you may know from studying the Old Testament , is the study of the wisdom literature . So God is omnisapient ; he is all wise . I think that you would agree with me that there is a difference between knowledge and wisdom . Someone can be incredibly knowledgeable but not very wise . It is hard to reverse that . It is hard to conceive of someone who is very wise but knows very little . In fact , wisdom relies upon knowledge . If you know very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with your money in the stock market . But knowing a lot does n't necessarily mean that you are wise . You might think of wisdom as a certain use of knowledge . It depends upon knowledge ; it relies upon knowledge . It makes use of knowledge . Some people in defining wisdom have just stopped there ; wisdom is the use of knowledge to accomplish particular ends . But that is not quite good enough . Think , for example , of a vivid recent case where a sniper used a lot of knowledge about weapons , police activities , traffic patterns and all kinds of things . He used a lot of knowledge very cleverly to evade capture for quite some time . Would we call his actions wise ? Not on your life . We would call them evil , but it is the use of knowledge . <p> Wisdom has to be more than just the use of knowledge . It has to be a certain kind of use . It has to be the use of knowledge for particular kinds of ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is categorized under intellectual attributes because it ties so closely to knowledge , is actually a moral attribute as well because wisdom makes use of knowledge for good ends , for morally good ends . Think biblically . Is there any sense when talking about wisdom , biblically , that does n't advance the good ? No way . In the Bible wisdom is using knowledge for the advancement of good ends . <p> You also have to talk about means . It is n't just any means . If your church has a building program going on and that is a good end to give money to , it does n't justify going down to the bank and robbing the bank and giving all the money to the church . Though that is a good end ; you gave it all to the church for the building program . The means have to be just and good as well . <p> God 's wisdom is defined as the application of God 's infinite knowledge in a manner that accomplishes his morally perfect ends by the best means possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge " is an important concept in this whole discussion . Sometimes our plans falter ; they prove not to be wise because we lacked relevant information which , had we known , we would have decided differently . Just think of driving , of going from point A to point B. Had I known that there was an accident on the freeway I would n't have gone this way . If you never lack relevant information imagine the usefulness of your knowledge in using it to devise wise strategies . God+s wisdom is the application of his infinite knowledge in a manner that accomplishes his morally perfect ends by the best means possible . <p> In Scripture there are clearly a couple of actions of God that are spoken of more commonly as wise or as displaying God 's wisdom . They are creation and redemption . For example , in Psalm 104:24 God made all of his creation in wisdom . Proverbs 3:19 is similar . In relation to redemption , the strongest passage is 1 Corinthians 1 where Paul contrasts the work of God in the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of God . <p> 1 Cor 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world , through its wisdom did not come to know God , God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe . 1 Cor 1:22 For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom ; 1 Cor 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified , to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness the wisdom of God . <p> As you think about it , both of these actions , creation and redemption , are huge manifestations of wisdom and power simultaneously present and realized . When you think about wisdom and power being there for creation and being there for redemption you realize how important it is that while God is all wise , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather pathetic brilliant sage . Wisdom without power is pathetic . Power , unleashed , irresistible , unthwartable power lacking wisdom is fearful . It is absolutely frightening , sort of like an omnipotent Satan . We probably would n't live , but if we did we would live in never ending fear of what could happen , of what he might do , of what horrible thing he is devising . The beauty is that creation and redemption show these in such clear manifest ways . We have a God who is infinitely wise . It is a moral quality . His morally good or perfect ends are accomplished by the best means to do them , and he has all of the power to do them , so he is never thwarted in his purposes to accomplish what he chooses to do . <h> c . Truth <p> God is truth . A definition involves two aspects as you think of God as truth . One is that God knows all things as they are . In other words , he knows the truth about everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is never deceived ; he is never fooled by appearances . God knows the truth as it is . The second aspect is his Word in revelation is utterly reliable . God knows the truth as it is ; he knows all things as they are ; and his word in revelation is utterly reliable . A simple way to put this is God is the truth , and he speaks the truth . God is the truth ; God is truth ( 1 Jn 5:20 ) . He speaks the truth ; thy word is truth ( Jn 17:17 ) . <p> One aspect of this is the basis of our confidence that God is faithful . Think how important the faithfulness of God is ; think of his covenant keeping quality that Scripture extols . We sing " Great is Thy Faithfulness " and do it with gusto ; we sing it with a great deal of reassurance and confidence because God is truth . His faithfulness is founded upon the fact that he is , in himself , truth , and he speaks what is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says in two places ( Titus 1:2 and Hebrews 6:18 ) God can not lie . Another way to put that is God is so perfectly truth bearing , the embodiment of truth , that he expresses his own nature . His own nature is one of truth , so he speaks from his nature . What will he speak ? He will speak the truth . We never have to worry about God lying . He will always speak what is correct . God , in his grace and mercy , is working in our lives . <p> This then is a communicable attribute ; we are to be people who are truth bearers . We contain within ourselves increasing truth . " You shall know the truth " ( Jn 8:32 ) . We should live out the expression of what that means . " And the truth shall set you free , " Jesus says . Being like God is to be the freest , free from lying , free from deception , free from perversion , free from the kind of tricks and smoking mirror images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To know the truth is to be free . Sometimes I think that we Christian people just need to take God at his word that God 's perspective on things is right even when we do n't think so or feel like it is so . We live in a culture where feelings are huge . " Luke , keep your eyes closed , feel where you should go " ( from the Star Wars movie ) . We live in a culture that elevates feelings about things . The problem with this is that our feelings , as well as our thoughts , are deeply affected by sin , and they are not a good guide . They are not a true guide to how you ought to live your life or decisions you ought to make . So sometimes we just have to go with what God says . Sin can even twist and distort our ways of thinking so that we can start thinking that what God says is wrong and what we think is right . That can happen . One of the most sobering things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people did what was right in their own eyes . " That is much more fearful than people doing deliberately , intentionally what is wrong in their own eyes , but they do it anyway . At least then they know it is wrong . This is worse . This is the pro-choice advocate who believes that advocating aborting fetuses is right , that working for the civil liberties of homosexuals is right . Christian people can get trapped in this same thing . We can get trapped into thinking what is in fact is wrong is right and we do n't even know it . How do we guard against this ? You ca n't trust your feelings ; you have got to go with God 's word . You have to . Be people of the Book . Be people who meditate and who read . Before God , acknowledge your own propensity to read right and wrong from our experiences and our feelings and say , " God deliver me , God help me to see the truth as it is , help me to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is where freedom is. <h> 2 . Moral Attributes <p> There are two broad categories in the moral nature of God . The first I think the best name to use for this category is " goodness . " The other one is " holiness . " It looks to me that there are moral attributes of God that are best seen as fitting in these two broad categories . These are not conflicting categories . This is not Ying and Yang or black and white . These are categories that are mutually reinforcing . The easiest way to see that , for example , is that to live holy is to experience the good . Or to put it differently , true goodness is found in the living out of holiness . So these are not contradictory categories by any means , but they do have different emphases and within them certain attributes that attach in each of these . <h> a . Goodness <p> Goodness can be understood as the intrinsic disposition of God by which he seeks to show kindness and want the well-being of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there over God and say , " Now , you be good . " We have to do that with one another ; parents with kids certainly have to do that in a variety of different ways because of our sinful natures . Nobody has to make God be good . He is intrinsically good . Another way to think of it is there is no goodness other than God 's . Whatever else is good in this world is good by virtue of its derivation of God 's goodness . We have derivative goodness ; God has intrinsic goodness . There is a huge difference . The only goodness there is , is God 's goodness . If we share in it , it is because God has shared it with us . We have derivative goodness and he has intrinsic goodness . This intrinsic goodness is a goodness that seeks the well-being of others . It is intrinsically inclined toward their welfare . So God is good . <p> Now think of God prior to creation , can you still speak of God as a good being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Within the trinity there is goodness expressed . Father , Son and Holy Spirit are in this social relationship in which goodness is expressed . There is an intrinsic disposition to show kindness to another , Father to Son to Holy Spirit in this joyous Trinitarian social relationship . But when God creates , he creates a world and his own nature is one that inclines him toward goodness . <p> Ps 119:68 You are good and do good ; teach me your statutes . <p> God is good and he gives good to others . In the context of Psalm 119 you can guess what the good gift is that he gives to others . Psalm 119 is about God 's word that he gives as an expression of his goodness to others . His Law , the Law of the LORD is good . <p> A parallel text , one that I have thought of many , many times is when Moses summarizes the moral commandments to the people of Israel before they enter the promised land and he comes to his summation in Deuteronomy 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord your God require from you , but to fear the Lord your God , to walk in all his ways and love him , and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul , Deut 10:13 and to keep the Lord 's commandments and his statutes which I am commanding you today for your good ? <p> If we could help our children grow up with constant reminders that the ways of the Lord are for their good it would help battle what the world is constantly telling them , that some kind of ungodly sinful behavior is good for them . Temptation works precisely because the woman looked at the tree and it was good for food , it was a delight to the eyes and it would make one wise . This is how temptation works . It presents a false claim with glitter and balloons and banners and tinsel and candy coating . It says , " Here is good . " But it will kill you . God presents good , and it is the real thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make known to me the path of life ; in your presence is fullness of joy ; in your right hand there are pleasures forever . <p> God is not bashful about making it clear . You come to me and you get good ; you go anywhere else and you make your broken cisterns . ( Jeremiah 2 ) <p> Jer 2:13 For my people have committed two evils : They have forsaken me , the fountain of living waters , to hew for themselves cisterns , broken cisterns that can hold no water . <p> What is the key to understanding the anthropology , the psychology of why people would leave a fountain of living water for dry broken cisterns ? ( Remember , this is Israel ; it is dry , barren , not much water , it+s hard to come by , a rare commodity ; water is precious stuff . ) The key to that passage that explains this behavior , that explains your behavior and mine every time we succumb to temptation is in the words , " To hew for themselves cisterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did it my way . This is the theme song of Hell . It is the epitome of sin ; I did my way . So God wants us know that good is found in him . If we could learn that , how we would resist temptation . If any of you men are struggling with pornography , until you are convinced that walking a life of purity , living life before God , pursuing him and his holiness , until you are convinced that is the surpassing value ( to use the language of Philippians 3 ) you will go back to that website , you will find that magazine and you wo n't break it because , in you soul , you are convinced that is where good is . This is the only way to break it . Pardon the little sermonette here , but it is true . <p> Thomas Chalmers , the Scottish minister , preached in the 17th and 18th centuries . He preached hundreds of sermons . He was a politician turned preacher , turned pastor . The one sermon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power of a New Affection . " The point of the sermon is very simple ; if you want to remove worldliness , remove sinfulness from a person , it wo n't do to simply try to push it out . He says this is what we do most often by telling ourself how bad this is . Committing adultery would be a horrible thing this to my marriage , my family , my ministry ; it would just ruin me . It is not wrong to think those things ; it helps , but it wo n't do it . If you have eyes for a woman who is not your wife , those things you will begin to rationalize very quickly . You will figure there are ways to get away with this without incurring the consequences . You will talk yourself into doing it anyway . So trying to remove this temptation by focusing on the negative things wo n't work . So he suggests the expulsive power , what pushes this out , is a new affection which is greater , more potent , and weightier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater value that now you attach to the new affection . An analogy would be if you have a glass of water , you can empty it a variety of different ways . You can siphon the water out ; you can drink it ; you can pour it out . In all these ways , you leave a glass empty . Glasses do n't mind being empty . We have glasses in our cupboard that have never been used in our 23 plus years of marriage and I have never heard a complaint . I 've never walked by this cabinet in the dinning room and heard , " fill me , fill me , " from these glasses . These glasses do n't mind being empty , but people do ; people mind it very much . So you push pornography out of your life saying , " I 'm not going to do that anymore , not going to go there . " So you have this resolve that you are not going to do that . If you leave yourself empty , you will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You cry out I want to be filled . So you have to be filled . There is another way to empty water out of a glass : by filling it with something weightier , let 's say liquid mercury . You pour liquid mercury into a glass of water , as the mercury rises and fills the glass the water is expelled ; the expulsive power of a new affection . So fill yourself with something weightier , namely God , his word , Christ , his beauty . Fill your life with him , and the crude has no place anymore . This is how it works . Try it the other way , and you will be working at this your entire life ; it will never end . <p> All of this is to say God is good . We have to believe this . I am absolutely convinced that people who do not believe the fundamental goodness of God will never really truly obey him . We have this instinct , a God given instinct , a drive to go for what is good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord is good ( Ps 34:8 ) . He is like a vender at a grocery store that has all their stuff out there , saying , +Try this ! + Come and taste and see that the Lord is good . He is not embarrassed for you to know that if you go to him you will find goodness . He wants you to know this . If you are not convinced of it you will go somewhere else that you think goodness can be found . You will because it is your nature to want to have goodness , hence the appeal . Taste and see that the Lord is good . In that appeal God assumes something about you which is the basis for the appeal . The assumption is that you ' ' want ' ' good , you ' ' want ' ' blessing . Otherwise , what is the point ? <p> Ps 34:8 O taste and see that the Lord is good ; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in him ! <p> If God does n't assume we want blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is we do ; we do want blessing . We want goodness ; we want fulfillment ; we want satisfaction . Why do we want all of those things ? Because God made us with this inner drive to want those things because he wanted to be the one who would satisfy them . As they are satisfied then we give thanks and glory to God . God is glorified most in us because we have been satisfied so deeply in him . We boast about that which fills us . We boast about things which satisfy us . Be satisfied in God and worship happens . <p> God wants us to know he is good . There is hardly anything more pastorally relevant for your life and for your people than for you and they and I to become increasingly convinced there is one place to find goodness , joy , fulfillment , satisfaction , and pleasure ( Ps 16:11 In my presence there is fullness of joy , at my right hand there are pleasures forever more ) .

We dare not think that goodness stands on its own apart from holiness and the attributes that are attached to it . <p> Rom 2:4 Or do you think lightly of the riches of his kindness and tolerance and patience , not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance ? <p> Rom 11:22 Behold then the kindness and severity of God ; to those who fell , severity , but to you , God 's kindness , if you continue in his kindness ; otherwise you also will be cut off . <p> There are three different biblical terms , biblical attributes of God which are expressions of his goodness . They are not identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are very prominent conceptions that have to do with the expression of God 's intrinsic disposition to show kindness , favor , and well-being to others . <h> 1 . Love <p> I talked about this briefly when we talked about the self sufficiency and the love of God . I will give a short review of what was said there . There are two main terms for the love of God in Scripture . In the Old Testament , the term is ' ' hesed . ' ' The term ' ' hesed ' ' contains two concepts together . One is loyalty , covenant faithfulness , and promise keeping . The love of God most vibrantly , lavishly manifested is a love which is loyal , faithful , and true . The other element is kindness , well-being , and enhancing one 's good . Putting the two together ' ' hesed ' ' communicates God 's commitment to bring good to others . It is his commitment , his loyalty in bestowing favor , kindness , well being . It is translated variously and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not have such a lousy translation . ' ' Hesed ' ' is translated in the NASB as loving kindness . A better translation is in the ESV . It says steadfast love . Loyal love would also be a good translation . Loyal love , covenant keeping love , steadfast love is the ' ' hesed ' ' of God . To see how your translation translates it , look at Psalm 106 in verse one . <p> Ps 106:1 Praise the Lord ! Oh give thanks to the Lord , for he is good ; for his lovingkindness is everlasting . <p> In Psalm 136 you see it used in the refrain all the way through the Psalm . <p> Ps 136:1 Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good , for his lovingkindness is everlasting . Ps 136:2 Give thanks to the God of gods , for his lovingkindness is everlasting . <p> The New Testament word for God 's love is ' ' agape ' ' . It refers to an unconditional nature of God 's love , not a +because of+ love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because you are gifted , because you are rich , because of anything . It is rather an +in spite of+ love . While we were enemies God loved us and gave his Son to die for us . <p> 1 Jn 4:10 In this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins . <p> The love of God in this broad sense is his unconditional loyal commitment to bring about good to others . <p> I want to recommend to you the book that Don Carson wrote , ' ' The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God ' ' . I am so glad somebody who is capable of doing that and certainly Don Carson is , wrote this book because I have taught on this for years and I have never been able to refer people to something that articulated this and he does it so well . Carson shows that the love of God in the Bible is complex not simple . It does n't just mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all people everywhere . It does mean that in some instances . I think John 3:16 is a very likely candidate for that understanding . <p> Jn 3:16 " For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish , but have eternal life . <p> God so loved the world , I do n't think that can rightly be limited or restricted to a portion of humanity . I think that ought to be understood as the whole , entire human race ; everyone who has lived or ever will live . God loved the world . Here is the universal love of God for all people . <p> Many Christian people make this mistake that Don Carson talks about in this book . That is , the mistake of thinking that this is the love of God period . This is all there is in the Bible teaching about God 's love ; it universal and impartial ; it is freely bestowed on all people equally . If you want to be true to Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you some examples of the love of God that is particular , not universal . It is a love whose particularity is up to God . We can not say that , " He ca n't love them because they refused it ; they rejected it . He is trying ; he wants to love them ; he is out there seeking to love them . " It wo n't work in these passages . They speak of a love of God that is particular , and the particularity is owing to God 's decision . One clear example of this is Romans 9:13 . People who hold to the universal view of God 's love honestly do n't know what they are doing . I suppose they wish this verse were n't in the Bible . But it is and if we are going to be true to the Word of God then we can+t ignore it . This is not an isolated case ; I am giving it to you right now as a clear cut example of this other category . <p> Rom 9:10 And not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had conceived twins by one man , our father Isaac ; Rom 9:11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , so that God 's purpose according to his choice would stand , not because of works but because of him who calls , Rom 9:12 it was said to her , " The older will serve the younger . " Rom 9:13 Just as it is written , " Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . " <p> Romans 9:13 is quote from Malachi 1:3 . Even if you take this passage in the most kindness , gentleness way possible you have to conclude there is a discrimination . Even if you translated it , +Jacob have I loved , but Esau I have loved less , + ( which is a far cry from hated , but is a good translation because it aptly reflects what God said to Esau in Malachi 1:3 ) , you must see that there is a discrimination . It is sort of like I say to my daughter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street I love them , too . " I do , but do n't . I love Bethany my daughter differently than I do the neighbor kids down the street ? You bet I do . I am paying for her college ; I am not paying for theirs . To make it more vivid , I say to my wife , " Jodi , I love you . " Are we not called to love everyone ? What If I said to Jodi , " I love you just the same way I love all women . " How do you think this is going to go over with my wife ? We do discriminate in love . Here this is discrimination . However the contrast is not love and love less ; it is love and hate . Look in Romans 9:11 so that you can see the particularity of the love owing to what God decides . <p> Rom 9:11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , so that God 's purpose according to his choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him who calls , <p> Is n't he laboring the point that this is not because Jacob was such a great guy and Esau was a jerk ? No it will not work , for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad , it was God 's choice . So that God 's purpose according to his choice would stand , it was said to her , " The older will serve the younger . " So God chooses to violate the law of prima genitor , the favoritism shown to the eldest born . He can because he is God . He wants to choose the younger ; he will choose the younger . <p> I really think that one of the most important steps Christian people have to come to in their pilgrimage , in their growth in life is realizing that part of what God uses to define himself as God is , +I decide not you . I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion ; I will show mercy on whom I show mercy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he decides . Here is a vivid point . Before the two were born , before ether had done anything good or bad , God chooses . +I decide , I say , +Jacob , you are the younger , you are going to be treated as the older . Esau you are the older one , you are going to be treated as the younger. + I am going to love Jacob and I am not going to love Esau. + <p> Anything I am going to teach you which you believe is not in accordance with the teaching of the word of God 1 ) do n't believe it , and 2 ) you have every right to challenge the teaching . You have every right before God to believe what you are convinced Scripture teaches . I just want you to know that I am someone standing before you who is very much aware of my mandate to endeavor before God to be faithful to his word . I can fail at that . If I fail , call me on it . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or comfy . Nor am I interested , on the other hand , in making up a bunch of stuff that is uncomfortable because we ought to feel uncomfortable . I am not interested in either one of those things . I want , by God 's grace , to be faithful to his Word . This means , for most of us , we are going to have to make adjustments on how we think about a lot of things if we really do settle on accepting what Scripture teaches . This is one of those areas where it is a whole lot easier to just say God loved everyone and what that means is it is always the same , it is impartial ; it is universal . He never shows favorites ; the only reason that anyone does n't receive the love of God is because they reject it . That plays well . People like hearing that . But is that faithful to the Word ? My answer is no it is not . It may be faithful to this text or that text , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . <p> Mal 1:1 The oracle of the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi . Mal 1:2a " I have loved you , " says the Lord . But you say , " How have you loved us ? " <p> This is how the book of Malachi is organized : It is organized with these challenges from the people that God answers . So here the first challenge is , you claim you loved us , how have you loved us ? <p> Mal 1:2 " I have loved you , " says the Lord . But you say , " How have you loved us ? " " Was not Esau Jacob 's brother ? " declares the Lord . " Yet I have loved Jacob ; Mal 1:3a but I have hated Esau , <p> Do you see that this sense of the love of God is meaningless without the particularity ? If you make the love of God equal to Jacob and Esau it does n't just change the conception ; it totally eliminates the conception of love in this text . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has done for him but what he has chosen not to do or chosen to do negatively toward his brother Esau . So he has given Jacob a favored status against his brother Esau and in this is his love , in this the particularity . <p> Mal 1:2b " How have you loved us ? " " Was not Esau Jacob 's brother ? " declares the Lord . " Yet I have loved Jacob ; Mal 1:3 but I have hated Esau , and I have made his mountains a desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness . " <p> How much has God despised Esau ? Enough so that his entire inheritance will not stand ; it will be destroyed . <p> Mal 1:4 Though Edom says , " We have been beaten down , but we will return and build up the ruins " ; thus says the Lord of hosts , " They may build , but I will tear down ; and men will call them the wicked territory , and the people toward whom the Lord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God how have you loved us ? " And the reply is , " I have hated your brother . And in contrast look at you - favored , blessed , called , chosen . " <p> The point of this is to say that the love of God , in some passages , has to do primarily with the love of God for his own , for his chosen ; it is a love that is particular . It is a love that chooses to lavish upon them enormous blessing and chooses not to give that blessing to others , or worse chooses to bring them to destruction . <p> Isaiah 43 is a passage that is often times read , but a portion of it is skipped over because it is n't pleasant . But the first part of it and other parts are wonderfully comforting . <p> Is 43:1 But now , thus says the Lord , your Creator , O Jacob , and he who formed you , O Israel , " Do not fear , for I have redeemed you ; I have called you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . When you walk through the fire , you will not be scorched , nor will the flame burn you . Is 43:3a " For I am the Lord your God , the Holy One of Israel , your Savior ; <p> This is normally where you quit reading or skip down to the next part . But look what comes next . <p> Is 43:3b " I have given Egypt as your ransom , <p> That is a reference to the Exodus . <p> Is 43:3b " I have given Egypt as your ransom , Cush and Seba in your place Is 43:4 " Since you are precious in my sight , since you are honored and I love you , I will give other men in your place and other peoples in exchange for your life . <p> He is saying , +When I saved you , I showed my loved to you , what did I do to the Egyptians ? I brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did I not show you that you were precious in my sight , that I honored you , that I loved you and look what I did to the Egyptians . I opened up the Red Sea for you to cross through on dry ground , and every one of you made it . You get to the other side , the Egyptian army is coming after you , and they will kill you if they get to you , so what do I do ? I bring the waters back over them . Their chariot wheels began to act in unusual ways , they ca n't drive them straight they are unable to get from the middle of that Red Sea as the waters come back upon them and every single Egyptian soldier dies . I have given Egypt in your place Israel . " <p> I appeal to you to think hard about this , this is the love of God . <p> When you have this in mind think of Ephesians 1 , for example , verses 3 heavenly places in Christ , Eph 1:4 just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and blameless before him . In love Eph 1:5 he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself , according to the kind intention of his will , Eph 1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved . <p> Do you realize the predestination verses ( 5 and 6 ) are bracketed with love ? +In love he predestined us .... in the Beloved. + Now maybe the phrase +in love+ goes with the previous statement of election ; it could be ; it is hard to know . Conceptually you could have elected in love , and predestined in the Beloved . But the point is this : this is love for his own . He chose some , not others . You try to make this into universal love , and it is like me saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world the same way . " It means nothing then when I say , " Jodi , I love you . " If you turn that statement of a husband to a wife into a universal impartial love for all people equally then it means nothing . God tells you if you are his child , " I love you . " Do you know what that means ? It means he chose to love you and chose not to love others . This is what Scripture teaches .

The Canon and the Text of the New Testament How and why were the books in the New Testament chosen to form the canon we have today ? The three major criteria are that the writings be uniquely relevant , non-contradictory with previously acknowledged revelation and genuinely going back to an apostle or close associate of an apostle . The four Gospels have similarities and differences in their content and writing style . Matthew , Mark and Luke have so many similarities that they are called the synoptic Gospels . John is significantly different in content and style from the other three . <p> 5 . A Harmony of the Gospels ( Part 1 ) By comparing the texts of the Gospels , we can trace the major periods , activities and teachings of Jesus ' life .

Second Thessalonians and First Corinthians A major theme in Second Thessalonians is " the Day of the Lord . " There are common themes and teachings in First and Second Thessalonians . First Corinthians emphasizes the themes of Jesus ' death and resurrection , as well as the importance and use of spiritual gifts , and how we conduct ourselves in relation to those who are pursuing Christ and those who are not . <p> 10. 2 Corinthians and the Prison Epistles The outline and summary of the content of Second Corinthians includes themes like financial stewardship and Christians being " ambassadors of reconciliation .

@@35723542 @4723542/ <h> Early Life of Jesus <p> Template:Jesus Navigation <h> The early life and ministry of Jesus Christ <h> Summary of method <p> It is impossible to produce a biography of Jesus as understood by the modern use of that term . Since Christianity is a historic religion , it is essential to provide at least an outline of the main events which went to make up His earthly life . It will be valuable by way of introduction to give a summary of the main stages of the story as it can be reconstructed from the gospels . <h> The thirty years in Nazareth <p> Although this lasted for so many years , the material preserved is confined to the birth stories and one brief incident when Jesus was twelve . <h> The period of preparation <p> This covers the ministry of John the Baptist in heralding the coming of Christ . <h> The Judaean ministry <p> This includes the earliest period of the Lord 's work until the commencement of the Galilean ministry . <h> The Galilean ministry <p> This section may be divided for convenience into three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve , the second with the withdrawal of Jesus from northern Galilee and the third with His departure for Jerusalem on His last journey . <h> The closing period of the ministry <p> This is a convenient heading for the material fitted into the journey to the time when Jesus enters Jerusalem mainly centered beyond Jordan . <h> The passion and resurrection narratives <p> Under this caption are included all the events from the entry into Jerusalem until the Resurrection and the various post-resurrection appearances of Jesus to His disciples , culminating with the Ascension . <p> In the following outline of events and teaching , it is intended to fill out in considerable detail these main stages to bring into focus the major purpose of Jesus . It is important to recognize that the theology of Jesus is seen both in His acts and in His teaching . An over-concentration on one or the other would have been a mistake . They are inextricably linked . The many deeds of compassion , the demonstrations of power , the human interest , are all part of the total picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time the teaching throws light upon the true nature and interpretation of the acts . Nevertheless , in the outline itself the emphasis will be on the events , since a separate section will deal with the teaching , both in method and content . <h> The thirty years in Nazareth <p> The most important part of this preliminary section of the life of Jesus is His advent into human life . It is for this reason that Matthew and Luke begin with narratives relating to the birth of Jesus , while John goes back and reflects upon His eternal pre-existence . One would not expect the story of Jesus to begin where John begins , for he sets the scene beyond the realm of history . Nevertheless , by reason of what the evangelists believed Jesus to be , his is the most logical beginning . <p> At first glance it seems strange that John should introduce his book with statements about the Word , esp . as he does not identify the Word as Jesus Christ until toward the end of the prologue . Evidently the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing , otherwise his opening would have been more mystifying than elucidating . One can not now be certain of its source for John . Philo of Alexandria has much to say about the Logos , which in his system was an intermediary principle between God and man , but he denied the possibility of the Logos becoming flesh . When John says that the Logos did become flesh he is clearly presenting a different kind of Logos from Philo . For all his great erudition , Philo could not present a Logos capable of dwelling among men , who could move men into action and give power to men to become sons of God . This was a new element in the contemporary Gr. world . Jewish thought had also prepared for the coming of Jesus , not only with the Messianic hope , but by its concept of the intermediary Memra , God 's agent in the world of creation . <p> Far more important than the origin of the idea of the Word are the statements concerning Him which John makes in his prologue . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . His power is evidence of His creative energy and of His re-creative activity . The Word is identified as Light shining in an atmosphere of darkness , which describes the moral environment into which Jesus came . The Word becoming flesh is pivotal to John 's introduction to his gospel . The whole account is basically a human and historic story , because the becoming flesh had taken place among men and the glory of the incarnate Word had been seen . There is an unquestionable connection between the prologue and the events that follow . The same Jesus Christ , whose actions and words are recorded is the means whereby grace and truth come to men , and through whom God makes known His revelation . Unless the records of all the gospels are seen in the light of this mission , there can be no proper evaluation of the life of Jesus . <p> One significant feature about John 's introduction is the mention of John by name , the witness to the Light , before the Light had Himself been identified . This shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry of John the Baptist . <p> John 's statement that the Word became flesh at once raises the question in what circumstances it happened . Matthew and Luke supply the answer . The narratives , although brief , are nevertheless sufficient to establish the historical reality of the Incarnation . There is a restraint about them that immediately impresses . Matthew approaches the subject from a different point of view than Luke , and yet their narratives are complementary to each other . Both stress the supernatural character of the advent of Jesus . In Matthew this is brought out by the narration of several dreams which reveal various stages of development , from the announcement of Joseph 's reaction when he learns of Mary 's pregnancy until the return from Egypt . In Luke 's account a similar impression is created by the angel 's announcement to Mary . It is at once clear that this is no ordinary birth . It is not surprising therefore that Matthew records a citation that a virgin would conceive ( Matt 1:23 ) . It is true that Isaiah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman , but it is equally evident that Matthew intended the readers to understand that the advent of Jesus was effected in a miraculous way by conception taking place in a virgin . Luke 's account supports this in the promise to Mary that the Holy Spirit should come upon her ( Luke 1:35 ) . <p> It is never suggested in these narratives or anywhere else in the gospels that people generally regarded Jesus as any other than the son of Joseph ( cf. John 6:4 ; Matt 13:55 ; Luke 2:27 , 41 , 43 ) . Popular opinion is no sure guide to truth , and both Matthew and Luke have set out to stress the uniqueness of the birth of Jesus as a necessary prelude to their accounts of His life and ministry . Whatever modern attempts may be made to approach the life of Jesus from a purely human point of view , it is beyond dispute that the evangelists made no such attempt . <p> In Matthew 's gospel the Annunciation is made to Joseph and the most characteristic feature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the advent . Jesus was coming to save His people from their sins ( Matt 1:21 ) . At the beginning of the gospel a theological note is introduced . The subsequent doings of Jesus are all geared to this purpose , which provides their motive force . <p> In Luke 's gospel the Annunciation is to Mary and is accompanied by an account of the promise of the birth of John the Baptist and its fulfillment . The most significant feature of this account is the inclusion of the hymns known as the Magnificat and Benedictus , both of which are formed on the pattern of the OT Psalms . They create an atmosphere of rejoicing over the coming of Jesus that is frequently reflected in the subsequent narrative , for Luke 's account has more references to joy than any of the others . <p> The story of the angel 's announcement to the shepherds draws attention to the same feature . The day of the advent of Jesus was a day of good tidings of great joy . At the same time , the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good will , which gives a distinctly universal aspect to the purpose of Jesus . The mission of Jesus could never be understood against a background of narrow nationalistic aspirations . It needed a broader canvas . The homage of humble shepherds signifies something of the receptivity of the common people , a feature which was to be abundantly illustrated in the subsequent ministry of Jesus . <p> Matthew 's account of the homage of the wise men presents a rather different aspect . These were Gentile inquirers for the coming Christ . They believed themselves to have been divinely led , and indeed through being supernaturally warned of Herod 's devices were able to frustrate his intention to take adverse action against the child Jesus . This homage of Gentiles is specially noteworthy at the beginning of a gospel which is primarily written with Jewish interests in mind . The Messiah was not so Jewish that Gentiles had no desire to worship Him , and in harmony with this is the conclusion of this same gospel , in which the commission of Jesus to His disciples is world-wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise men arrived at the place where Jesus was . Some think it was a considerable time after His birth , a view based mainly on the evidence that Herod sought to kill all the children under two years old . Herod did not know how long ago the child had been born . He knew only when the star appeared . The flight into Egypt , recorded only in Matthew 2:13 , 14 , is seen as a direct fulfillment of prophecy . This therefore plays an important part in Matthew 's purpose , i.e. , to show that the course of the life of Jesus was no accidental happening , but a designed fulfillment of what God had foretold . <p> In the meantime , Jesus was present at the Temple for circumcision when eight days old , according to Jewish custom ( Luke 2:22ff . ) . On this occasion Simeon and Anna both bore witness to Jesus . Simeon 's song ( Nunc Dimittis ) again conveys a universal viewpoint , for Jesus was to become a Light for Gentile illumination ( 2:32 ) as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simeon foresaw hostility toward Jesus , for some would speak evil against Him ( 2:34 ) . Both Simeon and Anna typify the realization of the fulfillment in Jesus of long awaited Messianic hopes . The story of the ministry of Jesus is intended to be read against such a background . <p> Both Matthew and Luke include genealogies . Matthew uses one to introduce his gospel , tracing the list from Abraham to Jesus . Luke , who does not refer to the genealogy until after recording the ministry of John the Baptist ( Luke 3 ) , begins with Jesus and traces His ancestry back to Adam . Although some of the names in these two genealogical lists are the same , most of them are not . A partial explanation may be found in the schematic arrangement adopted by Matthew , having three groups of fourteen names ( Matt 1:17 ) . This is made possible only by various omissions . It has been suggested that whereas Matthew follows the lineage of Joseph , Luke follows Mary 's , but this supposition seems to run counter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention Mary . It is impossible to tell either the sources of these genealogies or the extent to which either author depended upon his own investigations . The major contribution of both lists for the life of Jesus is clear enough " both trace the ancestry through David and Abraham . He came of a royal line which gave rise to the title Son of David , which was used by various people in the course of the narrative . <p> Of all the evangelists it is only Luke who makes any attempt to set the record of Jesus on the stage of secular history . Even he concentrates on the timing of the appearance of John the Baptist rather than on the appearance of Jesus , although he shows the two events to be inseparable . The dating is sixfold ( Luke 3:1 , 2 ) and points to the major political figures in the Jewish world . This note of Luke 's is of great importance in establishing the historical setting of Christianity . <p> One other contact with secular history which is mentioned by Luke , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which is said to be the occasion for Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem just prior to the birth of Jesus . There is known to have been a census held under this official in a.d. 6 , but this would be too late for the birth of Jesus . There is some reason to think that an earlier census was held in Syria more approximate to Luke 's chronology , but the difficulty of Quirinius still remains , unless , as Sir William Ramsay supposed , this official held an extraordinary command at the same time as the governorship of Varus . <p> Contrary to the modern idea of biographical studies that seeks traces from the early years of influences which contributed to the later development of a character , none of the evangelists shows the slightest interest in early environmental factors . Luke alone mentions an incident during the thirty years that Jesus spent in Nazareth . The visit to the Temple when Jesus was twelve was no doubt included to draw attention to the fact that in the home of Jesus the usual Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish boys attended the Passover feast . For Luke it had more significance than this because of the opportunity it afforded to illustrate Jesus ' first contact with the Temple teachers . <p> The incident not only reveals their amazement at the wisdom of Jesus , but also His own consciousness of a divine mission , which His family did not understand . They evidently were incapable of appreciating His fullness of wisdom and His possession of special divine grace ( 2:40 ) . Mary appears to have understood most , but she kept her reflections to herself ( 2:51 ) . She must have wondered often at the grace with which He was subject to her . The restraint of the canonical account of the childhood of Jesus contrasts vividly with the spate of childish stories which were later current in the apocryphal gospels . The processes of thought by which Jesus arrived at His Messianic consciousness may claim the interest of some modern theologians , but were never considered important by the evangelists . <p> In the body of the gospels there are a few hints given of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was known as the carpenter or the carpenter 's son ( Mark 6:3 ; Matt 13:55 ) . Moreover , there were other children in the family " James , Joses , Simon , Judas and some sisters ( Matt 13:55 , 56 ) . None of the Nazareth inhabitants apparently expected Jesus to show much wisdom or to do mighty works , for they were astonished when His ministry was in progress . The mystery of the hidden years is deepened by the obvious hardness of the people who knew Him best . <h> The period of preparation <p> Before the actual commencement of the ministry of Jesus , there were several significant events " the preaching of John the Baptist , the baptism and temptation of Jesus . All three of these events are of basic importance for the records of the public ministry of Jesus in the synoptic gospels , although Mark makes only a passing reference to the Temptation . <p> The ministry of John the Baptist must be considered in the light of contemporary Judaism . There was certainly the expectation of the dawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was belief in the approach of the kingdom of God , although popular ideas were mostly materialistic , but John did not follow the normal pattern . In his methods and teaching he was like one of the ancient prophets . In many respects he was the last of an era . He was this only because he was able to point to the Inaugurator of another era and the dawn of a new kingdom . All three synoptic writers mention the testimony of Isaiah to the coming of John the Baptist . The link with the past is thus established and a divine authority is given to the work of the herald of Jesus . All the writers record the preparatory ministry of the Baptist , but it is Luke in particular who carries on the quotation from Isaiah to include the promise that all flesh should see God 's salvation . The records clearly bring out John the Baptist 's call to repent , and his prediction of the Coming One who would be greater than he , and would baptize with the Holy Spirit . Both Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the arrival of the One to come . <p> When John preached a baptism of repentance , there was immediate criticism of the Pharisees and Sadducees , who were described as a generation of vipers , a particularly strong expression of adverse opinion which was intended to bring them to a state of true repentance . There is a forthrightness and sternness about John 's message which showed the serious character of his preparatory work . With such a herald as he , whose clothing of camel 's hair drew attention to the sternness of his character , the coming of Jesus was set against a morally challenging situation . Men were being prepared by the serious call to repentance . Moreover , the challenge to moral reformation was made specific by the Baptist , as Luke brings out clearly by samples of the advice given to tax collectors and soldiers . <p> The rite of baptism was not new with John . The Jews practiced proselyte baptism , and some groups , e.g. , the Essenes , appear to have practiced ritual cleansing , which was closely akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance on the rite , and it is interesting to conjecture whether John had had personal contact with the community . If he had previously done this , he had certainly departed from their pattern , for they were essentially inward-looking and their rites were exclusively for initiates ; John was essentially outward-looking , directing his call for repentance to the multitudes . According to Matthew 's account , he announced the imminence of the kingdom of heaven in the same terms that Jesus began to preach . This is clearly intended to show the continuity between the preaching of both , although the fundamental difference between them is that Jesus is Himself the Inaugurator of the kingdom , whereas John was only the herald . <p> The baptism of Jesus is the climax of John 's work . When the king arrived , the herald 's work was done . John was expecting to announce Jesus , but he never expected that Jesus would present Himself for baptism . The one he was expecting was surely beyond the need for repentance . His greatness was such that John felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request a baptism of repentance ? Matthew alone records John 's hesitation and for this reason some scholars have regarded this as a later addition , prompted by motives of reverence , but in view of John 's overwhelming conviction that Jesus was infinitely greater than he , it would have been much more surprising if no hesitation had been recorded . At the same time the reason for Jesus ' action must be considered . According to Matthew , it was to fulfill all righteousness ( Matt 3:15 ) , by which Jesus made clear to John that it was the right and proper thing for Him to be baptized . <p> The problem arises concerning Jesus ' submission to a rite which was specifically described as a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins . None of the synoptic evangelists gives the explanation , but all record the attestation of the heavenly voice bearing witness to the beloved Son in whom the Father is well pleased . The identification of Jesus with those needing repentance was clearly part of the divine plan . For the multitudes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for Jesus it meant a call to identify Himself with a sinful people . Neither John nor any of the witnesses could recognize the theological implications of this symbolic act . It was part of the process that Paul later recognized , in which Christ was made sin for mankind ( 2 Cor 5:21 ) . <p> Undoubtedly all the evangelists see the baptism as the commencement of the public ministry of Jesus . This is marked esp . by the descent of the Spirit upon Him ( in the form of a dove ) and by the heavenly attestation . This differentiated Jesus from all others who attended John 's baptism . It is improbable that these supernatural signs were seen by any apart from John and Jesus , but for the evangelists their importance lay in their revelation of the nature of the mission of Jesus . John 's gospel is most specific of all in recording the remarkable pronouncement of John the Baptist that Jesus was the Lamb of God who takes away the world 's sin ( John 1:29 ) .

The fact that later doubts gripped the mind of the Baptist regarding the claims of Jesus does not vitiate his confident prediction at the commencement of the ministry . <p> This was perhaps the most revealing event in the preparatory period . The fact that it followed immediately from the baptism is regarded as significant by all the synoptic evangelists . As Jesus had identified Himself with sinners in John 's baptism , so He exposed Himself to the temptings of the devil . It would be better to speak of testings rather than temptations , since the latter word has too often become associated with a yielding approach which was certainly not present in the case of Jesus . Details of the characteristics of the testings which came to Him are given only by Matthew and Luke , although Mark mentions some important features , such as the presence of wild beasts and the ministration of angels . <p> In all the accounts the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic introduction to the later Passion narratives , in which the climax of the conflict is enacted .

They are , moreover , not to be restricted to the period of forty days , as Luke makes clear when he mentions that the devil 's withdrawal was until a convenient season . The course of the ministry frequently presented occasions in which the testings would be repeated . <p> To understand the temptations , account must be taken of the Messianic consciousness of Jesus . He was deeply aware of His mission and His power to accomplish it . The testings concerned the methods He would use to accomplish it . The use of miraculous power for His own preservation ( to turn stone to bread ) was rejected as totally unworthy of His mission . It would amount to a failure to maintain true priorities . Moreover , the urge to use the same miraculous powers to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien to His true purpose . It would appeal to the spectacular , but would be diametrically opposed to the divine methods . <p> The other recorded testing concerned the character of the kingdom which Jesus had come to inaugurate . Was it to be comparable to the kingdoms of this world ? Was it to share its glory with theirs ? Such a possibility was unthinkable , and would amount to conceding allegiance to the devil , in whose hands , as Jesus acknowledged , were the imperial ambitions of the present age . His kingdom was of a totally different order . <p> In all three of the temptations recorded , the Lord overcomes the tempting of the devil by means of the Scriptures , as the most appropriate medium for establishing the principles of divine action . <p> The difference in order of the temptations in Matthew and Luke are more significant for the respective purpose of each than for the consciousness of Jesus Himself .

Whether either knew the precise order or whether either attached any special importance to it is impossible to say . <p> The record of these temptations is generally appealed to as evidence that Jesus was in all respects tempted as men are ( cf. Heb 4:15 ) , but this is true in only a limited respect . Since Jesus alone possessed Messianic consciousness and power , the testings which came to Him were unique . But it can not be denied that they are allied to those which afflict all men . It must be recognized that Jesus was exposed to many more temptations than those recorded , which must be regarded as typical . <p> The public ministry of Jesus opened against a background of tremendous struggle and a resolute rejection of all methods of achieving His mission which were opposed to the real purpose for which He came .

And because they are inspired , no other books are ; they have a unique divine authority by which we follow in our life and belief what they teach . <p> How did the church come to the decision about these 66 books being the normative standard for faith and practice ? <p> 1 . Written by a recognized prophet or apostle <p> This did not cover every book of the Bible ; in fact there are some books for which we simply do not know who the author is . Hebrews is one book that took a long time for the church to recognize ; now , do n't have in mind that the church just decrees that now this is authoritative . But it did take longer on some books than others for the church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took longer because who is the author ? By a number of other criteria ( which we will come to ) , it is clear that Hebrews is inspired ; it belongs in the canon , but authorship caused it to be accepted late . But many of the books of the Bible are able to be accepted by the fact that they are written by a recognized prophet , by Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , Moses , Paul or Peter . So there are a lot of books that are pretty clear cut because of the author . <p> 2 . Written by those associated with recognized prophet or apostle <p> These are books written by those associated with a recognized prophet or apostle who obviously learned from the apostle or prophet , and therefore the book is recognized really as under his supervision or teaching or instruction . The clearest case of this would be Luke and Acts . They comprise a lot of the New Testament in terms of total pages . That is a big volume of our New Testament that is not written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Paul . As he explains in Luke 1 , he worked very hard to represent accurately from sources which he gathered what was true about Christ , his life , ministry , teaching , death and resurrection . So close proximately to an apostle or prophet was an important aspect . <p> 3 . Truthfulness ( Deut. 18:20-22 ) <p> Truthfulness of the writing . If anything were found in a writing that was not true , it would be dismissed as not from God . God himself said in Deuteronomy 18:20-22 that if a prophet claims to be speaking from me , and what he said is not true , then he has not spoken from me . It is not from the Lord if that is the case . You can see why inerrantists are so insistent on the accuracy of the Bible . God himself goes on record . If it is from God , it has to be accurate . <p> 4 .

You will recall when Jesus met the two on the road to Emmaus and was talking with them . That is clearly a reference to the Old Testament that was used and accepted in the days of Jesus . <p> Now the New Testament becomes , as we have alluded to , a more difficult matter in some books . 2 Peter 3:16 is interesting . There is obviously an awareness in the first century , an apostolic awareness , that more Scripture was being written . Paul himself understands what he wrote was the Word of God .

Church Usage and Recognition <p> Ultimately , what happened was that these letters circulated and more and more groups of Christian people were edified by these writings and came to witness together that these writings were from God . The Church used these writings and was deeply edified by them ; they were believed over time that they were from God , and so the final acceptance of the recognition of the 66 books of the Bible as Scripture took place at the Senate of Carthage in A. D. 397 . That is not to say that prior to that there was not wide recognition of most of the Bible ( we are talking here mostly about the New Testament ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominical approval in Luke 24 when Christ says the Law , the Prophets and the Writings ) .

@@35723561 @4723561/ <h> Chapter VI : The Attributes of God <p> God reveals Himself not only in His names , but also in His attributes , that is , in the perfections of the divine Being . It is customary to distinguish between incommunicable and communicable attributes . Of the former there are no traces in the creature ; of the latter there are . <h> 1 . The Incommunicable Attributes <p> These emphasize the absolute distinction between God and the creature , and include the following : <p> a . The independence or self-existence of God . This means that God has the ground of His existence in Himself , and unlike man , does not depend on anything outside of Himself . He is independent in His Being , in His virtues and actions , and causes all His creatures to depend on Him . The idea is embodied in the name Jehovah and finds expression in the following passages , Ps. 33:11 ; 115:3 ; Isa. 40:18 ff. ; Dan . 4:35 ; John 5:26 ; Rom. 11:33-36 ; Acts 17:25 ; Rev. 4:11 . <p> b . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchangeable . He is forever the same in His divine Being and perfections , and also in His purposes and promises , Num. 23:19 ; Psa . 33:11 ; 102:27 ; Mal. 3:6 ; Heb. 6:17 ; Jas. 1:17 . This does not mean , however , that there is no movement in God . The Bible speaks of Him as coming and going , hiding and revealing Himself . He is also said to repent , but this is evidently only a human way of speaking of God , Ex. 32:14 ; Jonah 3:10 , and really indicates a change in man 's relation to God . <p> c . The infinity of God . This means that God is not subject . to limitations . We can speak of His infinity in more than one sense . Viewed in relation to His being , it may be called His absolute perfection . He is unlimited in His knowledge and wisdom , in His goodness and love , in His righteousness and holiness , Job 11:7-10 ; Psa . 145:3 . Seen in relation to time , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture as endless duration , Ps. 90:2 ; 102:12 , it really means that He is above time and therefore not subject to its limitations . For Him there is only an eternal present , and no past or future . Viewed with reference to space , it is called His immensity . He is everywhere present , dwells in all His creatures , filling every point of space , but is in no way bounded by space , I Kings 8:27 ; Ps. 139:7-10 ; Isa. 66 ; 1 ; Jer. 23:23 , 24 ; Acts 17:27 , 28 . <p> d . The simplicity of God . By ascribing simplicity to God we mean that He is not composed of various parts , such as the body and soul in man , and for that very reason is not subject to division . The three persons in the Godhead are not so many parts of which the divine essence is composed . The whole being of God belongs to each one of the Persons . Hence we can also say that God and His attributes are one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness , truth , and so on . <h> 2 . The Communicable Attributes <p> These are the attributes of which we find some resemblance in man . It should be borne in mind , however , that what we see in man is only a finite ( limited ) and imperfect likeness of that which is infinite ( unlimited ) and perfect in God . Here we have : <p> a . The knowledge of God . This is that perfection of God whereby He , in a manner all His own , knows Himself and all things possible and actual . God has this knowledge in Himself , and does not obtain it from without . It is always complete and always present in His mind . And because it is all-comprehensive , it is called omniscience . He knows all things , past , present and future , and not only the things that have real existence , but also those which are merely possible . I Kings 8:29 ; Ps. 139:1-16 ; Isa. 46:10 ; Ezek. 11:5 ; Acts 15:18 ; John 21:17 ; Heb. 4:13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wisdom is an aspect of His knowledge . It is the virtue of God which manifest itself in the selection of worthy ends and in the choice of the best means for the realization of those ends . The final end to which He makes all things subservient is His own glory . Rom. 11:33 ; I Cor. 2:7 ; Eph. 1:6 , 12 , 14 ; Col. 1:16 . <p> c . The goodness of God . God is good , that is , perfectly holy . in Himself . But this is not the goodness we have in mind here . In this connection we refer to the divine goodness that reveals itself in doing well unto others . It is that perfection which prompts Him to deal kindly and bounteously with all His creatures The Bible refers to it repeatedly , Ps. 36:6 ; 104:21 ; 145:8 , 9 , 16 ; Matt. 5:45 ; Acts 14:17 . <p> d . The love of God . This is often called the most central attribute of God , but it is doubtful whether it should be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In virtue of it He delights in His own perfections and in man as the reflection of His image . It may be considered from various points of view . The unmerited love of God which reveals itself in pardoning sin is called His grace , Eph. 1:6 , 7 ; 2:7-9 ; Tit. 2:11 . That love relieving the misery of those who are bearing the consequences of sin is known as His mercy or tender compassion , Luke 1:64 , 72 , 78 ; Rom. 15:9 ; 9:16 , 18 ; Eph. 2:4 . And when it bears with the sinner who does not heed the instructions and warnings of God it is named His longsuffering or forbearance , Rom. 2:4 ; 9:22 ; I Pet . 3:20 ; II Pet . 3:16 . <p> e . The holiness of God . God 's holiness is first of all that divine perfection by which He is absolutely distinct from all His creatures , and exalted above them in infinite majesty . Ex. 15:11 ; Isa. 57:15 . But it denotes in the second place that He is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally perfect . In the presence of the holy God man is deeply conscious of his sin , Job 34:10 ; Isa. 6:5 ; Hab. 1:13 . <p> f . The righteousness of God . The righteousness of God is that perfection by which He maintains Himself as the Holy One over against every violation of His holiness . In virtue of it He maintains a moral government in the world and imposes a just law on man , rewarding obedience and punishing disobedience , Ps. 99:4 ; Isa. 33:22 ; Rom , 1:32 . The justice of God which manifests itself in the giving of rewards is called His remunerative justice ; and that which reveals itself in meting out punishment is known as His retributive justice . The former is really an expression of His love , and the latter of His wrath . <p> g . The veracity of God . This is that perfection of God in virtue of which He is true in His inner being , in His revelation , and in His relation to His people . He is the true God over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is faithful in the fulfillment of His promises . From the last point of view this attribute is also called God 's faithfulness . Num. 23:19 ; I Cor. 1:9 ; II Tim . 2:13 ; Heb. 10:23 . <p> h . The sovereignty of God . This may be considered from two different points of view , namely , His sovereign will , and His sovereign power . The will of God is represented in Scripture as the final cause of all things , Eph. 4:11 ; Rev. 4:11 . On the basis of Deut. 29:29 it is customary to distinguish between the secret and the revealed will of God . The former is the will of God 's decree , which is hidden in God and can be known only from its effects , and the latter is the will of His precept , which is revealed in the law and in the gospel . God 's will respecting His creatures is absolutely free , Job 11:10 ; 33:13 ; Ps. 115:3 ; Prov. 21:1 ; Matt. 20:15 ; Rom. 9:15-18 ; Rev. 4:11 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sovereign will , Gen. 50:20 ; Acts 2:23 . The power to execute His will is called his omnipotence . That God is omnipotent does not mean that He can do everything . The Bible teaches us that there are some things which God can not do . He can not lie , sin , deny Himself , Num. 23:19 ; I Sam . 15:29 ; II Tim . 2:13 ; Heb. 6:18 ; Jas. 1:13 , 17 . It does mean that He can , by the mere exercise of Hie will , bring to pass whatsoever He has decided to accomplish , and that , if He so desired , He could do even more than that , Gen. 18:14 ; Jer. 32:27 ; Zech. 8:6 ; Matt. 3:9 ; 26:53 . <h> To memorize .

The Israelites were forty years in the wilderness , it turns out they were thirty-eight years and eleven months but you round it off to forty and forty means several dozen . The flood was caused for Noah by rain that came forty days and forty nights . That is an idiomatic expression that could be translated , " several dozen days and nights steadily . " Jesus was tempted in the wilderness for forty days . It might have been thirty-six , it could have been fifty-one , it means several dozen . Because of this , one has to be a little careful about the New Testament reference to the Old Testament . Even though the New Testament is in Greek , the people writing the New Testament are all baptized Jews and they are all reflective of Semitic idiomatic language even in their Greek . We see lots of examples of that ; it is not hard to prove it . That just gives us caution about accepting as purely literal the term " forty " in the New Testament . We do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saul , probably not more than forty and that is the best we know how to do . <h> II . 1 &amp; 2 Samuel <p> One of the wonderful things to be aware of when we start reading the stories is that 1 and 2 Samuel are really a unit . They get their name from Samuel , an early key character . He is the big early character in the book obviously . This is very normal . This is what is called incipit naming . Incipit is a Latin word , which means " the beginning of " something or " as it begins , " beginning naming . We do this for many , many hymns and poems . What is the name of the hymn ? " Blessed Assurance . " How does it start ? Blessed assurance . What is the name of the hymn ? Amazing Grace . How does it start ? Amazing grace . It is incipit naming ; it is a very common thing to do . Some hymnals name all tunes by the incipit . Every tune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " love lifted me " , they will title the hymn , " I Was Sinking Deep In Sin . " The Bible does a lot of incipit titling . An awful lot of the traditional titles come from the first couple of words or some key phrase early on or some character who is prominent early on . It turns out that Samuel dies still in what we call 1 Samuel . In a way to call a book 2 Samuel is funny . He is not in there , he is dead . Yet what really is being reflected here is that the two books were joined and were one book . It is in the Septuagint tradition , the Greek Old Testament , that we get the beginnings of the divisions . It is an awfully long book ; it is easier to divide it . <p> A. Really what it is , is a bifid . I have used this term before , I will use it again . A bifid book , the Book of Samuel , does divide rather neatly down the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , in what we call 1 Samuel , half way through the whole thing roughly , you have the reign of Saul and the life of Samuel and in the second half , as it were , you have the reign of David . <p> B. We are also going to go into 1 Kings 1-11 tonight to talk about Solomon . Notice the situation . Solomon who was in some ways Israel 's most prestigious king , richest , most famous around the ancient world , perhaps most influential , at least in some key ways , he gets eleven chapters though his reign is forty years . Whereas Saul and David who certainly do not reign any longer than Solomon and who were much more local and less , kind of , cosmopolitan and international get much more coverage . In the same way we talked about the way the book of Judges is organized with a desire to get a message across and not as strong a desire to try to tell every thing " even Steven " chronologically . " If three years went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text . Three more years , that same amount of space . " No . You want to make points , you want to get themes across , you want to teach people about God 's relationship to his people and that is going to adjust your space needs and the ratios of space-to-time events in a different way than if you just told everything evenly according to chronological spacing . Same thing in Joshua as we saw it . I think it is obvious in Genesis that we saw that and we have it here again in the books of Samuel and the lives of the three great kings up until 1 Kings 11 . We are going to see that likewise in the rest of the historical books , 1 and 2 Kings and in Chronicles and so on . It is very important , therefore , when you are thinking about planning out a preaching series not to say , " Well , I 'm just going to cover everything evenly . " You have to ask instead the question , " What is emphasized here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ? " If a heavy amount of the main principial material is loaded in the first quarter of the book should I preach more sermons from the first quarter of the book where the juicy stuff is than I do from any other quarter ? The answer might be of course , that is exactly what you should do . When you are doing a Bible study , the usual thing is , " We 're going to do chapter 14 next week because we did Chapter 13 tonight . Right ? " The usual way . If you are wise about it you might just say , " Guys , I have organized this Bible study a little bit differently . Bear with me ; I think you 'll like it . We are going to do sometimes three or four chapters in one week and other times we are going to do a few verses in one night . The reason we are doing this is because there are some things that we 'll see that way that we might otherwise miss . " If people try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits accordingly . It is always useful to appreciate that the structure of these things and the things emphasized can sometimes be not in normal , typical proportion to the actual passage of time . They are not just what we call annals or straight , chronologically-based history . It is not just reports typed up . No , this is stuff where what happened is selected from and written up in a way that is constantly teaching you about what God wants , what his values are , how he is at work , and how we should be reflective of his purposes and interests . It is another kind of literature from straight history and we have to use it that way . <h> III . Three Levels of Narrative <p> I would like also to say something else while I am talking about introductory matters . This is something that we talk about in the book , How To Read the Bible For All Its Worth , but I just want to be sure you hear it . There really are three levels of narrative operating all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what narrative is . <p> A. First , there is the top level of narrative and that is the level that really is the Bible 's story as a whole . The great grand story of redemption . Here we are living in a planet where we are in sin and we need a rescue , we need a savior to come and help us , can not do it ourselves and the Old Testament leads up to that and primes you for it and teaches you how it is a necessity . The New Testament shows it happening and points toward eternal life and so on . That is the big picture , the Bible story , the great top level . <p> B. But then there is going to be a middle level and that is going to be the individual , large blocks of material . For example , we might say the stories of Saul . These occupy most of 1 Samuel . All about how there was a need for him to become king and how he was chosen and the various up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the term " cycle " for that . I am not sure why because it does not seem to me all that descriptive . But they will talk about the " Saul Cycle " and I think the idea probably is that you draw a circle around it and say in this circle is all the stuff about Saul--the Saul Cycle . I would just say the stories , the block that is about Saul . <p> C. But then there is going to be the lowest level or the lower level . That is going to be any particular , individual story about him . How , for example , he hid among the baggage one time when he should have been out there leading the people . Individual story , might be ten verses long or a chapter long or whatever . But that is the individual story . Maybe the story of how David could have killed him when he was in the cave but David did not and so what that demonstrated about Saul . Individual story , sometimes just a few verses , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate the fact that that is the way it works all the time in narrative . You have always got three levels going at once . The richness of what God has inspired normally comes out better to you and to others if you will just say , " Alright , our Bible study , I 'm ready to talk about the low level , that is this particular story of how Saul would get furious and how David calmed him down with music . I am ready to do that . " But am I ready to say how does this fit within the overall block about Saul . What part of the story about Saul does this fill in ? What if it were not there ? What would we not know about Saul that we ought to know about Saul ? That is the preparation in the middle level . But then for really effective Bible study I suggest you want also to say , " How does this relate to the big picture ? Why is this thing in the Bible as a whole ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God included this story ? What is the purpose ? What is its special role , its particular contribution , its support to the real big plan of redemption ? " That is very useful to ask . You do not want to overbuild the story and say , " This story about Saul and the cave is key to the atonement . " You do not want to do that , you are overdoing it , so you have to put it in its proper place . It may be that you will say that this is a very small thing but you always ought to see how it somehow touches on the top level . This is part of really properly addressing a Biblical story . By the way , the term is often used pericope this term for an individual level of a narrative . A pericope means something you can cut around , it is a small unit but it is self-contained . You can say , " Yeah , here is a little story , a little incident . " It is a story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually cut it out of the page and you can still read it and say , " Okay , that is a story that has a beginning , a middle , and an end . " We call that a pericope . Another term that is used is passage . Passage is a looser term than pericope . Pericope specifically means a true , self-contained unit . Whatever is a particular , smallest , self-contained unit that you have got . You want to identify all three levels . Definitely in preaching you want to do that . If you are preaching through 1 Samuel , you are preaching through the middle level but you are preaching each week on one of the lowest level pericopes and hopefully you are always relating it every week to the big picture so that people come away saying , " I 'm glad that I heard that sermon because that explained to me from that passage about things that relate to the big picture of why I 'm a Christian and why I am trying to follow Christ and what my purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and for this world of his . " It is great to do that . We talk about it and give some illustrations of it from the book of Genesis , and so on , in the chapter on reading narratives in How To Read the Bible For All Its Worth . But I think that this is a good kind of thing to be aware of . Sometimes this top level gets call the " Meta-Narrative . " From the Greek meta that can mean , kind of , overarching , it is one of its possible meanings , or accompanying everything . The meta-narrative is the top level ; just another terminology that is sometimes used . <h> IV . The Kingdom of Saul <p> Let 's take a look at a map and just get a feel for something that I think is helpful to observe . This map is titled The Kingdom of Saul and I know you can not see all of the individual locations and so on , but can you see that within the promised land there is this red line delineating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a couple of circles within the outer red line ? Those circles represent key territory that even during the kingdom of Saul was absolutely not in Israelite hands . If you had enough time and a very fine pen you could draw a lot of other circles too , because , in fact , lots and lots of Canaanites were living everywhere among the people . Broadly speaking , Saul was the dominant political leader of the whole area and the Israelites were more dominant than the Canaanites except in these two areas . One of them is around Jerusalem , the other is up in the country around Beth-shan and you see that right around that area is also the designation Mount Gilboa . Mount Gilboa is the place where Saul loses his life at the end of the book of 1 Samuel . That final chapter when he is killed and Jonathan the crowned prince is killed , they are battling it out at Mount Gilboa . What this means is that as I have drawn the arrow , the Philistines which already have a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelites all the way in to other non-Israelite territory . Saul is fighting to keep the country from being totally divided . That is how desperate things were and how powerful the enemies could be at various times . Did Saul generally keep this under general on-balance Israelite control ? Sure , but it was not easy . During the reign of Saul the conquest still remains incomplete . We saw the issues related to Joshua , the problems of sin , the example of it in chapter 7 , the sin of Achan . We saw in Judges the references to the fact that the land was not entirely in the hands of the Israelites and sadly the Israelites were not very worthy occupants of the land in their behavior so their enemies often oppressed them . Now we see during the days of Saul it is continuing . It is still problematic and difficult . <h> V. Orienting Data for 1&amp;2 Samuel <p> Let me then give a little bit of orienting data for 1 and 2 Samuel . <p> A. Here is a summary of the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very carefully chosen word , from the last judge , Samuel , to the first king , Saul . That is important . This is the book , 1 Samuel , in which we move from the era of the judges , which was a very long period of time , somewhere between 250 and 400 years , a really long time , and the kingship , which is of course inaugurated by Saul . So Samuel is the last of something . He is the last of the judges . He does function like a judge . He is sometimes a military leader . He is sometimes a spiritual leader . He is even more specially very often functioning virtually as a priest but by all means he was also judging , that is , like any prominent national leader in Bible times he became kind of an appeals court . The king did this , the leader of any country ; the leader of any tribe would become an appeals court . It happened to Moses , it continued to happen to leaders . Of course they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . <p> 2 . But also I have said here the rise and tumultuous reign of David . We tend to think of David in very , very favorable terms because of his role in the history of salvation , the plan of redemption . David plays a key role in the plan of redemption but he plays it very imperfectly . He is in many ways a real scoundrel and in many ways a weakling at what he does . What David is so good at is military leadership . He is just a fabulously good , extremely skillful military leader . In most other ways he is not good . The picture of David , which is described mostly in 2 Samuel ( 2 Samuel is basically the story of David 's reign as king ) , one observes David having numbers of rebellions against him including from his own family , being a pretty poor husband and father and having all kinds of strife and hardship as a result in his family . We also see him not well able to handle some kinds of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even late in his life we see him in the beginning chapters of 1 Kings saying to Solomon , " You know , I always wanted to get rid of Joab but I could n't . Why do n't you do it ? " The weak kind of leader who says I need somebody else to fire this person , I can not bring myself to do it directly . The great thing about David is that he is God 's choice and if God makes him his choice God is going to do through him what he wants to do . So God appoints him to be the king who will be the beginning of the dynasty in Jerusalem that will not end but will in fact come to fabulous fruition in the King of kings , that is , Jesus . So God just designates him . It is not that he says , " David , as I 've examined you , I have found you like Noah , just righteous in my eyes . " No that is not said , he is a rascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . He is going to use this guy and he is going to give him a prominent position in history and accordingly there will be much made of David in the Scripture . But , since we have so much detail about him we know that he is hardly a moral example . <p> B. We also do not know who the author is here ; we have the problem of not knowing who wrote most of the Old Testament narrative books . These people are not named . We can call somebody the Chronicler or we can call somebody the author of whatever but we really do not know . However , I think it is reasonably said often that these books are called the former prophets . That is a longstanding traditional designation in Judaism and it is because of two things . 1 ) These books reflect just as the prophets do God 's story based on his covenant with his people . There is a lot of good advice , good knowledge in these stories . 2 ) Whenever there is any hint given of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few places where it will say , " Are not the rest of these things found in the chronicles of the prophet Iddo , or is not this found in such and such . " Because whenever you have a sense of who the author might be of some little section that was largely borrowed or whatever then you find out that it is a prophet . There is a lot behind the idea of calling these books the Former Prophets . In Judaism you have four blocks of material . You have the books of Moses or the Pentateuch ; the Former Prophets , what we call from Joshua to 2 Kings ; then you have the Prophets , the sixteen prophetical books ; then the rest are lumped together called the Writings . That is a simple , easy , catch-all type of coverage for designating the books . We are right in the heart of the former prophets with what we deal with tonight . <p> C. When would they have been written ? It just seems like Solomon , a commissioner of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one to have these all written down , gather the materials together , have them composed . Thus , since you are covering David 's reign and then Solomon 's reign with 1 and 2 Samuel and the beginning of Kings , it is just likely that 1 and 2 Samuel are written down during Solomon 's time and that Solomon 's story would have been written down shortly after he died in around 931 B.C. <p> D. It is from the last judge , Samuel , maybe 1090 B.C. , to the last years of David 's kingship , that is 971 . David apparently reigned 1011 to 971 B.C. That is the best dates that anybody has been able to come up with . <p> E. What are some of the emphases ? We have talked about he overview , what are some of the emphases ? Here are fourteen of them . <p> 1 . Any historical narrative is going to include the continuation of God 's plan of redemption . That is important to appreciate . You look for that in one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan ; a promise that starts in the book of Genesis , God is carrying it through . There may be lots of ups and downs but you are following the progress . God will not let his people just fall off into nothing and be decayed . He will not let this world fail to hear his good news so he has got a way of working the plan in , it is leading somewhere , it is always going somewhere . <p> 2 . The need for transition , that is a terribly important theme . <p> 3 . Samuel 's good service . He is a fine figure and has a few flaws but not many . He is a real welcome breath of fresh air after the book of Judges ends its story of the judges with someone like Samson . Boy , is Samuel a nice contrast by comparison . <p> 4 . Danger from the Philistines . There are many enemies that bother the Israelites , the Amalekites now and again , the Moabites now and again , various groups , but always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judges so it is in 1 and 2 Samuel . The powerful enemy , the one they really have to fear , the one that is the massive threat , that is the Philistines--constant , steady threat . The Philistines are stuck on the coast and they want inland . If I just show the map again for a moment , you see everything along the west is Philistine territory . But it is a coastal plain and you can only do so much in a coastal plain . There is a lot of sand there ; there is a certain amount of grain that can be raised but very difficult to raise cattle there , very difficult to raise sheep and goats . Almost impossible to grow figs and wine , it just will not grow there as well . The Philistines want to move inland . That is what they want . They want the same territory that the Israelites have got . The Philistines are well organized , they are skillful , their culture is far superior to that of the Israelites , unfortunately for the Israelites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judges to the fact that when people wanted to get a sword or spear sharpened , or for that matter , an ax handle or anything else , they really had to go to the Philistines because the Israelites were in effect still living in the Bronze Age and the Philistines were technologically much advanced . This is so archeologically . You look at Philistine pottery , some of it is fabulous , beautiful stuff , well made , beautifully shaped , beautifully decorated . You look at Israelite pottery and it looks like something a kid made in kindergarten . You look at Philistine homes , beautiful paved-floor homes , very nice . Look at Israelite homes , all dirt floor and not very big and not very fancy . Did God pick the Israelites because they were good , the kind of people who could have gotten a PhD if it had been offered ? No , he did not pick them because they had anything going for them . They were a bunch of former slaves in Egypt . That is all they were . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige , the education , the anything but he chose them to be his people . It is a wonderful story . That is what he does with people all the time today . You can not impress God ; he is not impressed by that sort of thing . He chooses whom he will and when he chooses it is wonderful thing to be part of that people that he has set up for himself . The fact that you can ask to get in is really wonderful . <p> 5 . Saul 's tragic reign . Sadly his story is a tragedy , that is , it ends unhappily rather than happily . It starts out with great promise and goes down hill . <p> 6 . The hopeful rise of David . This is a big theme , the rise of David . Because almost all through 1 Samuel the action is with David . David is mentioned more in 1 Samuel than he is in 2 Samuel , which is about his reign . So the name David actually appears more during the time that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had as king . Then Saul is still king and David is trying to serve him and work with him and do this and that and half of the time running from him . All these different things that are happening and he is still technically rising . It is obvious that David is on his way to be king . We just keep following the story of the " Rise of David " . A couple of scholars have even used the abbreviation HDR ( History of David 's Rise ) to describe the preponderance of texts in 1 Samuel that are obviously on that topic . <p> 7 . God 's protection of His people is a great theme ; you ought to always preach and teach that . <p> 8 . The need for not just any king but a good king . That is terribly important . What the Israelites thought is , " We need a king " . What Samuel reminded them , what Deuteronomy 17 had already predicted to them , what many of them understood but many did not was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good king . That is the key . A lot is to be made of that , I think , in your preaching and teaching . <p> 9 . The messianic " Davidic Covenant " . A very important theme that we will look at , I hope . <p> 10 . Completion of the conquest . David is the one . David really does subdue the whole Promised Land very decisively . <p> 11 . The choice of Jerusalem . Jerusalem eventually becomes the biblical city--the place where we all belong , the metaphor in Scripture for heaven itself . <p> 12 . The horrible consequences of David 's adultery , and they are severe . The prophet comes to him and says , " The sword will not depart from your family . " A way of saying , " From now on , family warfare . " <p> 13 . Various rebellions against David showing that he was a weak leader in many ways from the point of view of popularity . If it were not for very great personal loyalty to him on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain his position as king until his death . <p> 14 . Initial plans for a temple . They come out of a disastrous plague in the last chapter as you have read it , 2 Samuel 24 . The temple is a very important thing and the transition , therefore , from tabernacle to temple is also technically going on in these books . It is a transition from judgeship to kingship and a transition from non-monarchy to monarchy and transition from tribal to federal . But it is also , interestingly enough , a transition from tabernacle to temple . That is partly built into this because certainly when you finish with the story of Solomon you have got the temple all full built and no more tabernacle . <h> VI . Overview <p> Finally take a look at this little overview . It just may help put a couple of things in perspective for you . <p> A. If you look at the first seven chapters Samuel is it . He is the focus of those chapters . Yes , Eli is in there and Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel . <p> B. Then , from 1 Samuel 8 to 1 Samuel 15 you have Samuel and Saul working together . So the stories tend to be about them both , interaction between the two of them . <p> C. Then when you hit 1 Samuel 16 and onward suddenly David is in the picture and Samuel is not . Samuel has almost no role to play . Mention is made of his death very briefly but he has just suddenly receded and the inspired author is now working with the pair , David and Saul . <p> D. Then after the breakpoint , after the middle of the bifid point , after the division of the book , you have in 2 Samuel David alone . The transition thing that I have talked about is kind of even emphasized . Here is one person then somebody joins in and then that person fades and somebody comes in and joins him--it is almost like the way we think of a relay race . One person for a while they are together then one person takes over for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the last judge to the greatest of the kings , David . I say Solomon is in many ways thought of as greater but the Bible presents David as the greatest in a very interesting pattern where what could have been said other ways was not but rather this is very thematically organized to be sure you see that as God was working he was working through this person , the next one came in and then the next one comes in and there is a replacement going on but it is very orderly , very steady during this " United Monarchy . " It will not be steady necessarily and it will not be orderly necessarily during the divided monarchy . In the north it will be chaotic at many , many points . Likewise in the south , though the south will preserve always the David dynasty . Every king of the south will be descended from David . None of the kings of the north will be . So one dynasty for the whole history of the south , many for the north . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@35723563 @4723563/ <h> Protestant Church in England in the Late 17th Century <p> We have come to the point where what we think of as modern denominations are beginning to take shape , and that is what I want to talk about today . <p> Just to remind you of what we 've been saying , if you look at the period from say 1559 to 1640 , you have a gradually emergence of Puritanism with various strands within it , the more extreme form of Separatism coming out of this in the 1590 's . About the only outlet for these people if they were not prepared to conform to the official church in England , was to leave the country . Increasingly , that is what they did . The substance of the New England colonies was founded ; the bulk of their population came into being because of this . People who felt that for one reason or another , they were not free to worship in the way that they wished in their home country , so they left in order to get what they thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom is not what you and I think of as religious freedom . They thought that they knew the right way of doing things and when they got the opportunity they were going to push it down the throats of everybody else . This was an aspect of Puritanism that you need to remember . It was not tolerant of people who disagreed with them . <p> This was one of the major problems , because in the next phase , from 1640 to 1660 , which is the time of revolution , the Puritans took over the government in Britain as a whole , but as I pointed out last time , this did n't work because of internal divisions among themselves . Puritans were people who knew what they did n't like , what they were against , but it was an awful lot more difficult for them to agree as to what they were for . Which way to go ahead , as opposed to what they were against . In particular , there was a major split between the Presbyterians , backed primarily by the Scotts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that England never became " the Presbyterians on the one hand and the Independents on the other . Independent is a term which embraces a wide range of people , including Baptists . They believed that each congregation should determine their own way of doing things . <p> Now , as I pointed out before , Oliver Cromwell , who had the army was an Independent , or at least he was in favor of the Independent position , although the Westminster Assembly and the parliament as a result , had approved the Presbyterian one . So , Presbyterianism was legal , it was the official religion , but in actual practice it could never impose itself because Cromwell and the Army were determined to allow Independents their own freedom . In fact there was quite a lot of toleration , although on paper there was n't . But it was something which was , from the long term point of view , unstable . In the circumstances of the mid 17th century , it was not going to last . Indeed , the Cromwellian regime eventually collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way it should be run . In the end , it was held together only by Cromwell 's own personality and the fact that he had won the war and that kind of thing . But when he died everything unraveled and fell apart . <p> One of the odd things about this whole period , one of the things that nobody expected was that the church of England , the Anglican Church , the Episcopal Church survived . No one had imagined that this would be possible , because the vast majority of people seemed to think that this had been set up by the state , by Queen Elizabeth in the first place , but basically it was a government organization , and that when it collapsed it would fall apart . Much to their surprise , there were people who supported it ; there were people who wanted the kind of prayer book liturgy they had got used to . It became clear for the first time that Episcopalianism was not just a government policy . There were people who genuinely believed and genuinely supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the Episcopal Church was suppressed , it was made illegal , it did not disappear or die out . As the 1650 's wore on , it seemed in some cases even to gain in strength at popular level , because the Episcopal Church was in a sense the default church , that if you were fed up with Puritanism and did n't really know where to turn , you figured things were better the way they were before , so let 's go back to that kind of thing and in some cases it did n't have a great deal to do with belief , it was more peace and quiet , that kind of thing . So , there was a lot of residual conservatism which played in favor of what had been the church establishment before 1640 . There was also genuine conviction . <p> Now , when Cromwell died in 1658 , the crisis of the regime began . The first question was what will we do ? Who is going to take over ? And the only person they could think of was Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two points of view . First of all , if you abolish a monarchy and kill the king , you do n't normally have a system in which son succeeds father into the highest government office . So that was a bad move , because it looked like a kind of monarchy without the king . This was a betrayal of the whole principle of a Puritan democratic regime . The other thing was that Oliver Cromwell was a great man . Richard Cromwell , his son was not . In a monarchy where you have generations of people sort of succeeding their parents or grandparents , you very seldom get anyone who is truly outstanding . If you look at the history of the British monarchy , how many of them would you say were outstanding anything . To be a successful king , being intelligent , active , brilliant and everything else has been a disadvantage . That is not what is expected of you . You are expected to be ordinary , harmless , friendly to everybody , and dignified . Richard Cromwell was actually that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place . But that was not what was expected at the time . He was expected to be a strong leader in a position which had been created for a strong leader . That he was not . Unlike others of his type , however , he realized as much and resigned . <p> This left the Army in control . The Army was in the control of somebody called General Monck . General Monck was a Presbyterian . The army was mainly Independent . He was responsible , fearing that the Presbyterian cause was loosing out " he was in charge of the army , but if someone else got to be in charge of the army . Presbyterianism was probably doomed in the state and trying to preserve this or at least a sense of a united church he hit on the idea of inviting the king back - that is to say Charles II , the son of Charles I who was in exile at this time . Charles II would do anything to get his throne back . And he promised in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be kind to everybody , be tolerant and that nobody had anything to fear from him . On that basis , parliament , the army and everybody else agreed to invite him back . In 1660 , he returned to London , much to the rejoicing of everybody because at long last it seemed that stability had returned to the country . <p> Now , Charles himself , if he had been able to fulfill the promises that he had made , probably would have introduced some kind of tolerant regime . He was not a believer . He 's is chiefly known to day for having fathered at least 14 illegitimate children , those were the ones he recognized , by a series of well known mistresses with whom he used to parade around in public . All kinds of people in England today claim to be descended from him . He has no legitimate descendents . Princess Diana , she was descended from Charles II , I believe three times over by different illegitimate children . Her son William , when he finally becomes king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended from Charles II . So , he himself was tolerant on the whole . It did n't matter to him what kind of church government you wanted or whether you were prepared to baptize infants or not . This was totally irrelevant to his concerns . <p> However , unfortunately , he was not a free agent . The people who had gone into exile with him were few but they were influential and they wanted their reward . The Episcopalians felt that their time had come . They had suffered indignity for 20 years and now it was time for revenge . They were determined that they were not going to allow a tolerant regime of the kind that the king had in mind . Initially there were kind of discussions with the Puritans and so on . The Episcopalian party torpedoed these . They refused to compromise . They put pressure on the king . They said after all , we are your best supporters . When the time came in 1662 , the parliament passed an act which is called the Act of Uniformity , imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying that the ministers who can not sign , who can not subscribe to this must resign . So , on the 24th of August in 1662 , when the new prayer book was introduced , the one which is still the official prayer book of the Church of England today , about 2000 ministers left , which is about 20% of the total of 10,000 in all . This included people like Richard Baxter and others who were quite prominent who had been , John Bunyan , and people like that . They all had to resign at this particular point . <p> Now , initially , this created a much bigger problem than anybody had for foreseen . It 's true that when the government realized that such a large number were leaving , they did try to bend over backwards at the last minute to prevent too many from going . But it was a bit late at that point for compromise . The result was that there were a series of laws passed basically excluding these dissenters as they are now called . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually have left the church . The earlier Puritans remained inside the church ; they just did n't conform to what the church demanded . But now , the ones who resigned , they actually left . Today when people talk about dissenters , non-conformist , Free Church , it 's all the same thing , but in historical terms it is not . <p> This is where we move into a new phase , because now , for the first time people who do n't agree with the official establishment are forced to organize themselves into congregations outside the law . They were illegal . These groups were known as Conventicles . Laws were passed against them . For example , it was decreed that no dissenting minister or congregation could live or meet within 5 miles of a town . They had to go off in the country in the middle of nowhere . It was also decreed that none of these people could stand for office of any kind . They could n't serve on town councils or anything like that . They were not allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matriculate unless they belong to the established church . Cambridge was a bit subtler than this . Cambridge said no one may graduate unless they belong to the established church . This is a subtle but important distinction . It meant that you could go ; you just could n't take the degree . Lots of these dissenters went and took the courses ; they just left without a degree at the end , which in those days was not as disastrous or dishonorable as it would be today . It actually retained much more of a Puritan flavor as a University than Oxford did . But there can be no doubt but that those who dissented had a rough time . In England , they were on the whole left alone most of the time . They were n't normally severely persecuted . <p> Scotland was a different story . In Scotland , the Episcopal establishment was very small indeed . The vast majority of the population was deeply opposed to it . Resistance , underground churches became very common . Therefore , the persecution in Scotland was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the killing times , the time of real persecution occurred during this period . <p> In Ireland it was a different story . What happened there was that after James I became King of England in 1603 , Ireland was opened up to Scottish settlers as well as English ones . Previously they had n't been able to go there . But from 1603 they could . This made a big difference . English people on a whole did n't want to go to Ireland , because Ireland was colder and wetter and poorer than England . But Scottish people looked at very differently , because compared to Scotland ; Ireland is warm and rich in agricultural terms . So , Scottish people poured into Ireland in a way that English people never did and in particular to the part of Ireland nearest to Scotland . Most of the Northeast of Ireland became heavily Scottish in character during this time . These people were ferociously anti-Catholic . English people were anti-Catholic , but Scottish people were much more anti-Catholic . This was difficult considering that although they were numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority of the population . <p> And when the civil government broke down in 1640 , the Catholics in Ireland rose in rebellion and attacked the Protestants . In fact there was a plot to rise up and murder every Protestant in Ireland , and it was discovered the day before . There was just time to disarm the Catholic troops , and the advantage of surprise was lost . But this convinced the Protestants of Northern Ireland that the minute they stopped looking , they 'd be murdered . So , they were very much against anything that would promote Catholic revival . <p> In 1649 , Cromwell invaded Ireland to put down the Catholics who had sided with the king . Cromwell 's policy , although it was actually quite humane , by the standards of 17th century warfare , did n't look that way to people at the time . He chose two cities : Drogheda in the northeast and Wexford down in the southeast and he besieged them , captured the garrison and put every single person to death . This was regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 . Terrible things in themselves , but it brought the war to an end . <p> More significantly , and with much more long term effect , Cromwell confiscated most of the land which still remained in Catholic hands . Catholics were deprived of the land that they owned . It was given to Protestants instead . This was a long standing grievance which was not finally solved until the 19th century when the government agreed to help Catholics buy the land back from the Protestant overlords at that time . However , the Protestant population of Ireland could be relied upon to support anything that was anti-Catholic , in a very militant way . <p> In a sense , it was less of a problem than Scotland . In Scotland there were very few Catholics ; there was no real Catholic opposition . It was a much more difficult place to control . <p> Now , as all this developed , as all of this was going on , the king as his hold on power became stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was able to do something for toleration in a way he could n't do earlier . But , he had to proceed very carefully . Basically , there was n't very much he could do in England for toleration . But it was at this time that colonial expansion began in earnest - colonial expansion organized by the state as opposed to people running away and setting up colonies . From this point you get it officially sanctioned by the government for the first time . In the colonies , Charles was able to create a situation where tolerance was permitted . <p> This is the time when you get for example , the founding of Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania was a very strange sort of place , because William Penn was a Quaker and he was allowed to have all this land in the middle of nowhere and fill it up with Quakers and people like that and there was freedom of religion , freedom of this and that . And what was most extraordinary was that in the charter given to William Penn a clause said there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no taxation to support an army . This was unique in the world at that time . Nowhere else was it possible for pacifists to go and live without being molested by a state which insisted you either have to serve as a soldier or at least pay taxes . So , you get a situation like that and other pacifists , Baptists , for example , Mennonites , the Amish , people like this begin to go there because it is a place of refuge where they are free to practice what they want to do . So Pennsylvania by the mid 1700 's was quite an unusual place . It came about because of this original tolerance , the king wanting to provide a refuge where people like that could go and be safe . The irony is that when the American Revolution came along , it was the revolutionaries who abolished this freedom . It 's often thought that the revolutionaries were fighting for freedom , but it just depended on who you were and what kind of freedom you wanted . They were incensed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these Quakers , Amish and so on who were n't going to fight . Not only were they not going to fight , they were n't going to pay taxes in order that other people could fight . And so , William Penn 's charter got torn up , and they were told that although they could be conscientious objectors themselves , they had to contribute tax money . One of the things that happened at the beginning of the American Revolution was loss of religious freedom for these people over that particular issue . <p> Other things conspired to help in this way too , because in 1664 , shortly after the restoration in England war with the Dutch resulted in the capture of the Dutch colonies in North America which were then taken over by the king 's brother . The king 's brother was the Duke of York , and therefore one of the new colonies got called New York after him . As Duke of York , one of his other titles was Lord of Jersey , so the other colony got called New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the same person who was the younger brother , James , of the king Charles II , and who succeeded him as king , as we shall see , rather disastrously when the time came . But , having taken over a colony like that where the Church of England had not existed previously because it was n't an English colony , they had to be tolerant . You had to just let the Dutch and whoever else happened to be there sort of carry on the way they always had . So tolerance was almost forced on them whether they wanted it or not . It seemed to work reasonably well . That was another unforeseen but new development leading towards a gradual retreat of the state from religious affairs . <p> In the South you find that in the 1680 's , Charles decided to found new colonies named after himself , North and South Carolina , Charleston which was the main port for these new colonies , also named after himself . In these new colonies he actually commissioned the philosopher John Locke to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official statement of religious toleration . Not total freedom of religion in the modern sense but a situation where you had on one hand an established church , The Church of England was to be the established church , the state church , but in such a way as people who did n't agree with it or people who wished to worship independently of it were tolerated , they were given freedom to do so . And they were not expected to contribute money or anything else to the upkeep of the state church . The state church would be recognized as such , but not at the expense of those who did not wish to join it . In fact , if you ever go to Charleston , it 's a very good picture still to this day of what life was like in England in the late 17th century . What you have there is two main streets . One is called Church Street . One is called Meeting Street . Meeting Street if it were England would be called Chapel Street . What you have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Episcopal Church , Phillips I think it is called . It looks as if it came out of an English village . Over here , there is a round building which deliberately does not look like a church . It 's not meant to look like a church . You are not meant to confuse the two . No spire . In England , only the state church could build buildings with spires . Which is why , in New England , all churches were built with spires in defiance or as an indication that we are the state church of New England . In Charleston , they could n't do that , because the state church had too much say in what went on . So instead you have a round building which is a kind of meeting house , rather like a church hall or something like that . What 's so interesting about this is that even now , to this day it does not belong to any one denomination . There are about 3 or 4 denominations which share it . This reflects the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official state church were not as yet organized in separate denominations . What mattered was that they had left the official establishment . There was no distinction between Presbyterians , Baptists , Congregationalist , and these kinds of divisions . They were less important than the fact that this was the independent form of worship . This was something that was not officially recognized by the state . In Charleston , that pattern remains . <p> This situation could not continue forever . The king himself realized this . This is why he tried ; his whole point of encouraging toleration in the colonies was to convince people in England that it could work . If the experiment in South Carolina was okay , then after people saw that South Carolina could survive without sort of falling apart in riot and disruption and everything else , it might get introduced in England . Well , of course we all know that never happened because South Carolina turned out to be not quite a very attractive model . Not really , not for that reason . But it was tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> Anyhow , he died in 1685 , with no legitimate heirs , and was succeeded by his brother , James , the famous Duke of York after whom New York was named . But James was another strange bird . He had been married in his early life to the daughter of Lord Clarendon who was a prominent supporter of the king during the civil war . By Lord Clarendon 's daughter he had produced two daughters , Mary and Anne . Mary had been married off to the heir to the Dutch throne , William . Anne was sort of married off to a prince of Denmark . They were all clearly and obviously Protestant . <p> James himself was a different kettle of fish . His first wife died when he was still in his 30 's . He remarried an Italian princess and converted to Catholicism , which was not really a very wise move . If you are going to become king of a very Protestant country , converting to Catholicism is not the best way to win friends and influence people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family at the time , they did n't really think about public opinion . When James finally did become king it was remarkable how many people did accept it at least in a way . They did n't want a Catholic king , but they consoled themselves in the knowledge that he had two Protestant daughters and they were going to succeed him . In the end , it probably would not make all that much difference . <p> However , James was not going to sit and wait for that to happen . He realized that he could not just legislate in favor of Catholicism , because the parliament would never accept that . He had too many people against him , not least because at the very time when he became king , the French king , Louis XIV expelled the remaining Protestants from France . The Huguenots were kicked out of France in 1685 , the same year . Many of them turned up in England . Many of them went to South Carolina . There was no question politically to favor the Catholic cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said we wo n't favor Catholicism , what we 'll do is encourage religious toleration . He issued a Declaration of Indulgence , not to be confused with Indulgences against which Martin Luther revolted , but a Declaration of Indulgence which said that everybody was free to worship God in any way that they pleased . And you might think that people would accept this . But of course , everybody realized that this was a cover , that James apparently was going to give freedom to Baptists and Quakers and people like that , was in fact using this as a way of giving freedom to Catholics , which was what his real interest was . And so , people revolted against this . They rebelled against it . James ordered the declaration to be read in every church . And the bishops of the Church of England refused . They said , no , this is unconstitutional ; we are not going to do it . So he put the bishops on trial , 7 of them , kind of a show trial to demonstrate who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have bishops of the Church of England been as popular as they were at this particular point . No one really expected this . The bishops themselves did not deserve this . They were sort of funny old men who basically should n't have been where they were . They did n't really deserve it . But they just happened to find themselves in this strange position . They were put in jail . The trial occurred . They were acquitted by the jury which took their side against the side of the king . <p> Well , this revealed that the government was breaking down , because if a jury could acquit the bishops , the parliament was clearly on the side of the church against the king , the king could not continue indefinitely in this position . He was n't going to go back to Protestantism . Things were heating up very dramatically in 1687 , 1688 . When suddenly his wife , the queen , after 15 years of marriage , produced a baby and the baby was a boy . This was a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who of course bumped the two girls into second place as heir to the throne . And James now had what nobody suspected he would ever have , which was a Catholic heir . <p> At this point , the parliament decided to act . They invited William of Orange from Holland , and Mary who was the next in line to the throne , to come to England and basically take over the government . William , of course , was just waiting for this opportunity . He landed with an army on the 5th of November of 1688 , the famous Guy Fawkes Day , and marched on London . The king panicked and fled to France . So parliament declared that he had abdicated , even though he had n't . They declared an interregnum . In February of 1689 , they made William and Mary joint sovereigns , king and queen together and established at this point that only a Protestant could sit on the throne . In other words , from this time on , no Catholic could sit on the throne of Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it was decided that the state would be Protestant officially , because no one had ever said this before , this created the circumstances in which toleration for dissenters became possible . They said to themselves , now that we are officially Protestant , and it is decreed that it shall be so , we can show tolerance to other Protestants . You do n't have to belong to the state church now in order to be given some kind of official recognition . Tolerance is not necessarily going to mean tolerance for Catholics as well . A Toleration Act was passed by parliament in 1689 , allowing for the first time people who were not members of the official church to organize as corporations , in other words to establish a legal existence . This is the beginning of denominations as we understand them today . <p> If you take for example , the Baptists " the Baptists had to get together , they had to declare who they were , what they were . They had to produce a statement of faith . That statement of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a slightly revised version , the Philadelphia Confession , that was a bit later , but still basically the same document . In 1689 this was . It was kind of their title deed to be recognized as a church . That is the beginning of the Baptist denomination in England and in the colonies . This is now given official status . The same was true for the Presbyterians , and for the Quakers and all the rest . Everybody had to do the same kind of thing , and then they were given official status . <p> They were not made equal . Other things were maintained . They could not hold public office . They could not go to university . That continued as before . But they were no longer persecuted and they were given some form of official recognition . A process which had been gradually maturing over a 100 year period reaches its conclusion with the emergence of recognizable denominational groupings . Conversely , the state church , the official church , gave up trying to pretend that everybody belonged to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were people who genuinely did not belong to it . That had never been officially accepted before . And you have a different kind of set up , religious pluralism of a kind , denominationalism is accepted as a reality rather than having different groupings fighting over recognition to be the one true church . <p> In Scotland , a different thing happened . In Scotland , they recognized that Episcopalianism was not going to wash there . So rather than that , they established Presbyterianism as the state church . So , Scotland got a different state church . Scotland became Presbyterian , and still is Presbyterian , with the Westminster Confession as its confession of faith . Episcopalians became a dissenting minority and suffered the disabilities of such . So that you have the curious situation that if you were a member of the Church of England , and you went to Scotland , you would loose your legal rights . You would have legal rights in England but not in Scotland , and visa versa . <p> In Ireland , it was a little bit more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only place he was going to get any support was in Ireland , because he was a Catholic and there were lots of Catholics in Ireland . And so all of a sudden he jumped on the Catholic bandwagon , and with the support of the king of France , raised an army and invaded Ireland . He was recognized as Catholic King of Ireland in 1689 . Now the Irish Catholics thought at last we have a Catholic king who is going to defend us and give us our rights . But James would n't do that . James was Catholic . They were Catholic . James had his eye on the English throne , and he knew that if he gave official rights to Catholics in Ireland , he would have no chance of ever becoming king of England again . So he kind of put the Irish off a little bit . The Irish were up in arms , realizing they were the ones going to loose on this score , if anybody was going to loose . <p> They could n't wait for William of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination . William more or less had to do that . He could n't tolerate a rival so near with an army . So in 1690 , William invaded Ireland with his Protestant army and with the support of the Irish Protestants , defeated the Catholics at the famous Battle of the Boyne on the 1st of July in 1690 . But , because of the change of calendars since then it is now celebrated on the 12th of July . For Protestants in Ireland to this day the 12th of July is a major public holiday . That 's when they get out their drums and bagpipes and so on and go marching through Catholic areas just to remind them of who won . It underlies the conflict there . <p> This was the beginning of the present troubles in Ireland . The Protestant take over at this point . From 1690 onward , Catholics were very severely penalized and punished in Ireland for at least 100 years because of this fear of rebellion always in favor of the legitimate king , James and his successors and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 18th century , you had James ' little boy , the one whose birth had caused all the trouble who became known as the old pretender and his son Charles , Bonnie Prince Charlie who was the young pretender , and these people actually did try on two occasions in 1715 and again in 1745 to take over the country . It was a very real fear . Throughout the 18th century there was this undercurrent that Catholics must be kept down because if they are not they might rise up in rebellion , and there is genuine cause to believe that might really happen . <p> The result in the American colonies is very interesting , because after William conquered Ireland , the government decided that this was the opportunity to sort out the Americans . It was at this time that colonies where there had been toleration , like Maryland for instance , where there had been Catholics and toleration , this was stopped . The New England colonies , Massachusetts and so on , were combined , instead of being allowed to be 4 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppress the Puritan constitution in Massachusetts . This was the time of the Salem witch hunts . These were used as an excuse . The government said if we leave it in the hands of the locals , they will just run around burning witches at the stake . We 've got to stop that . <p> A policy was adopted that gradually an attempt would be made to bring people back into the established church . The Church of England , the Episcopal Church was set up in New England for the first time . It had never existed there before . Churches were built and it was kind of intruded into New England at this point . The kind of toleration which had been granted earlier in the Carolinas was diminished and there was a genuine attempt made to press the claims of the church establishment , more than had been the case in the past . For awhile , it appeared to succeed . After 1690 for a generation or so the number of Episcopalians in the American colonies increased quite substantially . The number of churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American colonies was that in order to become a minister in the Episcopal Church , you had to go to England to be ordained , because there were no bishops in the colonies . And as long as there were no bishops in the colonies , this was a weakness because they could n't ordain everybody who wanted to be ordained . To go to England for that was a difficult thing to do . Therefore , the church had a chronic shortage of ministers . Although it was expanding in other ways , they could build buildings and so on , finding ministers , getting people to serve the churches was difficult . The only thing you could do was send people out from England to do it . It is because of that that John Wesley landed up in Savannah . He was part of that movement . He was sent to minister to the colonies . If you go to Savannah today , you get the impression that Wesley founded it . He was only there for 18 months and he was such a pain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him back to England . <p> What happened to kill the Episcopal revival was the Great Awakening . When the Great Awakening came in the 1740 's that reversed all of this . That changed the situation totally . It was in the Great Awakening that Baptists and Methodists became the main religious forces . The Episcopalians faded into the background . That was the end of that particular era.

We have this tradition , nowhere does the scripture prohibit this , therefore it is ok . <p> 2 . The Anabaptist can not be sure of their baptism because one 's faith wavers <p> C. The appeal to tradition <p> Think out loud - The possibility of infant faith . Faith a matter of the receptacle of God 's word and something other than simple cognitive work . <p> What then is the age of accountability ? How can this be determined ? SBC age gets lower and lower . <p> Saving aspect of baptism in infant baptism ? Extended to the persons of the community of faith . To believers and their children . <p> Luther says baptism is a promise not a command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here with ... <p> How does Luther know that the baptized is for the elect ? Ultimately , we have to hold in suspension the tension of the elect and non-elect . For Luther the church is made up of wheat and tares . We must focus on what/how God has revealed himself to us . Our job is to point to what He has revealed to us in the word .

As opposed the Systematic Theology , Biblical Theology asks the question of what a particular book , or group of books , teach on different topics , showing emphases of the different parts of Scripture . <h> Gospels <p> 8 . Common Theological Themes in the Synoptic Gospels . Common themes in the synoptic Gospels are the " kingdom of God , " and a shift from the " old covenant " to the " new covenant .

A description of the teachings of Jesus , showing they were in contrast to what was promoted in the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings of the Torah . <p> 10 . Christology in the Synoptics : What Jesus Thought About Himself . Jesus claimed to be God by the titles he used to refer to himself , by what he said and did , and by dying and then coming back to life . The Gospels record that the evidence for the divinity of Jesus was so overwhelming , that even Jews who had a strong tradition in worshiping one God who is a spirit , were compelled to worship Jesus as God , even though he was a man . <p> 11 . Distinctive Theologies in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew . The Gospel of Mark focuses on Jesus as miracle worker , prophet and suffering servant . Matthew focuses on Jesus as the Jewish Messiah . The Gospel of Matthew includes much of Mark 's material as well as some accounts that are unique to Matthew . <p> 12 . Distinctive Theologies in the Gospel of Luke .

Two of the themes Paul emphasizes throughout his epistles are the glory of God in Christ and God being magnified in Christ . Paul preaches to both Jews and Gentiles and emphasizes these truths in a way that each group can understand . He also explains God 's call on his life and the authority God has given him to preach the gospel . <p> 15 . Paul 's Teaching on Sin . The core idea of sin is refusing to honor and praise God .

The resurrection and ascension of Jesus demonstrated that Jesus is Lord . Philippians 2:6-11 and Colossians 1:15-20 are passages that teach that Jesus is both fully man and fully God .

Election excludes works as a reason for God choosing you . God 's calling always results in salvation . God 's calling is a tremendous example of his love for you . Paul encourages people to live the Christian life by being filled with the Holy Spirit . He also emphasizes the importance of persevering to the end . <p> 18 . Live for the Glory of God . Paul 's letters contain commands about some specific behaviors as well as general exhortations to be filled with the Holy Spirit and act out of a motivation of love .

This principle , however , has much more to do with the large question of authority than the more intricate matter of dealing with the text of Scripture . <p> A. The Ninety-Five Theses <p> 1 . At this time he was still giving deference to the Pope , the magesterium and the Councils <p> 2. 1517 was not at the place to make the bold statement of Scripture alone . <p> 3. 1519 in the Leipzeg debate Luther is pressed to admit that Popes and Councils have erred , therefore , scripture is the alone <p> B.

Nothing should be added to the word of scripture . <p> b . Scripture has one center , Christ . <p> c . Monastic distinction of foods .

Augustine had once said , " I should not believe the gospel if I did not believe the Church . " - What if he erred ? If this is his opinion , he contradicts himself ?

Typically Luther speaks about the fourfold sense of Scriptures . <p> A. The need for allegorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine <p> Origen <p> B. The letter let 's you know what happened , the allegory what you must believe , the moral sense what you do , and the anagogical what you may hope for .

What is certain is that Luther gives definite place to 2 Corinthians 3:6 . <p> A. Tradition understood the letter in the mere historical sense . To get the real meaning of scripture one needed to move beyond the letter , the earthly , to the spirit . This caused the interpreter to look for the spiritual or allegorical meaning of the text . <p> B. Luther reverses this hermeneutic by asserting that the text does not mean something , it accomplishes something . The letter kills , the Spirit gives life .

@@35723590 @4723590/ <h> Proverbs <h> I. Overview <p> Now we are shifting gears to talk about Proverbs . Not totally shifting gears because we have already talked about the idea of wisdom . Here is a quick overview of Proverbs in terms of how the book is structured . <p> A. Importance of Wisdom ( 1-9 ) : Nine chapters have in them some short and long poems about the importance of seeking wisdom . You just want to get a sense of the right choices and the wrong choices . If you do not have that , how are you going to make the right choices ? As we will see the right choices always start with believing in God . The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom , says Proverbs . A crucial statement . <p> B. Proverbs of Solomon ( 10-22 ) : Then you have some Proverbs of Solomon , the biggest , single chunk in the book . <p> C. Words of the Wise ( 22-24 ) : Then , interestingly , a section that is just called " Words of the Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taught a lot about making right choices . <p> D. More Words of the Wise ( 24:23-34 ) : Then more of those for twelve verses . <p> G. Words of Lemuel ( 31:1-9 ) : The words of Lemuel . Agur and Lemuel are both called kings . If you look in the books of 1 and 2 Kings you will look in vain for Agur and Lemuel , because they are Arab kings . You might then say , " Wait a minute . What are Arab kings doing contributing to the Bible ? The answer is : this is something about Proverbs you need to appreciate . Solomon was probably much more a collector than an author in the sense of actually making up Proverbs . Did he make up many ? Sure , undoubtedly made up many ; more than anybody else , but he basically was a collector . God inspired him and if there were others who had any role to play in collecting the book , and there may have been , because there is a reference at one point in Proverbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hezekiah comes at the end of the eighth century so he is at least one hundred and fifty years after Solomon . If some good stuff about the choices in life was available out there among the Arab contacts that Solomon had . Remember the Queen of Sheba ; she is an Arabian queen who comes to Solomon . If it is out there , God can use it . Did Solomon , perhaps , clean up some of it ? Did he add emphasis on the Lord , the God of Israel ? Sure , but the origins are wherever they may come from . We can spot a very few , but there is a few , little parallels between some proverbs in Egyptian literature and things that we have in the book of Proverbs . Some of those were worth borrowing and putting in a good context . <p> H. A Godly Woman ( 31:10-31 ) : Then , finally , the book ends with the praise of a godly woman . <h> II . Themes of the Book <p> Look at these themes and let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel , really was not a dangerous thing to do . If done carefully , it is perfectly legitimate . There are themes in Proverbs like number nine here which I have ended with the fear of Yahweh , the fear of the Lord that are , of course , orthodox Israelite themes that are not going to come from Arabs ; as far as we know , most of whom did not worship Yahweh in any way . Some of the things are like that . But look at some of these themes like good speech , family matters , hard work versus laziness , the rich versus the poor , being proud versus being humble . These are things that are , to some considerable degree , shared human wisdom concerns . In other words , the book of Proverbs is as much a kind of an all-purpose book for living and not specifically a book for instruction in theology that makes it stand apart to some degree from other books . The special purpose of Proverbs is to bring up young people and to teach them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , I would say to you if you are heading into youth ministry , Proverbs is the book in the Bible to help youth get it ; to get what life is all about , to get the basics . To learn that you must make the decisions between wisdom and folly . That there is such a thing as righteousness and there is such a thing as wickedness . There is real evil and to know what it looks like . To know how important their speech is . To know how important it is that they relate properly within their family . That someday when they are a husband or a wife , a father or a mother they will have a crucial role to play in the lives of people that will be precious to them . And about the importance of hard work . <p> Proverbs would not require you to be converted to Christ to get a lot of the points . It really does not . Proverbs is much more , sort of , all-purpose . What is great about Proverbs is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they have made their decision to follow Christ as Lord and Savior . That is a fact . Those of you who have no children yet may have not even ever thought about this . I have had more children than anybody I know because my wife and I not only have had eight , four biological and four adopted , but we raised another dozen as foster children . We just have so many kids I can hardly remember their names . I look at them and say , " You are ? " But almost all Christian parents face the fact that they are raising their kids at one stage or another who are not necessarily living for Christ . Some eleven year old or some eighteen year old or whatever , they may be very far from Christ . How do you relate to them ? You still need to raise them up with these basic values , basic truths , a basic sense of choices and so on . They should not be proud , they ought to be humble . They ought to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to work hard and honor the boss and be a good employee , etc . If they are a boss , they ought to know how to be a kind boss and a fair boss , etc . Ultimately what you want is that they learn the fear of the Lord . They really get converted because that is the beginning point of all wisdom ultimately . If you want to be oriented to right and wrong , to be oriented to God is the best orientation there could possibly be for having all the other orientations fit . But still this can work . If you have got a youth group or a children 's ministry or a Christian education ministry with a lot of kids who are not yet converted you can still use this material . It does not require for its applicability and its value that they have really made a decision to follow Christ . Of course that is ideal , of course it is perfect , but there is a lot you can do without that . I really encourage this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is that as we are eating dinner I will just grab the Bible and I will read a Proverb . I will just pick a Proverb at random . Often times it is just a Proverb that my eye falls on , I will do it now , I will give you a proverb like I do it at home . I will say to the kids , " It says here a wicked messenger falls into trouble , but a trustworthy envoy brings healing . " Then I will say to my son Jonathan , who is now 14 , " Okay Jonathan , what does that mean ? " He will say predictably , " I do n't know . " Then I will read it again . " It says here , Proverbs 13:17 , ' A wicked messenger falls into trouble , but a trustworthy envoy brings healing . ' " Then my wife and I will start explaining what is a messenger , what is an envoy , teach him vocabulary and so on . Then I will turn to some of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? " Then one of them will get it or get part of it and together we will work it out and then I will explain it , and it is a wonderful statement . Here is a statement about somebody who is a gossip or who is somehow giving false information or conveying things in a way that is harmful that gets people in trouble as opposed to the faithful , trustworthy envoy who can bring healing . When you handle the truth correctly and diplomatically huge amounts of good can happen . You want to hurt people , boy can you hurt them by just the way you say , " Do you know what so and so said about you the other night at Bible study ? " Oh man , that is dynamite . Make it up . You could start a thing that would take years to die down . <h> III . Proverbs are puzzles . <p> One little detail , proverbs are essentially puzzles . This is important to get . A proverb is not intended to be simple to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to soluble so it is not a puzzle that just makes you say , " I do n't know ; I have no idea what this says . " A reasonable adult can always figure it out and explain it to a thoughtful child or adolescent . It is important to appreciate , however , in the way Proverbs are written--it is much more visible in the Hebrew , by the way , than it is in the English because the English often does kind of half explain it in the translation . English translators look for clarification , but in the original they are like puzzles . They are so terse and they have such unusual expressions and themes and metaphors that often they make no sense . Some of you who have learned English as a second language or have come from other cultures know this . You have heard many things that people say and you say , " What does that mean ? " For example Americans say , " A stitch in time saves nine . " It is an American and British proverb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a nice sense to it . What is the meaning ? It has very little to do with sewing . It is not really a sewing proverb at all . You do not have to watch the Sewing Channel to understand this proverb . It is about the fact that from a literal point of view , a literalistic point of view , when a garment starts to unravel if you can quickly stitch it then much more unraveling will be stopped and one stitch in time saves nine stitches . Does it also save fourteen ? Sure . Does it save thirty-eight ? Sure . Does it save two ? Yes . So it is not just nine . But it sort of rhymes to say , " A stitch in times saves nine , " so that is the way it is put together to make it memorable but the real point of that proverb is that there are many kinds of situations that will get worse and worse and worse if you let them go but if you act quickly you can often prevent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many problems the easier they will be to solve . That is what a stitch in time really means . We say it in kind of a puzzle way . I sure that most kids as they are growing up , even kids who have heard that all their life , the first time they heard it said , " What , I do n't get it . " So you have to explain it . Proverbs are like that . We believe that when people taught proverbs to kids , again and again and again they would say , " Teacher , would you explain that one too please ? " It had to be puzzled out . But you know what is wonderful , if you have something you have to puzzle out , we find this at the dinner table whenever we do it with our kids , it makes an impact because you are repeating it . You say , " Now listen to that first part again . What do you think that means ? " You are going over it , you are repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to solve the puzzle . This is what helps commit it to memory . Something that is easy to solve just sort of goes in one ear and out the other , which is also a kind of an English proverb ; an expression for it does not last in your memory . A thing that you have to work on , think about , analyze . What is the point of that ? I do n't get it . Why is it stated that way ? That is just great in terms of helping you to get the concept and likely remember it . In the Hebrew the proverbs are very , very memorizable . They are like " a stitch in time saves nine " or " look before you leap . " They are short , they are very epigrammatic , they are very condensed , they often have similar sounds and cadences and they are put in a word order that you can easily remember . Like , " Roses are red , violets are blue , sugar is sweet and who are you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . There are a lot of those things that we do not have in English but we still have the puzzle factor , the need to go over it , the concept and the tremendous value for believer and nonbeliever alike , which is a great thing . <h> IV . Context of Warnings <p> One does have to be careful in the genre . I think in the wisdom literature , the warnings against prostitution , harlotry and so on are basically warnings in favor of sexual fidelity and purity . In the prophets the term harlotry , prostitution is usually metaphorical referring to polytheism . Where you use a term makes a very big difference in its applicability . I was giving the illustration in another class today--suppose you saw in a newspaper the following : Pittsburgh eliminates Detroit . If that were not on a sports page or a sport story it could be real serious . " Good grief , Pittsburgh attacked Detroit and eliminated them with atomic weapons or something . " On a sports page , however , it means they knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playoffs . It has another kind of a meaning ; it is using language in the context of the field of sports and it is not the city of Pittsburgh at all , it is the Pittsburgh Penguins or whoever it is . It is some particular team , a very small organization , a very small number of people from Pittsburgh actually who work in Pittsburgh . ( They are from Canada if they are Penguins . ) The context is a huge part of the meaning of something . In the prophets a word is going to have this kind of value in that context whereas over in the proverbs or wisdom literature in general it will have another . <h> V. Sexual Purity and Choosing a Spouse <p> One of the big issues in wisdom literature is sexual purity and so Proverbs ends with the advice about how wonderful it is to make the right choice about life 's biggest choice from a human point of view . Life 's biggest choice is choosing God ultimately . But the biggest choice that people tend to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of a spouse . You end the book with this advice that it is so important to find a godly wife . All of Proverbs like the law and everything is always in the second person singular but do not think it is not automatically reversible . I think everybody in ancient Israel would have understood that that teaching advised a woman to find a godly husband as well . Just to make the appropriate changes so that the concepts would still essentially be helpful . Choosing a mate is crucial . Then one watches teenagers do this and it is basically who you feel comfortable with in the back seat of a car . That is the decision-making ability . It is just incredible how badly they make the decisions . It is amazing what you see . Any of you who have any pastoral experience know a big part of your time is spent in counseling people who not only made strange decisions preparing for marriage , but are continuing to make strange decisions in marriage . This is the biggest decision of life and people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of Proverbs ? Nothing about anybody 's looks . Do not make it based on looks . Nothing about any number of things like , " Aw , she is a great dancer , that is a good reason to marry her . " It is about the quality , the character , the competence , the willingness to work hard , the willingness to take care of the family and provide , the willingness to be a partner to you , the willingness to be helpful . It is just a whole other set of values that the wise person uses to make the right choices . <h> VI . A Useful Proverb <p> Let me end up on Proverbs and I know there is so many other things we could talk about . <p> Let me end up with a little story about a Proverb that did me much good . When I grew up my Dad taught me a Proverb . He taught me some Proverbs , I suppose , like do n't play in the street is sort of a proverb . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard that from when I was a little kid because my dad had some guns and that was a rule . For years I would keep asking him , " Come on Dad , mine is not loaded , look it 's empty . " He would not hear me . He would say , " No , Doug , every gun is loaded . " What was he teaching me ? Technically it was not true but he was teaching me an attitude about a gun . He was saying , " Treat every gun as if it is loaded . " It is something his dad had taught him . This was very useful to me when I shot a hole in my underwear . Let me describe it . I am home from college , I am a freshman at some obscure university in Cambridge , Massachusetts and I am home from college and I brought along two or three weeks worth of laundry , mostly underwear . I have got it in a bag and I come down to the basement with this bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washing machine where my mom will do it for me . Was n't that wonderful ? Talk about a saint . Anyway , and I see that my dad has a new gun in there . This is great . He has got it loaded with birdshot ; I do not know that . I look at the gun and determine by breaking it open , Ah ha ! There is absolutely nothing I can see . The light at the other end of the chamber , the whole thing is just absolutely empty , you can see right through the barrel . I was seeing the reflection of the light bulb behind me on the nice , shiny end of the round that was in there . If you ever have a gun , all the men in the room know this and the women just have to trust us ; this is true . You can not just hold a gun ; you have to see how it fires . You just have to . You have to feel what we call , " the action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the heft . You just have to squeeze that trigger and just feel how it clicks . I had it up and was holding it out right against the window of the basement ; the window looks out into our backyard , nice , big picture window . I was looking out there and thought , " No , I better not . " That came to my mind , " every gun is loaded , " as proverbs are supposed to . They are supposed to come to mind . They are simple , they are short . They are not always technically true like a stitch in time saves nine ; it could be a hundred , it could be one , sometimes it does not save anything . So I said every gun is loaded and I aimed , instead , down at my underwear and it went off and I shot a whole bunch of birdshot and it did not do too much damage to anything but my underwear ; I had a lot of holes in my underwear . Proverbs have that value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we have rules for driving on a highway ? Because it saves lives to have rules and to have them strictly enforced . Why do you have rules in Proverbs for how to live and to make the right choices ? Because it saves people from miseries of all sorts . Proverbs , in that sense of having these rules that are just generally applicable , is in some ways the most secular book in the Bible . It is not really secular , I do not mean that , but it is more nearly secular . Maybe that is a safer way to say it , because it does certainly have an awful lot that could apply to the nonbeliever and be useful to the nonbeliever . So certainly in youth work , in raising children , it is a great device and I do commend it to you .

Now , there are a lot of people who have a radical view of who Jesus thought he was . He thought he was some sort of a semi-prophet or the like but the understanding that we 're having from our gospels would be very different . When we talk about Christology and Jesus ' understanding of himself , we usually refer to the implicit Christology and the explicit Christology . Implicit Christology involves what he reveals of himself and his understanding of himself by his actions , deeds and words . Explicit Christology deals with what he reveals concerning his understanding of himself by the use of various titles . So , when we 're talking about his use of the word Christ or Lord or something like that to refer to himself , that 's explicit Christology . Implicit Christology is the implications of what his actions and deeds reveal about himself . <p> There 's a very well-known story called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been made into film and so forth , but it 's a story of a young prince who , one day , being led through the village nearby , saw a street urchin " a poor boy who looked just like him , and so when he " when he returns to the castle , he tells one of the people who works under him and is looking after him , " I want you to bring that pauper boy here to the castle but bring him here secretly . " So , the pauper is brought to the " see the prince in the castle , and when they both see each other , they are amazed because they are identical . They look alike . They look like they 're identical twins . They 're not but it looks like that , and the prince says to the pauper , " I 've always wanted to know what it would be like to live in the village . I want you to change places with me for a while , and I want to take your clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like in that respect , and you can take on my clothes and you can experience what it means to be a prince . " <p> Well , the street urchin thinks that 's great , so he does it , and he lives in the castle and makes all sorts of mistakes and so forth , but what 's interesting is that the pauper is now dressed like a street urchin but he keeps on getting in trouble because he keeps acting like a prince because he knows he 's a prince and he ca n't act any other way than the prince . Now , there 's a sense in when we talk about the implicit Christology of Jesus . He who emptied himself and took upon himself the form of a street urchin comes to earth , and yet the way he acts is like a way that you would not allow other people to act because he acts differently , and in his actions , he reveals something of who he thinks he is , and we 're gon na look at the implicit Christology from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn with me to page 241 in your synopsis , and we have here the question about Jesus ' authority that is evoked by his actions . He acts in a way that we do n't allow people to act . Reading Mark here , page 241 , " And they came again to Jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him and they said to him , ' By what authority are you doing these things , ' " or , " ' who gave you the " this authority to do them ? He has cleansed the temple ' " , and now in response , there is a question , " Who gave you the authority to do this in the temple ? " Now , there are three sacred aspects of Israel that identifies the people of Israel . One is the temple . The other is the law , and the third is their Sabbaths , and Jesus , in his actions , acts as if he 's master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple and he cleanses it . Who gave you the right to do this ? It 's a natural question , and Jesus responds here . He says , " Well , okay I 'll " I 'll ask you a question , and then if you answer that , I 'll answer yours . The baptism of John , was it from heaven or from men , " and they said , " Well , you know , if we say it 's from heaven , then they 'll say , ' Well , then why did n't you guys get baptized by him , ' and if we say , ' Well , it 's not from heaven " not from God " in other words , but from men , then everybody around here will get angry because they all believe John 's a prophet . ' " So , they say , " Well , you know we do n't know , " and Jesus then gives up and said , " There 's no sense in my answering the question either because your hearts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't answer you either , " but his attitude towards the temple that he is master of the temple reveals that he believes he is someone unique . He has authority to cleanse the temple . He possesses authority over the demons who he casts out , and he claims to have authority over Satan himself " 108 in your synopsis . <p> Now , begi " reading in Mark 3:22 , line 11 , the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He is bes " uh , possessed by Belzaboul , the name of the chief demon , and by the prince of demons , Belzaboul , he casts out the demons , and he called them to him and said to them in parables , " How can Satan cast out Satan if the kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand , and if the house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand , and if Satan has risen up against himself , he is divided and he can not stand but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But no one can enter the strong man 's house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man , then indeed he may plunder his house . " Now , Jesus is saying that he is plundering the domain of s " Belzaboul , and , therefore , he must be stronger than Belzaboul in this regard . It does n't say who he is . No titles are used , but he says , " My activity here indicates that I am stronger than he , and , therefore , that 's why I 'm able to plunder his house . " He reveals his authority over disease by healing , and it 's a manifold number of kinds of disease . Uh , it 's not that it 's " he 's specializes in one thing that he can say , " Well , it 's kind of a " a psychic kind of help . " No , there are different kinds of diseases he heals . Uh , he is a general practitioner , not a specialist in that regard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , before we read the passage on page 44 as to Jesus ' activity on the Sabbath , I think one thing I want to do is to read some background materials to indicate the Jewish reverence for the Sabbath . I do n't think there 's anybody that we know in Baptist circles that has any respect for Sunday or our Sabbath like the Pharisees and the " and the Jews in general had during the time of Jesus . In the books of the Apocrypha , there 's a book called First Maccabees , and in First Maccabees , 2:32 to 41 , it tells about an incident in which the Jews are at war with the Syrians , and led by the Maccabees , they are resisting the Syrians who want to stamp out their religion or religious identity , and so they are essentially fighting a guerilla warfare . <p> Now , we read , " Many pursued them and overtook them . They encamped opposite them " " the Jewish people " " and prepared for battle against them on the Sabbath day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , come out and do what the king commands and you will live . " In other words , there 's no sense resisting us . The Syrians are saying , " If you just do what the king demands , you 'll be all right , " but they said , " We will not come out , nor will we do what the king commands , " and so profane the Sabbath day . Then , the enemy hastened to attack , but they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding places for they said , " Let us all die in our innocence . Heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly . " <p> So , they attack the Jews that " the Jews are being attacked . " So , the Syrians attack the Jews on the Sabbath , and they died with their wives and children and cattle to the number of a thousand persons . " In other words , the Jews did not resist . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't work on the Sabbath . They " they " a thousand people died . <p> Now , when Mattathias , the father of the Maccabeeans " Maccabeean leaders , and his friends learned of it , they mourned for them deeply and each said to his neighbor , " If we all do as our brethren have done 09:30 and refuse to fight with the gentiles for our lies and for our ordinances , they will quickly destroy us from the earth . " I mean if we do n't fight them , they 'll just fight on Sundays and we just " uh , Saturdays I should say " the Sabbath , and we 'll be destroyed . So , they made this decision that day . Let us fight against every man who comes to attack us on the Sabbath day . Let us not die as our brethren died in their hiding places . So , they make this decision . We will fight to save our lives on the Sabbath . We 're not going to attack on the Sabbath , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives on the Sabbath . Now , think of the attitude you have towards the Sabbath . Needless to say , you do n't do frivolous things like have touch football on a Saturday or something like that , but to save your life , you may do it . <p> When the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered , there was a work called the Fragments of a Zadokite Work , and in it , it reads this way " let me read it to you first how it was translated , and then I 'll tree " read it to you the way it really is . Uh , in the translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls by Vermes and Dupont-Sommer , we read , " Should any man fall into water or fire , let him be pulled out with the aid of a ladder or a rope or such tool . " Yet , there 's a little footnote that they have amended the reading because the reading really reads this way , " If a man falls into a pit or ditch , he shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in a place near to the gentiles on the Sabbath . No man shall suffer himself to be polluted on the Sabbath for the sake of wealth or gain . If any person falls into a place of water , he shall not bring him up by a ladder or a cord or an instrument . " In other words , the translators , when they came to this , could n't believe it . So , they translated it according to what they thought would be sensible , and that was that if the person fell into a " a pit on the Sabbath day , then you go and bring him up , but it really says you do n't bring him up , but they could not conceive of this attitude towards the Sabbath , but see , they 're reading their understanding of Sabbath and Sunday or something like that into the Assam community and the Assam said , " When you see somebody who 's fallen into a pit and it 's on the Sabbath , you can go down and say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but you ca n't help him . " Now , that 's an attitude towards the Sabbath that 's very hard for us to contemplate . <p> You have , on the other hand , another one " let 's see , uh " This Jubilees 2:19 , " And God said to us , ' Behold , I will separate you unto Myself a people from among all " from among all the peoples , and these shall keep the Sabbath day , and I will sanctify them unto Myself as My people , and will bless them , and I have sanctified the Sabbath day and do sanctify unto Myself , even so will I bless them . They will be My people . " The Sabbath is special . It identifies God 's people because they keep the Sabbath . It 's one of the three most precious identifying features of being a Jew . <p> Now , read the account of Plucking Grain on the Sabbath . One Sabbath , he was going through the grain fields , and as they made their ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , " Look , what are you doing " what is n't " look , why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? " Now , the disciples are doing it , but they 're disciples of Jesus , and a teacher is responsible for the behavior of his pupils . Good grief , that 's scary , is n't it ? <p> So " so , anyways , in " in the day of Jesus , and Jesus said to them , " Have you never read what David did when he was in need and was hungry , he and those who were with him , how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the of bread of the Presence , which it is not lawful for any but the priest to eat , and he also gave to those who were with him , " and he said , " The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath , so the son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples can do on the Sabbath what the law does not permit because he is master of the Sabbath . How is it that he can make such claims ? Well , he has an understanding of himself of being quite unique . <p> Another thing that Jesus has is " does is assume a certain divine priority . Turn to page 40 here . In the healing of the paralytic , reading beginning at Verse 1 when he returned to Capernaum after some days , it was reported that he was at home , and many were gathered together so that there was no longer room for them , not even about the door , and he was preaching the Word to them , and they came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men , and when they could not get near Him because of the crowd , they removed the roof above him , and when they had made an opening , they let down the para " pallet on which the paralytic lay , and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Now , some of the scribes were standing there questioning in their hearts , " Why does this man speak this ? It 's blasphemy . Who can forgive sins but God alone , " and , immediately , Jesus perceiving this spirit that they thus question within themselves said to them , " Why do you question thus in your hearts ? What is easier to say to the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Rise , take up your bed and walk ? ' " Well , it 's actually easier to say " Your sins are forgiven . " It 's harder to do , but it 's easier to say because if you say , " Your sins are forgiven , " okay , so " but if you say , " Rise , take up your bed and walk , " and the guy lays there , then you know you ca n't do it . So , it 's easier to say it but harder to do it . " But that you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive sins , " he said to the paralytic , " I say to you , ' Rise , take up your pallet and go home , ' and he rolls immediately , took up his pallet and went away before them , and they were all amazed and glorified God saying , ' We never saw anything like this . ' " <p> Now , keep your finger there but turn to page 105 where we have another account like this . It 's a different story about the woman who anoints Jesus ' feet and washes them with her tears . Let 's see , the verse that I 'm looking at is " turn to page 106 " after the woman washes his feet and the , uh " Simon says , " Well , I " if this guy was really a prophet , this Jesus , he would n't " he would know what kind of woman it was and he would n't allow this to happen , " and Jesus said , " Well , you know , let me tell you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One owed a great amount . One owed a smaller amount . The man who owned the greater amount , he forgave all , and he forgave the man with the smaller debt all . Who do you think loved him more , " and he says , " Well , I guess the one who o " owed the greatest debt " debt , " and Jesus says beginning on line 44 , " You have judged rightly . " <p> Then turning toward the woman , he said to Simon , " Do you see this woman ? I entered your house , you gave me no water for my feet , but she has wet my feet with but her tears and wiped them with her hair . You gave me no kiss , but from the time I came in , she has not ceased to kiss my feet . You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment , therefore , I tell you her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves little , and he said to her , ' Your sins are forgiven . ' Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves , ' Who is this who even forgives sins ? ' " <p> Now , going back to Mark , it 's worded , " Who can forgive sins but God alone ? " Jesus claims he can forgive sins . There have been some who said that what you have to understand is your sins are forgiven are a divine passive , all right ? Divine passive " what would it mean then ? Your sins are forgiven are " God forgives you of your sins . That 's what some exegetes are saying Jesus is saying , but that 's not the way the audience understands this . They are not saying , " How does he know God has forgiven her her sins , " but rather , " How can he , personally , forgive a person their sins ? " So , it 's not a divine passive . In the story , it 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the second account " Luke " same kind of incident where he personally forgives sins . <p> Now , in the Protestant tradition , the understanding that only God can forgive sins is very much dominant and emphasized . In a Protestant tradition , the p " pastor will never say something like , " By the authority invested in me by the state of Kentucky , I forgive you your sins , " or something like that , you know ? They will say rather , " Because the Bible says that if we confess our sins , God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness . Therefore , be assured that God has heard our confession and He has forgiven us our sins . " <p> So , in a Protestant setting , a pastor may pronounce God 's forgiveness unlike in the Roman Catholic setting where a priest will say " I " I forgive you of your sins on this condition , " or something like that . So , that distinction that only God can forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition than in the Catholic tradition , but here 's Jesus , and they say , " Only God can forgive a person their sins , " and Jesus says , " Well , I can and I 'll show you . " What 's easier to say ? <p> Now , if Jesus can forgive sins , it will be demonstrated by the fact that he now heals this person with God 's help and God 's strength , and that this now , the healing , is God 's certification that Jesus ' statement is correct . So , Jesus can forgive sins , although , no human can forgive sins . None of us as humans have the right to forgive a person their sins . We can declare God 's forgiveness . Jesus personally forgives in these two accounts . He does n't pronounce God 's , you know " it " it " if , uh " if this was a misunderstanding by the opponents of Jesus , then Jesus could have solved the problem very easily and said , " You misunderstood me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins , " and the whole thing would be blown away , but he does n't say that . He says , " I 'll show I have the authority to do this . " So , here you have another implicit Christology in the actions of Jesus by which he forgives the sins of the woman in the one instance , the man in the other . <p> All right , well , let 's go then to the next aspect of the Christology of Jesus and that has to do with the words of Jesus . Now , here we have Jesus teaching , uh " turn with me to page 52 where we have these statements concerning the uh " his authority over the law " page 52 and following " okay , beginning at 5:21 , " You have heard that it was Setavold ph you shall not kill , and whoever killed shall be liable to judgment , but I say to you , " " next page , 527 " " You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , you 've heard that it was said of men of old you shall not swear falsely but shall perform to the Lord what you swear , but I say to you , ' You have heard that it was said ' " 538 " ' an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , ' but I say to you " 543 " ' You have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy , ' but I say to you . " Think of Sunday going to church and the pastor preaches and he said , ' It 's been said in the Bible the following , but I 'm telling you . " What ? Has he lost his mind ? What 's going on ? No one can do that . The Word of God stands by itself . We are subject to the Word of God , but Jesus , has , " You 've heard it said , but I say . " <p> You have in John " excuse me " Mark 10:2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Jesus is asked a question and he " and they say , " No , the " the Bible says the following , ' Moses allowed a " a man to write a certificate of divorce , ' " in lines 6 and 7 , " ' and to put her away , ' but Jesus said to them , ' For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment , ' " but God does n't intend that , and then you have in Verse 11 , line 26 , the next page , " And he said to them , ' Whoever divorces his wife and mo " and marries another , commits adultery against her . ' " So , you have Jesus here saying , " The Bible says this , but I am telling you this . " <p> In 1:43 , a passage which we had a , uh " one of our exercises on , you have the story of Jesus criticizing , uh , the Pharisees and the Scribes , and then in Verses 14 to 23 , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " from outside which defiles a man in " by entering into him , but the things coming out of the man defiles him , " and then he says in line 79 , Verse 18 , " Then are you also without understanding ? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside can not defile him since it enters not his heart but his stomach , and so it passes on , " and then Mark puts the comment , ' Thus He , Jesus , declared all foods clean . " Jesus is saying what the Old Testament teaches here is no longer applicable . Boy , and he does n't explain it on the basis of what Paul writes in Galatians or something like that , except he says , " I 'm telling you it o " it 's over . " <p> Who is the man that can go about in saying that the scriptures are under his authority , and that he can do away with things if he so feels like it ? I have that also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a number of times " oh , I should n't say a number of times , but once I particularly use that description as a sub-chapter heading , the totalitarian claim of Jesus , and my editor changed it . He could n't handle it because when you think of totalitarian , you think of uh a Hitler , a Stalin , a Mussolini somebody who says all of life should surround me . I am the single most important in life . All of life rotates around me , but that was just the point that I was trying to make by the " by the work . That 's the way Jesus talks . He talks as if all of life should center around him . <p> Now , I 'm not willing to let some demigod say that , " I stand before you mother and father .

@@35723647 @4723647/ <h> Chapter XVIII : The Common Operation of the Holy Spirit : Common Grace <p> The study of the work of redemption wrought by Christ is naturally followed by a discussion of the application of this redemption to the hearts and lives of sinners by the special operation of thy Holy Spirit . Before taking this up a brief chapter will be devoted to the general operations of the Holy Spirit , as these are seen in common grace . <h> 1 . Nature of Common Grace <p> When we speak of common grace , we have in mind either ( a ) those general operations of the Holy Spirit whereby He , without renewing the heart , exercises such a moral influence on man that sin is restrained , order is maintained in social life , and civil righteousness is promoted ; or ( b ) those general blessings which God imparts to all men without any distinction as He sees fit . In distinction from the Arminians we maintain that common grace does not enable the sinner to perform any spiritual good , nor to turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by man , and is always more or less resisted , and at best affects only the externals of social , civil , moral , and religious life . While Christ died for the purpose of saving only the elect , nevertheless the whole human race , including the impenitent and the reprobate , derive great benefits from His death . The blessings of common grace may be regarded as indirect results of the atoning work of Christ . <h> 2 . Means of Common Grace <p> Several means may be distinguished : ( a ) The most important of these is the light of God 's general revelation . Without this all other means would be impossible and ineffective . It lightens every man , and serves to guide the conscience of the natural man . ( b ) Human governments also serve this purpose . According to our Confession they are instituted to curb evil tendencies , and to promote good order and decency. ( c ) Public opinion is another important means wherever it is in harmony with the law of God . It has a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judgment of public opinion . ( d ) Finally , divine punishments and rewards also serve to encourage moral goodness in the world . The punishments often check the sinful deeds of men , and the rewards spur them on to do what is good and right . <h> 3 . The Effects of Common Grace <p> The following effects may be ascribed to the operation of common grace : ( a ) The execution of the sentence of death on man is deferred . God did not at once fully execute the sentence of death on the sinner , and does not do so now , but gives him time for repentance , Rom. 2:4 ; II Pet . 8:9. ( b ) Sin is restrained in the lives of individuals and nations The corruption that entered human life through sin is retarded and not yet permitted to complete its destructive work , Gen. 20:6 ; 31:7 ; Job 1:12 ; 2:6. ( c ) Man still has some sense of the true , the good , and the beautiful , appreciates this in a measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain forms of religion , Rom. 2:14 , 15 ; Acts 17:22.

( e ) All men receive numerous undeserved blessings from God , Ps. 145:9 , 15 , 16 ; Matt. 5:44 , 45 ; Luke 6:35 , 36 ; Acts 14:16 , 17 ; I Tim . 4 ; 10 . <h> To memorize . Passages proving : <p> a .

@@35723687 @4723687/ <h> What does the Old Testament have to say about missions ? <p> Submitted by Timothy Tennent on Tue , 2012-06-26 05:34 <p> The mission of God lies behind the whole of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament and the particular task which we call missions today . So one of the earlier texts we will look at is the text in Genesis 12 , because in that text we find the tremendous revelation of Yahweh to Abraham where he reveals to Abraham a covenantal promise which is marked by Gods initiative . In that covenant , which is Genesis 12:1-3 , God makes three promises to Abraham which are repeated on several occasions to Abraham and again through Isaac and through Jacob . He promises Abraham that He will bless him personally . That is to say , there is a numerical blessing . Abraham is one person . His wife Sarah is childless . Yet we read that God is going to multiply his descendents and make them as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this personal , numerical blessing made to Abraham . But secondly , it is not only a personal blessing made to Abraham , it also comes as a national blessing with specific geographic implications . He promises Abraham that he will take possession of the gates of their enemies , that he will become a mighty nation , his descendents would take possession of the land which we now call the Promised Land , the land promised to Abraham . So there 's a numerical blessing to Abraham , there 's a national blessing to the people of Israel , and then , thirdly , there 's this marvelous spiritual blessing to " all nations on the earth . " That text , Genesis 12 , which says , " And in your seed all peoples on earth will be blessed through you " cf. Genesis 22:18 ; 26:24 ; 28:14 . <p> So this is a passage which is extremely important and is repeated to Abraham at several important junctures . For example , in Genesis 22:1718 he says these words : " I will surely bless you and make your descendents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand on the seashore . " That is the numerical blessing . Secondly he tells him , continuing in v. 17 , " Your descendents will take possession of the cities of their enemies . " That 's the second part of the blessing , a national blessing . And then thirdly , v. 18 , " and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed because you have obeyed me . " So these three parts of the covenant , the numerical , the national , and the spiritual ( " to all nations " ) are repeated in almost the exact same words to Isaac in Genesis 26:3 and 5 , to Jacob in Genesis 28:1314 , and numerous times and in various ways throughout the Pentateuch . <p> Its actually quite interesting that when Moses stands before the people in the opening chapter of Deuteronomy , that great passage , which occurs some 400 years after the original promise to Abraham , you nevertheless have this wonderful experience where Moses says to the people in vv. 1011 , when he looks out over the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Promised , he says in v. 10 : " The Lord has increased your numbers today so that you are as many as the stars in the sky . " So Moses acknowledges even before they go into the Promised Land that the first part of the Abrahamic promise has been fulfilled within Egypt itself . But Gods plan was never that the Israelites would simply be numerous and multiply exceedingly as slaves in Egypt . The 430 years of Egyptian slavery was soon to be passed by the next stage which actually calls them to take possession of the land . And so there is a long process , throughout the book of Joshua especially , where we find the Israelites taking possession of the land and fulfilling almost completely , but certainly significantly , the geographic portion of this , that they will take possession of the land that God promised to Abraham . <p> The problem , of course , is this third part of the blessing , the spiritual blessing to all nations . That becomes very , very difficult for them to sometimes gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their possession of the land . They eventually get exiled , and therefore it becomes extremely difficult for them to even think about the larger , global implications of their calling as the people of God . I do want to point out also that in the larger lectures we not only demonstrate how this promise is found in the Law , the Pentateuch , but also how its found in the Prophets and the Writings . We have tremendous promises found in Scripture . For example , in Psalm 2 , where we have the nations of the world to whom has been given this great promise that God wants to bless them , and instead we meet in Psalm 2 the nations raging and plotting against the LORD that is Yahweh and against His anointed one that is the Messiah , our Lord Jesus Christ . And in that wonderful passage in Psalm 2 , you have the Father promising the Son , not just that He would save Israel , but instead , a much broader agenda which is part of the mission of God . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth your possession " so this great promise that God will , in fact , bless the nations . This is done throughout the Old Testament in a number of ways . <p> This also appears not only in the strand of the Law and the Writings , but also in the Prophets themselves where you have a number of examples where you have the leadership of Israel recognized this tremendous hope that God was bringing them to and would carry them to through His abundant promises . For example , take the passage in Isaiah 49:6ff . This passage , which is quoted in the New Testament , is a tremendous insight into the great vision of God for the people of God . This , like Psalm 2 , is a conversation between the LORD and the Suffering Servant , the Messiah , who we of course now know is our Lord Jesus Christ . And this is what the LORD says to Jesus Christ . He says to Him , pathetically , " It is too small a thing for you to be my servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel I have kept . I will also make you a light to the Gentiles , that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth . " Now , this is an extremely important passage because here are the Israelites facing exile , facing the loss of even the second part of the Abrahamic covenant , and yet , the vision of Isaiah is not just that they would be restored to their land that would be the greatest prayer of any Israelite . " Oh , come back from exile . Be restored to the land . " But instead , the vision is always much , much greater . He says , " It is too small a thing if your prayer is only that I save the tribes of Israel and bring you back from exile . " He says , " The real vision is that I will make you a light for the Gentiles that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth . " What a great vision ! <p> And this , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apostle Paul , for example , when he talks about the missionary journey to the Gentiles , he quotes this passage and he says specifically , " This is what the Lord said commanding us " that is commanding the church " to take the message to all peoples on earth . " So the apostle Paul understands that this Messianic promise which is fulfilled in Christs coming is brought in application to the world through a very strong message and emphasis on the role of the church of Jesus Christ in the world . In the larger lectures we explain more carefully how this process happens . If you read Acts 13 we find that this is exactly the point that Paul makes . Paul says in reference to his turning to the Gentiles , in Acts 13:46 , " We had to speak the Word of God to you first . Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life , we now turn to the Gentiles . For this is what the Lord has commanded us . " Now , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what He commanded Christ " but " what He commanded us " that is , the church " I will make you " which we normally think of as a reference to Christ , the Messiah , but its actually here in the Greek , in the singular text which would make it refer to Christ , " I will make you " that is Christ , " a light to the Gentiles . " But Paul has said this is commanded to the Church . So , " I will make you a light to the Gentiles , that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth . " So this is a promise made about Christ , but it is brought to the world through the instrumentality of the obedient church who obeys the Great Commission and brings this great message out into all the earth . <p> So , in summary , the Old Testament has strong emphasis on Gods heart for the nations , not just Israel but all nations , found in the Law , the Prophets , and the Writings .

@@35723688 @4723688/ <p> As the title indicates , the historical period in the life of Israel extends from the cessation of Old Testament prophecy to the beginning of the Christian era . <p> I. The Period in General . <p> The Exile left its ineffaceable stamp on Judaism as well as on the Jews . Their return to the land of their fathers was marked by the last rays of the declining sun of prophecy . With Malachi it set . Modern historical criticism has projected some of the canonical books of the Bible far into this post-exilic period . Thus Kent ( HJP , 1899 ) , following the lead of the Wellhausen-Kuenen hypothesis , with all its later leaders , has charted the period between 600 BC , the date of the first captivity , to 160 BC , the beginning of the Hasmonean period of Jewish history , in comparative contemporaneous blocks of double decades . Following the path of Koster , the historical position of Ezra and Nehemiah is inverted , and the former is placed in the period 400-380 BC , contemporaneously with Artaxerxes II ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isa ( chapters 63-66 ; 24-27 ) are placed about 350 BC ; Zec is assigned to the period 260-240 , and Da is shot way down the line into the re ign of the Seleucids , between 200 and 160 BC . Now all this is very striking and no doubt very critical , but the ground of this historical readjustment is wholly subjective , and has the weight only of a hypothetical conjecture . Whatever may be our attitude to the critical hypothesis of the late origin of some of the Old Testament literally , it seems improbable that any portion of it could have reached far into the post-exilic period . The interval between the Old and the New Testaments is the dark period in the hist ory of Israel . It stretches itself out over about four centuries , during which there was neither prophet nor inspired writer in Israel . All we know of it we owe to Josephus , to some of the apocryphal books , and to scattered references in Greek and Latin historians . The seat of empire passed over from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Persian Empire collapsed , under the fierce attacks of the Macedonians , and the Greek Empire in turn gave way to the Roman rule . <p> II . A Glance at Contemporaneous History . <p> For the better understanding of this period in the history of Israel , it may be well to pause for a moment to glance at the wider field of the history of the world in the centuries under contemplation , for the words " fullness of time " deal with the all-embracing history of mankind , for whose salvation Christ appeared , and whose every movement led to its realization . <p> 1 . The Egyptian Empire : <p> In the four centuries preceding Christ , The Egyptian empire , the oldest and in many respects the most perfectly developed civilization of antiquity , was tottering to its ruins . The 29th or Mendesian Dynasty , made place , in 384 BC , for the 30th or Sebennitic Dynasty , which was swallowed up , half a century later , by the Persian Dynasty . The Macedonian or 32nd replaced this in 332 BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last or 33rd , the Ptolemaic Dynasty . The whole history of Egypt in this period was therefore one of endless and swiftly succeeding changes . In the Ptolemaic Dynasty there was a faint revival of the old glory of the past , but the star of empire had set for Egypt , and the mailed hand of Rome finally smote down a civilization whose beginnings are lost in the dim twilight of history . The Caesarian conquest of 47 BC was followed , 17 years later , by the annexation of Egypt to the new world-power , as a Roman province . Manetho 's history is the one great literary monument of Egyptian history in this period . Her priests had been famous for their wisdom , to which Lycurgus and Solon , the Greek legislators , had been attracted , as well as Pythagoras and Plato , the world 's greatest philosophers . <p> 2 . Greece : <p> In Greece also the old glory was passing away . Endless wars sapped the strength of the national life . The strength of Athens and Sparta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of our period , in 337 BC , the congress of Greek states had elected Philip of Macedon to the hegemony of united Greece , the knell of doom sounded for all Greek liberty . First Philip and after him Alexander wiped out the last remnants of this liberty , and Greece became a fighting machine for the conquest of the world in the meteoric career of Alexander the Great . But what a galaxy of illustrious names adorn the pages of Greek history , in this period , so dark for Israel ! Think of Aristophanes and Hippocrates , of Xenophon and Democritus , of Plato and Apelies , of Aeschines and Demosthenes , of Aristotle and Praxiteles and Archimedes , all figuring , amid the decay of Greek liberty , in the 4th and 3rd centuries before Christ ! Surely if the political glory of Greece had left its mark on the ages , its intellectual brilliancy is their pride . <p> 3 . Rome : <p> Rome meanwhile was strengthening herself , by interminable wars , for the great task of world-conquest that lay before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she trained her sons in the art of war , extended her territorial power and made her name dreaded everywhere . Italy and north Africa , Greece and Asia Minor and the northern barbarians were conquered in turn . Her intellectual brilliancy was developed only when the lust of conquest was sated after a fashion , but in the century immediately preceding the Christian era we find such names as Lucretius and Hortentius , Cato and Cicero , Sallust and Diodorus Siculus , Virgil and Horace . At the close of the period between the Testaments , Rome had become the mistress of the world and every road led to her capital . <p> 4 . Asia : <p> In Asia the Persian empire , heir to the civilization and traditions of the great Assyrian-Babylonian world-power , was fast collapsing and was ultimately utterly wiped out by the younger Greek empire and civilization . In far-away India the old ethnic religion of Brahma a century or more before the beginning of our period passed through the reformatory crisis inaugurated by Gatama Buddha or Sakya Mouni , and thus Buddhism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another reformer of the Tauistic faith was Confucius , the sage of China , a contemporary of Buddha , while Zoroaster in Persia laid the foundations of his dualistic world-view . In every sense and in every direction , the period between the Testaments was therefore one of political and intellectual ferment . <p> III . Historical Developments . <p> As regards Jewish history , the period between the Testaments may be divided as follows : <p> ( 1 ) the Persian period ; <p> ( 2 ) the Alexandrian period ; <p> ( 3 ) the Egyptian period ; <p> ( 4 ) the Syrian period ; <p> ( 5 ) the Maccabean period ; <p> ( 6 ) the Roman period . <p> 1 . The Persian Period : <p> The Persian period extends from the cessation of prophecy to 334 BC . It was in the main uneventful in the history of the Jews , a breathing spell between great national crises , and comparatively little is known of it . The land of Palestine was a portion of the Syrian satrapy , while the true government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the rule of the high priests , who were responsible to the satrap . As a matter of course , the high-priestly office became the object of all Jewish ambition and it aroused the darkest passions . Thus John , the son of Judas , son of Eliashib , through the lust of power , killed his brother Jesus , who was a favorite of Bagoses , a general of Artaxerxes in command of the district . The guilt of the fratricide was enhanced , because the crime was committed in the temple itself , and before the very altar . A storm of wrath , the only notable one of this period , thereupon swept over Judea . The Persians occupied Jerusalem , the temple was defiled , the city laid waste in part , a heavy fine was imposed on the people and a general persecution followed , which lasted for many years ( Ant. , XI , 7 ; Kent , HJP , 231 ) . Then as later on , in the many persecutions which followed , the Samaritans , ever pliable and willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scot free . <p> 2 . The Alexandrian Period : <p> The Alexandrian period was very brief , 334-323 BC . It simply covers the period of the Asiatic rule of Alexander the Great . In Greece things had been moving swiftly . The Spartan hegemony , which had been unbroken since the fall of Athens , was now by destroyed by the Thebans under Epaminondas , in the great battles of Leuctra and Mantinea . But the new power was soon crushed Philip of Macedon , who was thereupon chosen general leader by the unwilling Greeks . Persia was the object of Philip 's ambition and vengeance , but the dagger of Pausanias ( Ant. , XI , viii , 1 ) forestalled the execution of his plans . His son Alexander , a youth of 20 years , succeeded him , and thus the " great he-goat , " of which Daniel had spoken ( Da 8:8 ; 10:20 ) , appeared on the scene . In the twelve years of his reign ( 335-323 BC ) he revolutionized the world . Swift as an eagle he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved to Asia , where he defeated Darius in the memorable battles of Granicus and Issus . Passing southward , he conquered the Mediterranean coast and Egypt and then moved eastward again , for the complete subjugation of Asia , when he was struck down in the height of his power , at Babylon , in the 33rd year of his age . In the Syrian campaign he had come in contact with the Jews . Unwilling to leave any stronghold at his back , he reduced Tyre after a siege of several months , and advancing southward demanded the surrender of Jerusalem . But the Jews , taught by bitter experience , desired to remain loyal to Persia . As Alexander approached the city , Jaddua the high priest , with a train of priests in their official dress , went out to meet him , to supplicate mercy . A previous dream of this occurrence is said to have foreshadowed this event , and Alexander spared the city , sacrificed to Yahweh , had the prophecies of Daniel concerning him rehearsed in his hearing , and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5 ) From that day on they became his favorites ; he employed them in his army and gave them equal rights w ith the Greeks , as first citizens of Alexandria , and other cities , which he founded . Thus the strong Hellenistic spirit of the Jews was created , which marked so large a portion of the nation , in the subsequent periods of their history . <p> 3 . The Egyptian Period : <p> The Egyptian period ( 324-264 BC ) . The death of Alexander temporarily turned everything into chaos . The empire , welded Thrace together by his towering genius , fell apart under four of his generals--Ptolemy , Lysimachus , Cassander , and Selenus ( Da 8:21,22 ) . Egypt fell to the share of Ptolemy Soter and Judea was made part of it . At first Ptolemy was harsh in his treatment of the Jews , but later on he learned to respect them and became their patron as Alexander had been . Hecataeus of is at this time said to have studied the Jews , through information received from Hezekiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jewish history from the time of Abraham till his own day . This book , quoted by Josephus and Origen , is totally lost . Soter was succeeded by Ptolemy Philadelphus , an enlightened ruler , famous through the erection of the lighthouse of Pharos , and especially through the founding of the celebrated Alexandrian library . Like his father he was very friendly to the Jews , and in his reign the celebrated Greek translation of the Old Testament Scriptures , the Septuagint , was made , according to tradition ( Ant. , . XII , ii ) . As however the power of the Syrian princes , the Seleucids , grew , Palestine increasingly became the battle ground between them and the Ptolemies . In the decisive battle between Ptolemy Philopator and Antiochus the Great , at Raphia near Gaza , the latter was crushed and during Philopator 's reign Judea remained an Egyptian province . And yet this battle formed the turning-point of the history of the Jews in their relation to Egypt . For when Ptolemy , drunk with victory , came to Jerusalem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple , although he retreated , in confusion , from the holy place . But he wreaked his vengeance on the Jews , for opposing his plan , by a cruel persecution . He was succeeded by his son Ptolemy Epiphanes , a child of 5 years . The long-planned vengeance of Antiochus now took form in an invasion of Egypt . Coele-Syria and Judea were occupied by the Syrians and passed over into the possession of the Seleucids . <p> 4 . The Syrian Period : <p> The Syrian period ( 204-165 BC ) . Israel now entered into the valley of the shadow of death . This entire period was an almost uninterrupted martyrdom . Antiochus was succeeded by Seleucis Philopator . But harsh as was their attitude to the Jews , neither of these two was notorious for his cruelty to them . Their high priests , as in former periods , were still their nominal rulers . But the aspect of everything changed when Antiochus Epiphanes ( 175-164 BC ) came to the throne . He may fitly be called the Nero of Jewish history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Hellenists for the control of affairs . Onias III , a faithful high priest , was expelled from office through the machinations of his brother Jesus or Jason ( 2 Macc 4:7-10 ) . Onias went to Egypt , where at Heliopolis he built a temple and officiated as high priest . Meanwhile Jason in turn was turned out of the holy office by the bribes of still another brother , Menelaus , worse by far than Jason , a Jew-hater and an avowed defender of Greek life and morals . The wrangle between the brothers gave Antiochus the opportunity he craved to wreak his bitter hatred on the Jews , in the spoliation of Jerusalem , in the wanton and total defilement of the temple , and in a most horrible persecution of the Jews ( 1 Macc 1:16-28 ; 2 Macc 5:11-23 ; Da 11:28 ; Ant , XII , v , 3.4 ) . Thousands were slain , women and children were sold into captivity , the city wall was torn down , all sacrifices ceased , and in the temple on the altar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 Macc 1:43 ; 2 Macc 6:1-2 ) . Circumcision was forbidden , on pain of death , and all the people of Israel were to be forcibly paganized . As in the Persian persecution , the Samaritans again played into the hands of the Syrians and implicitly obeyed the will of the Seleucids . But the very rigor of the persecution caused it to fail of its purpose and Israel proved to be made of sterner stuff than Antiochus imagined . A priestly family dwelling at Modin , west of Jerusalem , named Hasmonean , after one of its ancestors , consisting of Mattathias and his five sons , raised the standard of revolt , which proved successful after a severe struggle . <p> The Maccabean period ( 165-63 BC ) . The slaying of an idolatrous Jew at the very altar was the signal of revolt . The land of Judea is specially adapted to guerilla tactics , and Judas Maccabeus , who succeeded his father , as leader of the Jewish patriots , Was a past master in this kind of warfare . All efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Syrian campaigns . The king died of a loathsome disease and peace was at last concluded with the Jews . Though still nominally under Syrian control , Judas became governor of Palestine . His first act was the purification and rededication of the temple , from which the Jews date their festival of purification ( see Purification ) . When the Syrians renewed the war , Judas applied for aid to the Romans , whose power began to be felt in Asia , but he died in battle before the promised aid could reach him ( Ant. , XII , xi , 2 ) . He was buried by his father 's side at Modin and was succeeded by his brother Jonathan . From that time the Maccabean history becomes one of endless cabals . Jonathan was acknowledged by the Syrians as meridarch of Judea , but was assassinated soon afterward . Simon succeeded him , and by the help of the Romans was made hereditary ruler of Palestine . He in turn was followed by John Hyrcanus . The people were torn by bitter partisan controversies and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two grandsons of John Hyrcanus , Hyrcanus and Aristobulus . In this internecine struggle the Roman general Pompey participated by siding with Hyrcanus , while Aristobulus defied Rome and defended Jerusalem . Pompey took the city , after a siege of three months , and entered the holy of holies , thereby forever estranging from Rome every loyal Jewish heart . <p> 6 . The Roman Period : <p> The Roman period ( 63-4 BC ) . Judea now became a Roman province . Hyrcanus , stripped of the hereditary royal power , retained only the high-priestly office . Rome exacted an annual tribute , and Aristobulus was sent as a captive to the capital . He contrived however to escape and renewed the unequal struggle , in which he was succeeded by his sons Alexander and Antigonus . In the war between Pompey and Caesar , Judea was temporarily forgotten , but after Caesar 's death , under the triumvirate of Octavius , Antony and Lepidus , Antony , the eastern triumvir , favored Herod the Great , whose intrigues secured for him at last the crown of Judea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judean princes . <p> IV . Internal Developments in This Period . <p> One thing remains , and that is a review of the developments within the bosom of Judaism itself in the period under consideration . It is self-evident that the core of the Jewish people , which remained loyal to the national traditions and to the national faith , must have been radically affected by the terrible cataclysms which mark their history , during the four centuries before Christ . What , if any , was the literary activity of the Jews in this period ? What was their spiritual condition ? What was the result of the manifest difference of opinion within the Jewish economy ? What preparation does this period afford for the " fullness of time " ? These and other questions present themselves , as we study this period of the history of the Jews . <p> 1 . Literary Activity : <p> The voice of prophecy was utterly hushed in this period , but the old literary instinct of the nation asserted itself ; it was part and parcel of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period many writings were produced , which of although they lack canonical authority , among Protestants at least , still are extremely helpful for a correct understanding the life of Israel in the dark ages before Christ . <p> ( a ) The Apocrypha . <p> First of all among the fruits of this literary activity stand the apocryphal books of the Old Testament . It is enough here to mention them . They are fourteen in number : 1 and 2 Esdras , Tobit , Judith , 2 Esther , Wisdom of Solomon , Ecclesiasticus , in Baruch , So of the Three Holy Children , History of Susannah , Bel and the Dragon , Prayer of Manasses , 1 and 2 Maccabees . As 3 and 4 Maccabees fall presumably within the Christian era , they are not here enumerated . All these apocryphal writings are of the utmost importance for a correct understanding of the Jewish problem in the day which they were written . For fuller information , see Apocrypha . <p> ( b ) Pseudepigrapha . <p> Thus named from the spurious character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very probably belong to our of period , while a host of them evidently belong to a later date . In this class of writings there is a mute confession of the conscious poverty of the day . First of all , we have the Psalter of Solomon , originally written in Hebrew and translated into Greek--a collection of songs for worship , touching in their spirit , and evincing the fact that true faith never died in the heart of the true believer . The second is the Book of Enoch , a production of an apocalyptic nature , named after Enoch the patriarch , and widely known about the beginning the Christian era . This book is quoted in the New Testament ( Jude 1:14 ) . It was originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic and translated into Greek as there is no trace of a Christian influence in the book , the presumption is that the greater part of it was written at an earlier period . Both Jude and the author of Revelation must have known it , as a comparative study of both books will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veritable crux interpretum : how to reconcile the inspiration of these books with these quotations ? <p> ( c ) The Septuagint . <p> The tradition of the Septuagint is told by Josephus ( Ant. , XII , ii , 13 ) . Aristeas and Aristobulus , a Jewish priest in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor ( 2 Macc 1:10 ) , are also quoted in support of it by Clement of Alexandria and by Eusebius . See Septuagint . The truth of the matter is most probably that this great translation of the Old Testament Scriptures was begun at the instance of Ptolemy Philadelphus 285-247 BC , under the direction of Demetrius Phalereus , and was completed somewhere about the middle of the 2nd century BC . Internal evidence abounds that the translation was made by different hands and at different times . If the translation was in any way literal , the text of the Septuagint raises various interesting questions in regard to the Hebrew text that was used in the translation , as compared with the one we now possess . The Septuagint was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to prepare the world for the " fullness of time . " <p> 2 . Spiritual Conditions : <p> The return from Babylon marked a turning point in the spiritual history of the Jews . From that time onward , the lust of idolatry , which had marked their whole previous history , utterly disappears . In the place of it came an almost intolerable spirit of exclusiveness , a striving after legal holiness , these two in combination forming the very heart and core of the later Pharisaism . The holy books , but especially the law , became an object of almost idolatrous reverence ; the spirit was utterly lost in the form . And as their own tongue , the classic Hebrew , gradually gave way to the common Aramaic , the rabbis and their schools strove ever more earnestly to keep the ancient tongue pure , worship and life each demanding a separate language . Thus , the Jews became in a sense bilingual , the Hebrew tongue being used in their synagogues , the Aramaic in their daily life , and later on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conqueror , the lingua franca of the period . A spiritual aristocracy very largely replaced the former rule of their princes and nobles . As the core of their religion died , the bark of the tree flourished . Thus , tithes were zealously paid by the believer ( compare Mt 23:23 ) , the Sabbath became a positive burden of sanctity , the simple laws of God were replaced by cumbersome human inventions , which in later times were to form the bulk of the Talmud , and which crushed down all spiritual liberty in the days of Christ ( Mt 11:28 ; 23:4,23 ) . The substitution of the names " Elohim " and " Adonai " for the old glorious historic name " Yahweh " is an eloquent commentary on all that has been said before and on the spiritual condition of Israel in this period ( Ewald , History of Israel , V , 198 ) , in which the change was inaugurated . The old centripetal force , the old ideal of centralization , gave way to an almost haughty indifference to the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nation without a country . For , for every Jew that came back to the old national home , a thousand remained in the land of their adopti on . And yet scattered far and wide , in all sorts of environments , they remained Jews , and the national consciousness was never extinguished . It was God 's mark on them now as then . And thus they became world-wide missionaries of the knowledge of the true God , of a gospel of hope for a world that was hopeless , a gospel which wholly against their own will directed the eyes of the world to the fullness of time and which prepared the fallow soil of human hearts for the rapid spread of Christianity when it ultimately appeared . <p> 3 . Parties : <p> During the Greek period the more conservative and zealous of the Jews were all the time confronted with a tendency of a very considerable portion of the people , especially the younger and wealthier set , to adopt the manners of life and thought and speech of their masters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bitterly hated by all true blooded Jews , but which left its mark on their history , till the date of the final dispersion 70 AD .

Thus the party of the Pharisees came into existence ( Ant. , XIII , x , 5 ; XVIII , i , 2 ; BJ , I , v , 2 ) . See Pharisees . They were opposed by the more secular-minded Sadducees ( Ant. , XIII , x , 6 ; XVIII , i , 3 ; BJ , II , viii , 14 ) , wealthy , of fine social standing , wholly free from the restraints of tradition , utterly oblivious of the future life and closely akin to the Greek Epicureans . See Sadducees . These parties bitterly opposed each other till the very end of the national existence of the Jews in Palestine , and incessantly fought for the mastery , through the high-priestly office . Common hatred for Christ , for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preparation for Christianity : <p> Throughout this entire dark period of Israel 's history , God was working out His own Divine plan with them . Their Scriptures were translated into Greek , after the conquest of Alexander the Great the common language in the East . Thus the world was prepared for the word of God , even as the latter in turn prepared the world for the reception of the gift of God , in the gospel of His Son . The Septuagint thus is a distinct forward movement in the fulfillment of the Abrahamic promise ( Ge 12:3 ; 18:18 ) . As the sacrificial part of Jewish worship declined , through their wide separation from the temple , the eyes of Israel were more firmly fixed on their Scriptures , read every Sabbath in their synagogues , and , as we have seen , these Scriptures , through the rendering of the Septuagint , had become the property of the entire world . Thus , the synagogue everywhere became the great missionary institute , imparting to the world Israel 's exalted Messianic hopes .

The eyes of Israel were blinded for a season , till the fullness of the Gentiles shall be gathered in ' ( Ro 9:32 ; 11:25 ) .

If not , we must pray even more , that God would give us the compassion and concern for those that are separated from the Good Shepherd . <p> Though it starts with prayer , it does not end there . Jesus is calling the disciples not only to pray but to be involved in sending as well . Though we pray for the Lord to do the sending , he uses us in the process .

Our purpose here will be the more modest one of attempting to set out the biblical teaching that forms the foundation of Christian theology . <p> Christian doctrine tells us what Christians believe about God .

The creation of mankind was quickly followed by the entry of evil into their heart .

But they made the wrong decision at the instigation of the tempter , and sin with all its dreadful consequences entered the world . <p> The central theme of Christian theology , that which gives it its Christian character , is the coming of Jesus into the world as its Savior from sin .

@@35723705 @4723705/ <h> Chapter V : The Names of God <p> When God gives names to persons or things , they are names which have meaning and give an insight into the nature of the persons or things designated . This also applies to the names which God has given Himself . Sometimes the Bible speaks of the name of God in the singular , and in such cases the term is a designation of the manifestation of God in general , especially in relation to His people , Ex. 20:7 ; Ps. 113:3 ; or simply stands for God Himself , Prov. 18:10 ; Isa. 50:10 . The one general name of God is split up into several special names , which are expressive of His many-sided being . These names are not of human invention , but are given by God Himself . <h> 1 . The Old Testament Names of God <p> Some of the Old Testament names denote that God is the High and Exalted One . ' El and ' Elohim indicate that He is strong and mighty and should therefore be feared , while ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the object of reverence and worship . Another name belonging to this class is ' Adonai , usually rendered " Lord , " the Possessor and Ruler of all men . Other names express the fact that God enters into relations of friendship with His creatures . One of these , common among the patriarchs , was the name Shaddai or ' El-Shaddai , which indeed stresses the divine greatness , but as a source of comfort and blessing for His people . It indicates that God controls the powers of nature , and makes them serve His purposes . The greatest name of God , however , always held sacred by the Jews , is the name Jehovah ( Yahweh ) . Its origin and meaning is indicated in Ex. 3:14 , 15 . It expresses the fact that God is always the same , and especially that He is unchangeable in His covenant relationship , and is always faithful in the fulfilment of His promises . It frequently assumes a fuller form in " Jehovah of Hosts . " This calls up the picture of Jehovah as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The New Testament Names of God <p> The New Testament names are simply the Greek forms of those found in the Old Testament . The following deserve particular attention : a . The name Theos . This is simply the word for ' God , ' and is the most common name employed in the New Testament . It is frequently found with a possessive genitive as ' my God , ' ' thy God , ' ' our God , ' ' your God . ' In Christ God is the God of each one of His children . The individual form takes the place of the national form , ' the God of Israel , ' so common in the Old Testament . <p> b . The name Kurios . This is the word for ' Lord , ' a name that is applied not only to God but also to Christ . It takes the place of both ' Adonai and Jehovah , though its meaning corresponds more particularly with that of ' Adonai . It designates God as the Possessor and Ruler of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The name Pater . It is often said that the New Testament introduced this as a new name . But this is hardly correct , for the name ' Father ' is also found in the Old Testament to express the special relation in which God stands to Israel , Deut. 32:6 ; Isa. 63:16 . In the New Testament it is more individual in that it points to God as the Father of all believers . Sometimes it designates God as the creator of all , I Cor. 8:6 ; Eph. 3:14 ; Heb. 12:9 ; Jas. 1:17 , and sometimes the first Person of the Trinity as the Father of Christ , John 14:11 ; 17:1 . <h> To memorize .

In this covenant between Yahweh and Israel , Moses served as mediator ; animals were sacrificed , the blood thus shed being also called " the blood of the covenant " ( dam haberith , Ex 24:8 ) . <h> Historical Connection <p> This brief book of laws occupies a fitting and dearly marked place in the Pentateuchal collection . Examination of the historical context shows that it is put where it belongs and belongs where it is put . A few months after the Exodus ( Ex 19:1 ) Israel arrived at Sinai . Immediately at the command which Moses had received from Yahweh in the Mount , they prepared themselves by a ceremonial of sanctification for entrance into covenant relation with Yahweh . When the great day arrived for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural phenomena went again to meet Yahweh in the top of the mountain . On his return ( Ex 19:25 ) , the words of the law , or the terms of the covenant , were declared to the people , and accepted by them . The first part of these covenant-terms , namely , the Decalogue ( Ex 20:2-17 ) , was spoken by the Divine voice , or its declaration was accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions ( Ex 20:18 ) . Therefore in response to the pleadings of the terrified people Moses went up again into the mountain and received from Yahweh for them the rest of the " words " and " ordinances " ( Ex 24:3 ) ; and these constitute the so-called Book of the Covenant ( Ex 20:22-23 ) . In this direct and unequivocal manner the narrator connected the book with the nation 's consecration at Sinai . The prophets regarded the making of the Sinaitic covenant as the marriage of Israel and Yahweh , and these laws were the terms mutually agreed upon in the marriage contract . <h> Analysis <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document into hard-and-fast divisions , the following analysis may be suggestive and serviceable : <p> directions concerning worship , specifying prohibition of images and the form of altar for animal sacrifices ( Ex 20:23-26 ) ; <p> ordinances for protection of Hebrew slaves , including betrothal , for a price , of daughter ( Ex 21:2-11 ) ; <p> laws concerning injuries , <p> to man by man ( Ex 21:12-27 ) , <p> to man by beast ( Ex 21:28-32 ) , <p> to beast by man ( Ex 21:33,14 ) , <p> to beast by beast ( Ex 21:35,36 ) ; <p> concerning theft ( Ex 22:1-4 ) ; <p> concerning damage to a neighbor 's property , including violence to his daughter ( Ex 22:5-17 ) ; <p> sundry laws against profaning Yahweh 's name , under which are included proper worship , avoidance of oppression and dutiful offering of first-fruits ( Ex 22:18-31 ) ; <p> against various forms of injustice and unbrotherliness ( Ex 23:1-9 ) ; <p> festal occasions , including the Sabbatical year and the three annual feasts : unleavened bread , first-fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain wrong practices in their sacrifices ( Ex 23:18,19 ) ; <p> in conclusion , a promise of God 's continual presence with them in the person of His Angel , and the consequent triumph over enemies ( Ex 23:20-33 ) . <h> Critical Theories <p> In this legislation are found two forms of laws or deliverances : <p> ( 1 ) the ordinances ( mishpaTim ) , which deal principally with civil and moral matters , are like court decisions , and are introduced by the hypothetical " if " ; <p> ( 2 ) words , or commands ( debharim ) , which relate chiefly to religious duties , being introduced by the imperative " thou shalt . " <p> The critical analysis and dismemberment of the books of Moses , if accepted , renders the simple historical explanation of the introduction to this body of laws untrue and impossible . The four chapters are assigned to JE , the Decalogue to E , and the Book of the Covenant to the Jahwist ( Jahwist ) or Elohim ( E ) , the repetition of the Decalogue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of the Covenant is held to be earlier than the Decalogue , and is indeed the oldest body of Hebrew legislation . However , it could not have been given at one time , nor in the wilderness , since the laws are given for those in agricultural life , and seem to be decisions made at various times and finally gathered together . Furthermore , this more primitive code either contradicts the later legislation of the Deuteronomist ( D ) and the Priestly Code ( P ) or reveals an entirely different point of view . The chief contradictions or divergences are : nature and number of altars , absence of an official priestly class , and simpler conception of the annual feasts as agricultural celebrations . Jahwist-Elohim ( JE ) came into united form in the 9th or 8th century , but this body of laws existed much earlier , embodying the earliest legal developments of Hebrew life in Canaan . It is suggested by some , as Driver , LOT , although he does not attempt the analysis , that this code is itself a composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAF-WELLHAUSEN HYPOTHESIS ) . <h> True , or Biblical Conception <p> But in favor of the simpler interpretation of these laws as the ethical obligations of the new bond between Yahweh and Israel some statements deserve to be made . If a solemn league and covenant was made at Sinai--and to this all the history , all the prophets and the Psalms give testimony--there must have been some statement of the germinal and fundamental elements of the nation 's moral relation to Yahweh . Such statement need not be final nor exhaustive , but rather intended to instruct and guide until later and more detailed directions might be given . This is exactly the position and claim of the Book of the Covenant ; and that this was the thought of the editor of the Pentateuch , and that this is the first and reasonable impression made by the unsuspecting and connected reading of the record , can hardly be questioned by candid minds . In answer to the criticism that the agricultural flavor of the laws presupposes settlement in Canaan--a criticism rather remarkable for its bland ignorance--it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt an agricultural section , and must have been able either to form or to receive a body of laws dealing with agricultural pursuits . <p> ( 2 ) They were on the march toward a land in which they should have permanent settlement in agricultural life ; and not the presence of allusions to such life , but rather their absence , should cause surprise . <p> ( 3 ) However , references to settled farm life are not so obtrusively frequent as those seeking signs would have us think . References to the animal life of the flock and herd of a shepherd people , such as the Israelites were at Sinai , are far more frequent ( Ex 21:28,33,15 ; 22:1,10 ; 23:4 , etc . ) . The laws are quite generic in form and conception , enforcing such duties as would devolve upon both temporary nomad and prospective tillers of the soil . R. B. Taylor therefore ( article in one-vol Hastings , Dictionary of the Bible ( five volumes ) ) accepts this code as originating in the desert wanderings . <p> In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and W. R. Smith in OTJC , that this code is in conflict with later legislation , it may be said that the Book of the Covenant , as an ethical and civil summary , is in its proper place in the narrative of the sojourn at Sinai , and does not preclude the expectancy of more elaborate organization of both ceremonial and civil order . But the whole question relates more properly to discussion of the later legislation or of the particular topics in dispute ( which see ) . For a thorough treatment of them consult W. H. Green , Hebrew Feasts . <h> Nature of the Laws <p> In the Book of the Covenant the moral elements strongly emphasized are : simplicity , directness and spirituality of worship ; a high and equitable standard of right ; highest consideration for the weak and the poor ; humane treatment of dumb animals ; purity in the relations of life ; the spirit of brotherhood ; and the simple and joyful life . Whatever development in details came with later legislation did not nullify the simple but lofty standards of the earlier laws .

Each lecture will be one hour long , with each covering a separate doctrine or series of doctrines together . <p> == Introduction to Evangelical Systematic Theology == <p> == I. What is Evangelical Systematic Theology ? == <p> First , let me give you a definition . It&amp;#39 ; s a rather long one , but you can consider it and then I will give some elaboration on this definition . It is a definition that I have written , but it comes from a variety of different sources , different theology texts and dictionaries . It goes as follows : <p> == A. Definition : == <p> Evangelical Systematic Theology is the comprehensive study and coherent organization of what can be known , primarily from Scripture , which is theology&amp;#39 ; s only final and ultimately authoritative source , and secondarily from any and all relevant sources , about God and His relation to the created universe , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end that God&amp;#39 ; s people are strengthened and satisfied in Him , to the praise and glory of His name . <p> == B. Elaboration on the Definition . == <p> Consider with me five different areas that are elaborations on this definition . <p> === 1 . The Subject-matter of EST. === <p> First of all , notice that the subject matter of Evangelical Systematic Theology , according to this definition , is God , God and His relation to the created universe . It is stated this way because theology , ' ' theos-logos ' ' , is , in essence , the study of God . It is a study of who God is , His own nature ; it is a study of God&amp;#39 ; s work , the creation that He has made ; it is a study of all that God is doing in accomplishing his purposes for creation , which includes human history . The study of every aspect of theology , whether it is the study of Christology , the Holy Spirit , man and his nature , sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really studies about God and his relation to the created universe . Theology is centrally about God and what God is doing through his purposes in creation . <p> === 2 . The Sources of EST. === <p> Secondly , what are the sources of Evangelical Systematic Theology ? Again , the definition says that theology comes primarily from Scripture , which is theology&amp;#39 ; s only final and ultimately authoritative source . Let me be clear that Scripture is not the only source for theology . Even the reformers , Calvin and Luther , who upheld ' ' sola scriptura ' ' , were also quite prone to look back to historical sources , make philosophical distinctions , and the like . Scripture was not the only source they looked at , but it was the only final , only ultimately authoritative source . This really distinguishes Evangelical Systematic Theology from other kinds of more liberal theologies that are present today and have been for several hundred years . With Evangelical Systematic Theology there is a commitment to Scripture and Scripture alone as the only final , ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source for theology . Any other source , whatever that may be , has to bow to the teaching of Scripture . We accept Scripture as the primary source for theology , but then there are secondary sources . These can come from the history of doctrines . For example , with biblical studies , archeology can be a helpful source . Philosophy can provide helpful ways of thinking about the distinction of concepts . The study of anthropology and sociology can be useful . But , all of these bow ultimately to the primary authority of Scripture and only supplement that authority . <p> === 3 . The Structure of EST. === <p> What about the structure of Evangelical Systematic Theology ? You can see , in the beginning of the definition , that Evangelical Systematic Theology is the comprehensive study and coherent organization of what can be known about God and his relation to the created universe . Theology is meant to be comprehensive in its scope of what we can know about God and his relation to the created universe . Of course , we never can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid missing anything that is relevant , attempts to avoid distorting different truths that are important to theology and then packages those , as it were , in a coherent fashion . It takes all that Scripture teaches , and whatever else we can learn from creation , say about God and his nature and character , and tries to organize those truths in ways that make sense , in ways that are understandable to us and in ways that are ordered . For example , in theology we talk about the doctrine of sin before we talk about the doctrine of salvation . There is an order to this . Obviously , salvation makes no sense if there is no sin . If no penalty , then why a rescue ? Why is God saving people if there is no need ? Theology works at presenting things in a coherent , ordered fashion . <p> === 4 . The Setting of EST. === <p> What about the setting of Evangelical Systematic Theology ? You will notice , toward the end of the definition , that it presents what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contemporary audiences . Both understandability , presenting it in a way that people can get it , and applicability , so people can understand its relation to life , what it means to how they live their lives , to what they should believe and how they should live , is part and parcel of what theology is about . There is a sense in which theology is contextual then . Every evangelical theologian who is doing his job correctly will seek to apply this theology in a way that is relevant for the particular setting to which it is addressed . ' ' Contextualized theology ' ' is really part and parcel to what Evangelical Systematic Theology is about . <p> === 5 . The Satisfaction of EST. === <p> Finally , what is the satisfaction of Evangelical Systematic Theology ? The definition ends with this , &amp;quot ; Theology is for the purpose or to the end that God&amp;#39 ; s people are strengthened and satisfied in Him to the praise and the glory of His name . &amp;quot ; This simply is a recognition that theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with knowledge about God or about His purposes or about His work . All of that is important , but the purpose of it is that , as we know these marvelous truths about God , we are strengthened ; we are satisfied in God ; we turn from other sources of satisfaction to Him and , by this , we give to Him the praise and the glory that is due His name . As John Piper so well puts it , &amp;quot ; God is most glorified in us as we are most satisfied in Him . &amp;quot ; This really is the goal of theology , to be satisfied in God , that we may give to Him our glory . <p> == II . Why study Evangelical Systematic Theology ? == <p> Let me suggest four things here for you quickly . <p> == A. Comprehensive Scriptural Vantage Point . == <p> Theology has the advantage of looking across the landscape , as it were , of all of the Bible&amp;#39 ; s teaching on various subjects , whereas biblical exegetes may focus in particular areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , God , or what John says about God , or what Revelation says about God . Exegetes focus on a particular passage and do careful work there , which , of course , is enormously valuable . Then what the theologian seeks to do is take the findings of biblical exegetes and biblical theology and put it together in a way that gives us a wholistic , comprehensive scriptural vantage point on various teachings of the Bible . Someone asks you , &amp;quot ; What does the Bible say about sin ? What does the Bible say about salvation ? What does the Bible say about the future ? &amp;quot ; Those are questions that are answered by systematic theologians that seek to give this broad , comprehensive , whole-Bible answer and do so in a manner that relates to their contemporary audiences . <p> == B. Interpretive Guide . == <p> Theology has the advantage of providing for us an interpretive guide . We can interpret the Bible knowing what we&amp;#39 ; re doing as we are doing this . For example , you are interpreting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I wonder if this passage should be interpreted this way or that ? &amp;quot ; You know from your theology that , if you take one of those interpretations , you&amp;#39 ; re really stepping outside the bounds of the theological convictions that you have previously formed , or at least have been informed of , and so you might reconsider this . On the other hand , you might reconsider your theology if you&amp;#39 ; re convinced the passage teaches that . But , what you do when you&amp;#39 ; re interpreting the Bible is endeavor to do so in a way that is consistent . All of Scripture is ultimately from one source ; we&amp;#39 ; ll talk about this in a little bit . Scripture is inspired by God , so we should not interpret one passage that contradicts how we interpret another passage . God doesn&amp;#39 ; t speak out of both sides of his mouth , so theology provides us a sort of warning . If we are interpreting a passage of Scripture that violates other teachings of Scripture , then we go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> == C. Religious Pluralism . == <p> Because of religious pluralism , it is so important for Christian people , probably more so now than ever , to know what they believe and why . We face a world now where there is anything but sympathy for Christian faith . Perhaps that was the case some years ago and Christians could be at ease in their own cultures , but this is not the rally case anywhere in the world any longer . There is a challenge being put forth to Christians to compromise what they believe in order to fit in better with the culture . We can see this happening within evangelicalism . There are compromises taking place on a variety of doctrines : on the doctrine of hell , on justification , on open theism , on inclusivism , a variety of areas where pluralism is forcing the issue of compromising on what we believe . Christian people need to know what the Bible teaches , that it , in fact , requires us to hold these particular truths and to do so with courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head , Heart , Hands , Habitat . == <p> I understand theology to function basically in this way : It first penetrates our heads . We think carefully about this and refine our understanding about what God has revealed to us in His Word , who He is , what His purposes are . But , God&amp;#39 ; s purpose is never for that knowledge to just reside in our heads , but rather to penetrate our hearts so that our very affections are moved and shaped and , as it were , remade because of those truths that become to us dear and precious . We not only need to know the truth , the head part of it , we need to love the truth . Truth that is not loved , I am convinced , will not be held by people long term . If , in fact , they hold to something that they really have deep reservations about , or they find something else much more attractive , their affections are drawn to something else . They will find reason , eventually , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see how liberalism often happens . It is a matter of heart-rejection of truth that leads the head to reject it . Of course , God&amp;#39 ; s idea is for this to work just the opposite way , namely , we accept the truth of His Word , that informs our heart , we embrace them , then , those truths become to us precious and dear , cherished beliefs . We love the Word . As that happens , then our hands are affected . The way we live flows out of what we value most deeply , what we have the strongest convictions about . Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks , so from our hearts , our mouths and our hands , our lives will be oriented . Of course , that will then effect the habitat in which we live , the environment , the people around us . As we live out the Christian faith , this will have an impact on the world around us . These , then , are at least four reasons , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Systematic Theology . I commend it to you . It is a marvelous tool for understanding God , His purposes , His work , and some of His most cherished truths from Scripture to us . <p> == DOCTRINES OF REVELATION AND SCRIPTURE == <p> == I. Revelation == <p> == A. The Concept of Revelation == <p> === 1 . Definition . === <p> If you look this word up in a dictionary , particularly a Bible or theology dictionary ; you will find that the term ' ' revelation ' ' can be understood to mean &amp;quot ; to reveal , &amp;quot ; &amp;quot ; to uncover , &amp;quot ; &amp;quot ; to lay bare , &amp;quot ; &amp;quot ; to disclose&amp;quot ; or &amp;quot ; to make known . &amp;quot ; The Hebrew term , ' ' galah ' ' , and the Greek term , ' ' apokalupto ' ' , both mean essentially the same thing , &amp;quot ; to uncover something that was covered&amp;quot ; or &amp;quot ; to lay bare something that was hidden . &amp;quot ; Revelation is the act of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , of course , God is there and the truth is there . It is not that truth comes to be by revelation , but rather , the truth of God is made known by revelation . Here is an analogy of revelation . If someone were to have a painting in the front of a room that they wanted to show to a group of people , there may , in fact , be a cloth covering the painting so no one can see it in advance . Then , at the right moment , with the spotlight on the painting that is covered , the person may say , &amp;quot ; Now I give to you this painting . &amp;quot ; He pulls away the cloth and you see the painting that was there before , but hidden . It was covered , but now it is laid bare . It is disclosed for what it is . That is revelation . God laying Himself bare before us . <p> === 2 . Scriptural Examples . === <p> Let me give you just a few scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;quot ; the heavens that declare the glory of God , &amp;quot ; is a good example of revelation in one of the aspects we will look at in a moment , in creation itself . Here God actually speaks forth in silent speech , the way I understand this passage ; He speaks forth His glory in the created order . &amp;quot ; The heavens are telling of the glory of God ; and their expanse is declaring the work of His hands . Day to day pours forth speech , and night to night reveals knowledge . &amp;quot ; Now verse 3 , as translated in the New American Standard Bible , says , &amp;quot ; There is no speech , nor are there words ; their voice is not heard . &amp;quot ; I think the point of this is that the actual revelation of God is speechless speech , is voiceless voice . It is so powerful , that it is as if people are screaming the glory of God but the heavens quietly present it . <p> Another example of the term ' ' revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the following , &amp;quot ; I praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants . &amp;quot ; There is our term , ' ' apokalupto ' ' . He has revealed them , uncovered them . &amp;quot ; Yes , Father , for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight . All things have been handed over to Me by My Father ; and no one knows the Son except the Father ; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him . &amp;quot ; There we have it again . It is clear that God has the prerogative , the right , when and what and to whom to reveal &amp;mdash ; what subject matter it is , when he is going to do this , and who will receive it . This is very clear . <p> Another example of this is in Matthew 16:17 , where Peter had just said in the previous verse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son of the living God . &amp;quot ; Here is how Jesus responded , &amp;quot ; Blessed are you , Simon Barjona , for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you , but my Father who is heaven . &amp;quot ; Now notice that Jesus does not say to Peter , &amp;quot ; Peter way to go ! You figured it out ! Wow ! You&amp;#39 ; re smart , Peter . &amp;quot ; Rather , Jesus makes clear that Simon Peter could not have known this on his own . The only way he could know and did know that Jesus was , in fact , the Christ , the Son of the living God , was as the Father revealed it to him . The Father , as it were , laid bare the truth about Jesus&amp;#39 ; identity and , apart from that , Peter could never have known . <p> == B. Forms of Revelation . == <p> Let&amp;#39 ; s look at two main forms of revelation that theologians have seen in Scripture and seem to be very clear from the Bible&amp;#39 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation . Let&amp;#39 ; s just take a minute on each one of these . <p> === 1 . General Revelation . === <p> Please understand that general revelation is general both in terms of its content , it gives general rather than very specific , very finely tuned truths about Jesus or about God or about his purposes in His work , but it is also general in terms of its scope , that is , it covers most people . So you might think of it this way , it is general in substance or content and general in scope or to whom it covers , all people who are able to be a part of the created order , all people who have a conscience have this revelation given to them . &lt;h4 class= " libheading " &gt; a . Avenues of General Revelation&lt;/h4&gt; What are the main avenues of general revelation ? They are creation and conscience . The two main passages that speak of each of these are in Romans 1 and Romans 2 , respectively . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; i . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of general revelation through creation spoken to us when Paul says , in verse 18 , &amp;quot ; For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness , because that which is known about God was evident within them ; for God made it evident to them . &amp;quot ; Of course , the question that ought to come to your mind when reading that is , how did God make this known to them ? He is talking about , perhaps , pagan people who have never been exposed to the teaching of the torah or to the Jewish religion . How is Paul so confident that this truth about God is evident to them ? they are without excuse . &amp;quot ; Here we see that this revelation of God in creation is clear enough that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , His divine nature . They can understand sufficiently that there is a God and what he is like , that they are held accountable for this revelation , and that they have seen and reject it . Now , we know that they rejected it because in verse 21 we read , &amp;quot ; For even though they knew God&amp;quot ; . How did they know God ? Somebody told them ? No , this is from the creation again , verse 20 , &amp;quot ; since the creation of the world&amp;quot ; . So &amp;quot ; even though they knew God , &amp;quot ; through creation , &amp;quot ; they did not honor him as God or give thanks , but they became futile in their speculations , and their foolish heart was darkened . &amp;quot ; Paul continues the list here of things that go wrong in terms of their understanding and embrace of this revelation . Clearly , through the created order , God makes himself known . The starry heavens above , the beautiful landscapes that we see as we travel are witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that He has done . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; ii . Conscience . &lt;/h5&gt; Another avenue of general revelation is conscience , the human moral sensibility , if you will , as we can see in Romans 2 . Paul says in Romans 2:14 , &amp;quot ; For when Gentiles , who do not have the Law , do instinctively the things of the Law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves , in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts , their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing , &amp;quot ; I take it that , when they do wrong their conscience tells them so , &amp;quot ; or else defending them . &amp;quot ; I also take it that , when they do right their conscience tells them this is the right thing to do and they do it . Paul says that on the basis of that they will be judged , &amp;quot ; on the day when , according to my gospel , God will judge the secrets of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made himself known in the created order , he has also made his moral law known in the hearts of people . Now granted , our hearts in that sense of the moral law can become callused . We can , in our sin , tread upon our consciences and make them very feeble instruments in helping us understand what is right and wrong , but that does not change the fact that we are given consciences before God that announce to us from our inner selves what is right and wrong . Paul even goes so far as to say that it is the very law of God , in verse 15 , &amp;quot ; they show the work of the Law&amp;quot ; . Of course he has in mind there the Law of Moses . So think , for example , the Ten Commandments , &amp;quot ; You shall not murder , you shall not steal , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not bear false witness . &amp;quot ; These are moral statutes , which are written on the hearts of people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his entitled , &lt;u&gt;The Abolition of Man&lt;/u&gt; devotes that book to this thesis that you can travel the world or you can look back in history and you find that there is , in the hearts of people , a uniform moral law . There is a sense in every culture that it is wrong to steal , wrong to commit adultery , wrong to murder . What constitutes stealing , what constitutes adultery , what constitutes murder can differ from one culture to another . But , the fact that it is wrong to steal , wrong to murder , wrong to commit adultery is true across cultures . Of course , the question must be raised , why is this the case ? Lewis argues that the only explanation that works is that God is a moral law giver and has provided for people this inward sense of right and wrong , &amp;quot ; the law written on their hearts&amp;quot ; . &lt;h4 class= " libheading " &gt; b . Efficacy of general revelation&lt;/h4&gt; Now what about the efficacy of general revelation ? By this I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobering answer to this , we can see it in Romans 1 , is that general revelation is sufficient to hold people guilty before God , but not sufficient to provide them saving revelation . There is nothing in Romans 1 or 2 that would give us reason to think that there is somehow saving revelation given through creation or through conscience . There is nothing about the work of Christ ; there is nothing about atonement for sin that is given in creation or in conscience . Rather , we are told about God sufficiently to know we are guilty before Him and realize we need help . This is the point . As Paul develops his thesis in Romans 1 , and following in chapters 2 , 3 , and 4 , it is clear that the solution to this problem is not saving revelation in creation , but saving revelation in the gospel , which is special revelation . The efficacy of general revelation then is this : it is sufficient to condemn but not sufficient to provide saving revelation ; for that we need special revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As general revelation was general in scope and in substance , likewise , special revelation is special or specific , if you will , both in scope and in substance . It is specific in scope , in that God&amp;#39 ; s special revelation is given just to some people at some times as He so chooses . Think of God&amp;#39 ; s appearance , for example , to Abraham . He gave this revelation just to Abraham . Think through the Bible . What about Moses and the burning bush ? This was special revelation just to Moses . He told Moses , &amp;quot ; Go back and tell the people what I have said . &amp;quot ; Moses becomes the one who tells them what it is ; God does not tell them directly . Through the rest of the Bible you can see special revelation being these specific revelatory acts where God makes himself known to specific people . <p> It is special or specific in scope but also in substance ; it is far more fine-tuned . We learn specific things about God and His purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways ; specific purposes , specific goals , specific actions of God through special revelation that we could not know just by looking at the created order or by examining our consciences . Special revelation then is the specific revelation of God to specific people and of specific content or substance . &lt;h4 class= " libheading " &gt; a . Avenues of Special Revelation&lt;/h4&gt; What are the main avenues of special revelation ? I have four listed here . Perhaps there could be others that would be added to this , but I think these are a helpful listing . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; i . Personal encounter . &lt;/h5&gt; Think , for example , of Abraham or Moses , that I mentioned a moment ago , where God actually came to them and spoke with them in an encounter and gave them specific commandments and warnings and promises . This is a revelation of personal encounter that God is free to do when He wishes but is not obligated to do . Clearly , when God has chosen to do this He has done so with various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think , for example , of Saul&amp;#39 ; s conversion . Saul became Paul the Apostle when Christ revealed himself to Saul as he was on the road to Damascus about to persecute Christians . This is a personal encounter . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; ii . Mighty act . &lt;/h5&gt; The revelation of God through mighty act is His revelation in miraculous and astonishing actions that take place , deeds that he performs . Think , for example , of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone from heaven . This is a revelation of God in mighty act . No word needs to be spoken to understand what is going on here . God is angry and he is bringing his judgment against the sin of this culture and it is shown in such forcefulness . Think of the Red Sea crossing and how God saves his people by parting the waters of the Red Sea . They walk across on dry ground and after they are across then the armies of Egypt come after them pursuing them . What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian soldiers and kills all of them in the Red Sea . This is mighty act revelation where God demonstrates his power and his purposes in the actions he performs in miracles . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; iii . Propositional revelation . &lt;/h5&gt; This is a term that can be easily misunderstood . Proposition here does not mean simply propositional statements as apposed to poetic or metaphorical or symbolic statements . The word propositional is being used here in the sense of using of human language as the conveyance of this revelation . God revealed ; His purposes , His promises , His commands revealed in human language is propositional revelation . Of course , propositional revelation includes the Bible . All of the Bible , because it is inspired by God ( we will come to this in just a few moments ) , is , in fact , propositional revelation , but it would not be right to say that all of propositional revelation is the Bible . Can you see why that is ? Obviously , God has spoken more , said more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so all of Scripture is propositional revelation , but also God spoke to prophets and apostles . Jesus , when he was here , spoke many more things we know than what is recorded for us in the four gospels and all of that was propositional revelation . The revelation of God through human language is much more extensive than the Bible , but God has left for us all that is sufficient , all that is needful for us in the Bible , which is propositional revelation . &lt;h5 class= " libheading " &gt; iv . Incarnation . &lt;/h5&gt; It really deserves a separate place as an avenue of special revelation because here we have all of the above forms coming together . Incarnation is certainly a personal encounter of God in human flesh . As John says in John 1:14 , &amp;quot ; We beheld His glory , glory as of the only begotten Son of the Father , full of grace and truth . &amp;quot ; This was God manifest in the person of Christ . And , of course , it is mighty act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lame . He performed miracles among them , turned water into wine , walked on the water , raised people from the dead and , by these various mighty acts that He performed , demonstrated the truth of His words that He was , in fact , the Son of God . Of course , in Jesus own ministry there was much propositional revelation . He taught the disciples in so many , many ways , truths that came in the form of discourses and parables , teaching them by using human language . In the incarnation you have the epitome of the revelation of God to His people . It says in Hebrews 1 that , although God spoke in the past in a variety of different portions and ways , &amp;quot ; in these last days , &amp;quot ; he says in verse He made the world . &amp;quot ; Jesus is , in a very special sense , the ultimate revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation to us. &lt;h4 class= " libheading " &gt; b . Efficacy of Special Revelation&lt;/h4&gt; What is the efficacy of special revelation ? I think you can put it this way . Special revelation , when it comes to people , provides them either greater basis for guilt , if they reject it , or the promise of life and hope , if they accept it . I think that is the easiest way to think of it , because when special revelation comes , remember to whom much is given much will be required . Why is it that the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida in Matthew 11 were held more accountable according to Jesus than Sodom and Gomorrah ? Remember Jesus said to them , &amp;quot ; Woe to you Chorazin and Bethsaida ! If the miracles performed among you had been performed in Sodom and Gomorrah they would have repented in dust cloth and ashes . It will be more tolerable for them on the day of judgment than it will be for you . &amp;quot ; Now why would that be ? Because greater revelation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh , the Son of God in the flesh , performing miracles and teaching , providing this revelation . So , when that revelation is rejected by the Pharisees and the teachers of the law , this results in greater incurring of judgment upon them . <p> On the other hand , special revelation , when accepted , provides greater and greater basis for hope and life and joy . This is why becoming a Christian is just the beginning . When one&amp;#39 ; s eyes are opened to see the truth , more and more truth can be understood and embraced so that greater freedom , greater joy , greater blessing , greater experience of what God has for us can come through the effect of special revelation on our minds and hearts . Efficacy of special revelation either brings greater judgment or greater blessing depending upon its refusal and rejection or its acceptance and embrace . <p> == II . Inspiration of Scripture == <p> == A. Definition of Inspiration == <p> === 1 . General Meaning . === <p> The term inspiration , in English , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very colloquial senses . We might talk about Mozart , who was an inspired musician , or we might talk about Shakespeare as an inspired writer . Of course , we mean that these people had exceptional gifting , remarkable ability in their various fields . We use inspiration in that kind of common colloquial sense . But , as it is used in the Bible in 2 Timothy 3:16 , clearly it has more of a sense of expiration , that is , it is aspirated out from God . The Scriptures , then , according to the proper definition of inspiration , are the out-breathing of God&amp;#39 ; s breath that results in the writing of the Scriptures as they were originally given by the apostles and prophets . The Scriptures were written by human beings ; every one of the books of the Bible was written by a human being . ( Some have more than one person involved in the writing . ) Nonetheless , behind all of the sixty-six books of the Bible there is the one divine author , God , who breathes forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the fact that all Scripture is God-breathed . It is , in fact , the product of God&amp;#39 ; s out-breathing or God&amp;#39 ; s breath . Actually , a better word for us would be expiration , but that has a problem doesn&amp;#39 ; t it ? If we talk about the expiration of Scripture , we use that term in other ways that would not have the right connotation to it . I think that we are stuck with the term inspiration , although , we have to realize it means something qualitatively different than when we use it of Shakespeare or of Mozart or another . <p> === 2 . Verbal , Plenary Inspiration . === <p> We should also understand that evangelicals have affirmed the verbal , plenary inspiration of the Bible . By verbal , first of all , they mean that the very language of the Bible is the result of God&amp;#39 ; s out-breathing . That is , the very grammar , syntax , words that are used , every component of the language of the original writings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God&amp;#39 ; s out-breathing . That is why , in conservative , evangelical seminaries , there is more attention paid to learning the original languages , Greek and Hebrew . Have you wondered why the students at conservative schools are put through the grueling task of learning , as well as they can , these biblical languages ? The answer is very simple ; we believe in verbal inspiration . We believe that the very language of the Bible , as it was written in Greek and Hebrew , represents what God wanted communicated . We want to pay attention to whether this is a perfect or an aorist or a present tense . We want to be careful that we understand the syntax of the passage . We want to be careful to analyze the specific words that are used in the original and not be dependent just on a translation that will provide an English or another language translation of those terms . Verbal inspiration , then , refers to the very language of the Bible and all of its parts , its grammar , its syntax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of God&amp;#39 ; s out-breathing . <p> Plenary inspiration refers to the fact that all of the Bible , in all of its parts , is this way . Plenary is a term referring to all of it together ; all of the Bible , in all of its parts , is the result of God&amp;#39 ; s out-breathing . What we can not do is go through the Bible and pick those parts of the Bible which are inspired and those parts that are not . Rather , all of the Bible , in all of its parts , is inspired by God , is the result of his out-breathing . This is the view that evangelicals have held . Some , I should just tell you , are giving this doctrine of verbal , plenary inspiration up these days . I challenge you to think through the implications of this if , in fact , either one of these , the verbal inspiration of Scripture or the plenary inspiration of Scripture is abandoned . Where does that leave us in terms of an authoritative Bible for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Teachings . == <p> I want to look with you here at three primary texts for the doctrine of inspiration . <p> === 1 . 2 Timothy 3:16-17. === <p> Paul writes to Timothy , &amp;quot ; All Scripture is inspired by God . &amp;quot ; There is our term , ' ' qeovpneusto&amp;curren ; ' ' , in Greek . &amp;quot ; All Scripture is ' ' ( qeovpneusto&amp;curren ; ) ' ' inspired by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness ; so that the man of God may be adequate , equipped for every good work . &amp;quot ; Here are a few comments on this . Notice that &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; Scripture is this way . Here we have this sense of plenary inspiration , don&amp;#39 ; t we ? All Scripture is God-breathed . We do not go through the Bible and pick out parts that are inspired and scrap the parts that aren&amp;#39 ; t . No , we don&amp;#39 ; t have that luxury if we believe the Bible is what it is , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . <p> Notice the second point &amp;mdash ; that inspiration precedes , in this verse , profitable . What Scripture is &amp;mdash ; inspired by God &amp;mdash ; is the basis for what it can do , namely , it is profitable for teaching for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness . Now I think this is such an important thing to realize &amp;mdash ; that what something does is dependent upon what it is . Let&amp;#39 ; s look at an example of this . If you had a race car that you wanted to win the Indianapolis 500 race , you would not take out several of the spark plugs , put it on the racetrack and expect it to run . It can not do what you want it to do if it is not in the right condition to do it . You have to have , if it is going to win the race , a racecar that is in optimal condition . Now think how this applies to the Bible . If the Scripture is not entirely inspired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible is not inspired by God , how can that part be profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness ? The fact of the matter is , people who have rejected inerrancy also reject part of the Bible as exactly not profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction . We understand that the only way all of the Bible can be profitable for us is if all of the Bible is , in fact , inspired by God . <p> The third point I want you to see is that Paul&amp;#39 ; s main reason for talking about Scripture here is not to talk about Scripture , per se , but to talk about its effect upon us . He says , at the end of verse 16 and 17 that , &amp;quot ; Scripture is profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness that the man of God may be adequate , equipped for every good work . &amp;quot ; I believe with all of my heart that if Christian people truly believed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote far more time to reading , meditating upon and reflecting deeply upon the teaching of Scripture . Look at what Paul says . Do you want to be a person who is adequate , equipped for every good work ? How is this going to happen ? Scripture is profitable to do this . May God give us hearts not only to embrace a strong orthodox , evangelical doctrine of Scripture ( yes , verbal , plenary inspiration is essential ) , but also to embrace the necessity of devoting ourselves to Scripture in order to become the kind of people God calls us to be . <p> === 2. 2 Peter 1:20-21. === <p> The apostle Peter describes Scripture in this way at the end of this chapter , &amp;quot ; Know this first of all , that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&amp;#39 Spirit spoke from God . &amp;quot ; Now here , I think Peter is making a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Timothy 3 . While Scripture is , in fact , from God , 2 Timothy 3:16 , &amp;quot ; All Scripture is inspired by God , &amp;quot ; it is also the result of human origin . Human beings write Scripture . As he says , &amp;quot ; men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke . &amp;quot ; Scripture did not , as it were , originate ultimately from human beings ; they did not make this up , they did not think this up ; they did not come up with it on their own . Still , they wrote out of their own hearts ; they wrote from their own convictions and beliefs . When you read the gospel writers , you are reading what they believed was true about Jesus and His teaching and His works . Read what the apostle Paul is saying to the Galatians , for example , in Galatians 4:19 , &amp;quot ; I am as a woman in labor until Christ is formed in you&amp;quot ; . Wow ! What an amazing , powerful metaphor that Paul , as a pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is using . This is coming out of Paul&amp;#39 ; s heart . This is not by dictation . The amazing thing is that Scripture , yes , is 100 percent divine , but it also is 100 percent human . It is the result of men who were moved by the Holy Spirit , who speak from God , so both are true in our doctrine of Scripture . Some have likened the Living Word to the written Word on this score . The Living Word , Jesus , was 100 percent God and 100 percent human , two natures in one person . The Bible , the written Word , is 100 percent divine and 100 percent human . It is ultimately from God . The author of the entire Bible is God . That is why we call it the Word of God because believe that this is the case . But , it is also the word of Moses , the word of Isaiah , the word of Ezekiel , the word of John , the word of Paul , and the word of Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believed from their hearts , but they did so as they were moved by the Holy Spirit . <p> === 3. 1 Corinthians 2:13. === <p> This is a very interesting passage , because it really culminates Paul&amp;#39 ; s teaching about the revelation that God had given . In verse 13 he shifts to inspiration . In order to see this , back up with me for a moment and look with me at verse 10 . Here we see revelation is being spoken of , &amp;quot ; For to us God revealed them . &amp;quot ; Now , what did he reveal ? Verse 9 , &amp;quot ; Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard , and which have not entered the heart of man . &amp;quot ; &amp;quot ; These things that God had not made known before , &amp;quot ; verse 8 , that the rulers of this world had not understood . Now verse 10 , &amp;quot ; To us God revealed them through the Spirit . &amp;quot ; Revelation comes through the Spirit . Verse 11 , &amp;quot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the spirit of the man that is in him ? Even so the thoughts of , but the Spirit who was from God , so that we might know the things freely given to us by God . &amp;quot ; In other words , the Spirit of God brought to Paul revelation . Who knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God ? No one does . The Spirit brought to Paul these words of revelation . <p> Now , in verse 13 , it shifts to inspiration . &amp;quot ; Which things , &amp;quot ; that is , which truths , &amp;quot ; we also speak , not in words taught by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , combining spiritual with spiritual . &amp;quot ; The New American Standard adds in here &amp;quot ; spiritual thoughts with spiritual words , &amp;quot ; which probably is correct . Paul is saying that God not only gave us the concepts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit also gives us the very words by which to articulate them . The revelation given to us is by the Spirit , and that revelation expressed to others in words taught by the Spirit , is also Spirit-derived . Inspiration , then , is the work of the Spirit in the heart of a biblical writer to say what he believes but to do so with the Spirit , or God more generally , at work in him to prompt him what to say . <p> One more comment on this and then we will move to the last area of inerrancy . It does seem to me that the doctrine of inspiration can only rightly be accounted for if one holds a view of the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom that is called ' ' compatibilism ' ' . Compatibilism means that God accomplishes what He wants and we do what we want and the two mix together . In inspiration it is clear that God is the author of the entire Bible and yet this did not happen by dictation . It happened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that what they wrote was what He wanted written ; what they wrote was , in fact , the word of both Paul and God ; so you have compatibilism . What Paul wanted to write , what God wanted Paul to write are the same thing . Human free will is not violated by the work of God within a heart to prompt it and move it to do what God , in fact , seeks it to do . We will talk more about that notion of compatibilism when we get into the areas of the attributes of God , and particularly the sovereignty of God . <p> == III . Inerrancy of Scripture == <p> == A. The Debate of Recent Years : What is at Issue ? == <p> Essentially , a number of years ago , say 25 years or so , questions began to arise within evangelicalism as to whether or not the historicity and the facticity , the factual nature , of all of the Bible was , in fact , true . Some evangelicals began raising questions as to whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible , as it is meant , as true . People would raise questions about , for example , trying to harmonize the Easter accounts , because it looks as though one gospel writer may say that a cock crowed a certain number of times and another says something different . Or , a question was raised about whether the mustard seed is the smallest seed as Jesus said , and was Jesus correct about that . <p> There began to arise within evangelicalism a dispute over the nature of the Bible . People who sided with the errancy group , who said we really have to discard the notion of inerrancy , were people who said , &amp;quot ; The Bible is a human product . Now , granted , God gets His Word across ; the big picture gets communicated even though there are lots of little errors that happen in the Bible . We have to look out for those errors and just recognize that we can&amp;#39 ; t accept those , while we do accept the main message of the Bible . &amp;quot ; But others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Bible is , in fact , inspired by God , if it really is ultimately His Word , God does not lie . He does not misrepresent the truth and so God must work through the writers of Scripture to present the truth . &amp;quot ; Now , that does not mean that they can&amp;#39 ; t present things with round numbers , e.g. 5,000 died in battle . Do you mean that it wasn&amp;#39 ; t 5,001 or 4,999 ? It is a round number and we ought to understand that . If someone asked you after church Sunday how many were there , you might say 350 . Is that an accurate statement ? It is if you understand that it is meant to be a round number . Or phenomenological statements , &amp;quot ; the sky above and Hades beneath , &amp;quot ; these are phenomenological ways of thinking with the grave below you and clouds above you . <p> == B. Defining Inerrancy. == <p> In essence , what happened was that people who held to inerrancy then defined inerrancy in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which biblical authors were attempting to speak . We took their teachings in ways that were consistent with what they sought to teach . Ultimately , the definition given for inerrancy by people such as those of us at Southern Seminary and those at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and the Evangelical Theological Society says that &amp;quot ; All that the Scripture teaches or intends to present as truth is true . &amp;quot ; <p> == C. Authority and Inerrancy. == <p> It is very simple , it seems to me , to realize that if inerrancy is given up , if in fact the entire Bible is not true , then the authority of Scripture is compromised . After all , we don&amp;#39 ; t know , when we are reading the Bible , where the problems are . The Bible does not come with an errata page that tells you where the mistakes can be found on page such and such . No , it is up to us to try to find those . That is why people can discard things , like Paul Jewett did at Fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have Paul , the Pharisee , who says that wives should submit to their husbands and women should not teach or exercise authority over men . Paul , the Pharisee , that said that and , of course , that is not really true , so we discard that . The question then becomes , where do we draw the line on what we discard ? Who is to say what is true and what isn&amp;#39 ; t in the Bible ? So ultimately , the authority resides with us and not with the Bible . The inspiration of Scripture demands the inerrancy of Scripture and only an inspired inerrant Bible is fully authoritative for our lives , our faith , and our practice .

@@35723800 @4723800/ <h> Passion and Resurrection - Part 1 <h> I. Passion Narrative <p> At last we come to the Passion narrative in the four Gospels , describing the last day or night and day of Jesus ' earthly life . There are numerous historical problems surrounding the accounts of Jesus ' arrest and trials and execution which are discussed in the textbook . But all of them , essentially , come down to two issues , namely : all the later rabbinical laws were alleged to have been broken , already in force in these pre seventy ( refers to AD 70 when Rome sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple ) days and secondly were these laws followed . Desperate men even in high positions of power often do not follow their own laws in times of crisis . More important for the Gospel writers , clearly , was the theological message of the crucifixion narratives , although distributed among the various Gospel writers , the sudden sayings recorded of Jesus from the Cross , often referred to as the Sudden Last Words of Christ . ' Clearly when put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Christians understood to be attached to these events . Thus Jesus in excruciating pain can nevertheless look upon the enemies who had condemned him to this agonizing execution , pleaded for his heavenly Father to forgive them ; for they knew not what they were doing . ' He can grant similar pardons such as the repentant thief on one side of him who begs Jesus to remember him when he enters into his Kingdom . Jesus replied , today , you shall be with me in paradise . ' <p> He showed concern for his earthly mother and directs the disciple who he was apparently closest to , traditionally associated with the Apostle John to look after her . Joseph may well have passed away by this time and Jesus ' biological half brothers and sisters had not come to faith in him so it makes sense that he entrusts Mary to John and vice versa with the words , mother behold you son , son behold you mother . ' In what must certainly rank as one of the most theological statements in Scripture because we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine God/man with his heavenly father . It is that point that later Christian reflection would understand to be when he took upon himself all the sins of the world and therefore had to be separated for a time from his heavenly Father that he cried out , my God , my God ? Why have you forsaken me ? ' <p> Then the subsequent sayings , I thirst and it is finished apply at the physical level by a clearly and more profound deeply spiritual level and then in an amazing trusting of the very God whose presence he had been separated from , prays a simply trusting prayer of a child at bed time as he gives up his spirit in death , Father , into your hands , I commit my spirit . ' It 's also significant to pay attention to the theological distinctives of each of the four Gospel writers . Here , if ever , one can go to the table of contents/index in the back of synoptics and simply look for entire kerygapis that are in boldface with boldface parallels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first and shortest Gospel , one is forced there more simply to focus on what is essential to Mark 's narrative . Namely , the apocalyptic side that accompanies Jesus ' death , the earthquake that tore the Temple into , the centurions confession , that surely that this was the Son of God , which from his Greco-Roman viewpoint may have simply meant a deified man but for a Gospel like Mark who begins with the headline , This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God . ' He uses this title not frequently but at crucial junctures to punctuate his narrative . It clearly reflects an even deeper truth of the identity of Jesus . Mark also narrates in detail the various trials before the Sanhedrin and the Jewish leadership , alongside Pontus Pilate representing the Roman leadership . From a theological perspective , however , it is every single individual 's sins that crucified Jesus . So the Passion narrative can scarcely be used to supply anti-Semitism or anti-Romanism or prejudice against any single ethnic group . <p> Matthew 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the events surrounding his death fulfilled the Old Testament . The constant preoccupation of Matthew , the heighten sense of the responsibility of the Jewish crowd who when Pontus Pilate was trying to avoid crucifying Jesus , accepted responsibility for his death by shouting ( Matthew 27:25 ) , his blood be upon us and our children . In context , an idiomatic way of saying , we take responsibility for this , not a self-condemnation for the entire race for all time . So if Matthew sees a deeper meaning here , maybe it was upon their children , one generation later , the judgment attributed to God of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem . And the instruction of much of Jerusalem and its inhabitants by Rome was accomplished . At the same time , the very death , they assigned Christ to , made possible their eternal life for all who would repent and turn to him . It is also uniquely Matthew who refers to the request for a guarded tomb for fear that his disciples would come and steal his body and announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that event will occur in Matthew distinctive edition to the resurrection narrative on which we will comment more at that time . <p> Luke has the unique emphasis on Jesus ' innocence by adding the extra hearing before Herod Antipas in between his hearing of Pontus Pilate ; all of them find nothing legally worthy of condemnation . The centurion 's testimony is radically rewritten to read , truly this man was innocent . ' And where there is no indication of one of the criminals on the cross on either side of Jesus subsequently repenting , it is Luke who uniquely includes that exchange with our Lord . <p> Finally , in John 's Gospel , we have the emphasis on his true humanity against the emerging Gnosticism , and of Pilate rendering of , behold the man , ' and with the soldier 's spear thrust proving his true death with the outflow of blood and water from the pericardial sack around the heart which only takes place within a few hours of physical death . At the same time , Jesus ' divinity has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet prepared to accept this aspect of Jesus ' nature . It is only John who has the scene in which those who would arrest Jesus in the Gardens fall backwards as if bumping up against an invisible force field when Jesus says , I am he , ' in reply to the question , Whom do you seek ? ' with the answer , Jesus of Nazareth . ' Making it clear that Jesus goes to his death voluntarily as also does the uniquely lengthy exchange with Pilate in the 4th Gospel in which Jesus insists that he would have no power over him were it not given to him from above . <h> II . Resurrection ! <p> Fortunately , for the human race , the agony and defeat of the Cross gives way on what today we call Eastern Sunday Morning to the glorious drama of the resurrection . Again , there are historical questions , some of which allege that the many different appearances and details involved in the four Gospels are contradictory . We refer in the text to sources that in fact give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide here , simply sketches a brief outline of the most important points of such harmonization . On Sunday morning the women , a group of several who had watched Jesus die , go to further anoint his body in the tomb , unsure how they will manage to get into the sealed tomb , perhaps , hoping that the Roman Soldiers will allow them this typical Jewish custom of honor and mourning . Mary runs ahead while it is still dark , reports back to the women that all see the tomb , apparently together . Mary also goes on to tell the disciples but returns on her own later to have her own personal encounter with Jesus as described in John 20 . Later on , Jesus appeared to Cleopas and one other on the road to Emmaus , in the final chapter of Luke 's Gospel . Jesus taught them , beginning with Moses and all the Prophets , he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself . Peter also met with Jesus that Sunday evening with Thomas being absent , Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have remained in Jerusalem for the rest of the week long Passover feast and a week later , again , at the end of the festival , this time with Thomas present , Jesus appears and Thomas likewise comes to believe that he has indeed resurrected . <p> Over the coming weeks leading up to the ascension , approximately forty days later , Jesus appears to seven disciples ( John 21 ) and then to the eleven by the Sea of Galilee as well and on the Mount of the Beatitudes as shown in John 21 and Matthew 28 and then in 1st Corinthians 15 , it tells us that he appeared to over five hundred of his followers . Probably during the period of his Galilean appearances , this corresponded to the location of the largest group of members of Jesus ' followers outside the twelve apostles . The ascension takes place on the Mount of Olives as the disciples headed back to the vicinity of Jerusalem in preparation for the festival of Pentecost and a brief reference to waiting for good spiritual things to happen in Acts brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved the credibility of such a supernatural narrative . The five points shown in the continued slide of the resurrection adds historical support which forms powerful evidence for such credibility . In a world in which women 's testimony was rarely admissible in a court of law , it seemed highly improbable that four authors writing independently of each other would all concoct a story where women were the first and primary witnesses to the empty tomb and to the resurrected Jesus . The significance of death with crucifixion from Deuteronomy 21:23 , His body shall not remain all night on the tree , but you shall in any wise bury him that day ; ( for he that is hanged is cursed of God ) that your land be not defiled , which the Lord you God gives you for an inheritance . This was already interpreted by the Jewish leaders that anyone executed who was deemed to be both a criminal and cursed by God . How did the originally exclusively Jewish band of Jesus ' followers overcome this seemingly theological obstacle in order to claim Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one worthy of worship ? This was something that was very dramatic and affected them all . <p> Thirdly , what about the early shift already discernable in the book of Acts , the gathering of Christians in Acts 20 , in 1st Corinthians where the offering is taken on the Lord 's day , on the first day of the week . In 1st Corinthians 16 , again , what was originally the Jewish band of disciples came to worship and honor the resurrected Jesus , not on their traditional day of worship , the Sabbath , the 7th day of the week but on the 1st day of the week , on Sunday . Something significantly amazing took place on one such Sunday . All this despite the fact that remembering the Sabbath day to keep it holly was one of the central ten commandments given to the Jewish people as it were before all generations . A forth form of historical support involves the fact that from the earliest recorded information of the church and onward , the resurrection formed a central part of the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses , Paul refers to passing onto the Corinthians that which he had learned and he uses words that often applied in a technical sense to the process of the transmission of oral traditions . The poetic structure and detachable nature of the creed in 1st Corinthians 15:3 , A scholar , by the name of Calling , suggested to many scholars , not just conservative ones , that Paul is recounting fundamental training he would have learned very shortly after becoming a believer , perhaps already in Ananias 's household . <p> ( In the following two paragraphs , the Lecturer is defending the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ by arguing against what the liberal scholar , Lutamen , who denies the resurrection openly , and tries to explain away the physical resurrection of Jesus . The Lecturer further argues against Jesus ' physical resurrection being only spiritual . ) <p> Lutamen , the liberal German Christian scholar , turned atheist , who though not a formal part of the Jesus Seminar but was influential in the deliberations of it in the 1990s , makes the stunning claim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe that Jesus objectively rose from the dead , he begin with the presupposition that we all know that this is simply scientifically impossible . Nevertheless , the proclamation of what for him was obviously a very real but subjectively experience of Jesus . As the resurrection had to be already well established by the time Paul became a believer which happened within a couple of years of Jesus ' death . In this , we may push the date back to within a year or even months of the crucifixion which Jesus ' followers believed they saw Jesus resurrected and alive again . The much more popular thinking , those who believed in the resurrection did not develop until a generation or two after the death of Christ and that it was taking what was originally the conviction that his spirit or his cause lived on in fleshing it the out by the very Jewish garb of the story of a bodily resurrection . That evolutionary hypothesis might have had some probability to it , had Jesus been a Greek ministering in Athens where immortality of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two centuries or even generations after his death , the message of his life had spread as far east as Israel and Jerusalem to be re-clothed in bodily trappings . But it is an utterly nonsensical hypothesis to account for a Jewish teacher revered by Jewish followers coming to the faith that they came to when in fact that the Gospel moved further and further afield from Jerusalem ; there would have been every reason to delete and diminish and play down the bodily part of the resurrection rather than to increasingly make it more central as the prevailing critical consensus requires . <p> With this , we have already gone well into the content of the fifth point on the PowerPoint slide , mainly that when one would have spoken of a resurrection in Jewish circles going all the way back to numerous Old Testament contexts that at the very latest , clearly in Daniel 12:2 and countless inter-testamental contexts that if anything moved in the sense of bodily resurrection almost in the direction of bodily resuscitation . While there is no question that the body has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no possibility that the first Jews couching their beliefs in language of the closing chapters of the Gospel could possibly have been that the resurrected body was only spiritual and not physical in any way . Nothing in 1st Corinthians 15 in any way contradicts this ; it does go on in the second half of the chapter to speak about the resurrection body as a spiritual body but it is in contrast to a natural body . The terms that are used are identical to those that appear in 1st Corinthians 2-3 contrasting that which is merely of this life verses the life to come and perhaps might better be rendered natural and supernatural bodies . <p> There is a change and clearly a perfecting and glorification and transformation of the nature of Jesus and believers ' bodies in the life to come , not least in not being limited by many of the same boundaries that limit what bodies can do in this life but there is no support for the notice that there are not in some way a physical and embodied form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly his magnificent and magisterial resurrection of the Son of God , dealing with all of the relevant New Testament passages after a very thorough study of all of the Old Testament and inter-testamental and Jewish Greco-Roman background , necessary to understand this concept . All it boils down to the simply but profound truth that the Christian Gospel because of the centrality of the Resurrection narrative and belief in a coming general resurrection of all people is fundamentally not about dying and going to heaven , not what is normally called life after death but about life after life after death , after the subsequent resurrection and combination in the eternal state of a new heaven and a new earth with fully embodied people . <p> One turns to the evangelical distinctives again , using the synoptics like that of the scholar , Alon , with its index or Table of Contents in the back with its unique kerygapi in bold face print . We see that given the overwhelming likelihood that the so called longer ending of Mark is late and not original , that Mark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrection appearance of Jesus , merely the prediction by the young man who has an angelical appearance . That the women are to tell the disciples to go and he will meet them in Galilee . Given the reliable prediction that have spanned the Gospel of Mark , we can assume however that such a command was ultimately obeyed and that Jesus did appear not withstanding Mark 's deliberate and abrupt ending of his Gospel with the initial response of women that fled from the tomb saying nothing to anyone because they were afraid . As we discussed and introduced the Gospel of Mark , here is the climax of the Messianic foretelling of the coming Jesus . But clearly Mark 's community would never have even become Christians had they not heard the afore Kerygma in which Jesus ' resurrection appearances did in fact take place . That they knew this and then did not see it narrated in Mark 's original ending makes his emphasis on the themes with which he ends that much greater . <p> Matthew 's Gospel , we see the distinctively point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wonderful ironic passage leads to the very rumor that the disciples stole the body that the Jewish rulers wanted to avoid . The greater interest in countering Jewish apologetics fits Matthew 's distinctively Jewish Christian concerns , but his emphasis on the great commission at the very end of the Gospel similarly fits the move from particularism to universalism throughout his texts and creates an inclusio with a number of the main themes of the beginning of his Gospel . Luke , alone , has the story of Cleopas and unnamed companion on the road to Emmaus . And the fulfillment of Scripture in Christ that Jesus incognito explains to them in root . He , alone , also briefly anticipates the full narrative of the ascension in Acts and if we are right in our hypothesis in our hourglass or extended inverse parallel structure to two items Luke and Acts put together , then the climatic center of that structure here in Luke 24 along with Acts 1 , appropriate for Luke 's emphasis throughout Acts on the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus as the theological core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see true humanity balanced by true divinity . Humanity in demonstrating to Thomas that Jesus truly was the same person that had been crucified to divinity in the confession given in response to this revelation by Thomas , my Lord and my God ' , and then in chapter 21 , the two major parts of the chapter , unified by the appearance of some sort of rivalry but one which is played down by the narrator of the Gospel between Peter and the beloved disciple . Perhaps reflective of situations in the church then of those who had begun to over exalt Peter and move in the direction of institutionalized later Roman Catholicism and which has also been called the anointed community , the still more small seat charismatic , autonomous , spirit led communities over which John had responsibility .

Good intentions are not enough . <p> What we 're going to do first of all is draw a continuum . And what a continuum means is , it is a graded scale . That means there are degrees here . Then , what we 're going to do is draw the names of 2 economic systems . Over here , towards the number 100 , we are going to write the word ' socialism ' . But because we are dealing with a continuum , it will become clear that are degrees of socialism in the world , right , just as there are degrees of statism . Do you see how these 2 continuums overlap ? And then over here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to write the word ' capitalism ' . And here again there will be degrees . But here 's where everybody goes wrong . There 's a 3rd economic system . And nobody or very few people talk about that third economic system . So we 're going to write the name of this third economic system and we 've got to give it 2 names . We can call it the mixed economy or we can call it interventionism . Now , we are also going to draw something else . We 're going to draw little umbrellas , somewhat like this . And it 's hard to describe . What we are showing here is that there are many degrees of capitalism . There are many degrees of socialism . And then we 're going to draw another little umbrella around interventionism . But we 're going to allow the umbrella for interventionism to overlap with socialism over here , or overlap with capitalism over here . Because at the extremes of interventionism it can become very difficult to figure out whether you are describing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism or you 're describing a very heavy , hard sense of interventionism that could easily be confused with socialism . <p> Now , one of the reasons why adding interventionism to this diagram is so important is this . Whenever anything goes wrong with the American economy , I 'll tell you what the real cause of it is . Whenever anything bad goes wrong with the American economy , it 's because of interventionism . Governmental intervention with the market place . But let me tell you what liberals have learnt to do . Now , maybe I should tell you what some of these bad things are that happened to the economy . Inflation is bad , recession is bad , depression is bad , unemployment is bad . Whenever anything bad goes wrong with the economy , even though the true cause of that badness is interventionism , guess which of these 3 systems liberals always blame for those failings ? They blame capitalism . Here 's the cause . The liberals blame capitalism , selfishness , greed , materialism and then let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretense to increase the amount of governmental intervention with the economy . They moved the failings that they have caused through their intervention to move the economy closer in the direction of socialism . They do . <p> I give an example . The Great Depression that started with the great stock market crash of October 1929 . And do you know how long that Great Depression lasted ? It was still going on when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . Now , forgive me for saying this . There are some people who think that the President at that time took actions that he knew would make war inevitable . And he did that , far be it for me to suggest something this conspiratorial . He did that in order to solve the employment in the country . Why ? Because suddenly we would have 10 million men under arms , 10 million men in the army , in the navy , in the armed services . Now , that might appear reckless to some people and I myself , of course , would never say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that may have gone on . But if you look at the Great Depression , let me back up , what do liberals blame for the Great Depression . They blame capitalist excesses during the 1920s . The Great Depression was the product of capitalism going crazy in the 1920s , and it made the Great Depression inevitable . I 've got 2 chapters about the Great Depression in my book ' Poverty and Wealth ' . And what those 2 chapters do is they tell you what the true causes of the Great Depression were and it was n't capitalism at all . You know what it was that caused it ? It was interventionism . And i tell you the forms of that interventionism took . And you know why the Depression of the 1930s did n't end ? It was because the government and the executive branch continued to make dumb mistake after dumb mistake and they made it worse . And many of those foolish mistakes were made by Herbert Hoover . Read chapters 11 and 12 . Now in much liberal literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Herbert Hoover was not . Herbert Hoover was an interventionist . Let me show you on this chart where Herbert Hoover stood in the early years of his Presidency . Right about here , who 's kind of an interventionist . <p> Let me tell you where Franklin Roosevelt stood during his first campaign for the Presidency . He stood over here . He made himself look less interventionist than Herbert Hoover . But as soon as Franklin Roosevelt became President , guess where he moved . He moved increasingly towards more and more governmental interference and intervention . Now somewhere in my 2 chapters , let 's just look at it . Let 's look at the unemployment numbers from the 1930s . Let me find the page right away . Maybe you did n't bring this book . The unemployment numbers for the 1930s , page 144 in this book . The number of unemployed people , average unemployed in 1929 was 429,000 . That was less than 1% of the late .. That 's incredible ! I had n't looked at that before . Less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immediately , 1930 , Hoover 's President . The unemployed percentage jumped to almost 8% . But even that , we have higher rates than that recently . Then it jumped to 16% , 25% , 25% , 20% . All of this being under Roosevelt . See . Now , what many people do n't know is that during his 2nd term , Roosevelt made a number of under the table agreements with the biggest labor unions . So that even though the recession was beginning to ease , and unemployment figures were going down , Roosevelt was so committed to statism that he made these agreements with the labor unions and look what happened . Immediately , after those new laws were passed , laws that favored the major labor unions , unemployment in 1937 had dropped to 12% . We were on our way out of the recession . But right after Roosevelt pushed through those new laws , unemployment jumped back up to almost 19% . Roosevelt is often described as the savior of America . He saved America from socialism . No he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only President in history who ever created a depression within a depression . He did . We were in the middle of a depression and he created a new one . Why ? Because of statist measures . <p> One more thing before I leave this . National economies move back and forth on this continuum . Let 's take 2 examples here . Let 's take first the example of communist China . In the mid 1970s , communist China was as far towards , .. Marxism and Leninism . It was as far towards Leninism . It was as far towards total statism economically that you could get . And you want to know what was going on in the Chinese economy ? They could n't feed their own people . The People 's Republic of China had to , what 's the word I want here , they had to buy foodstuff from other countries in order to prevent mass starvation . So I want to tell you what happened . Slowly , the people in communist China began to introduce small degrees of economic freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were growing the foodstuff throughout the People 's Republic of China to have little plots of ground . And guess what ? They produced more foodstuff through those privately farmed plots of land than the collective farms produced . And there had to be an incentive there so that people could sell their radishes , or their beets , or whatever they grew , and that gave them a little more pocket change . We have a name for that . We call it capitalist incentive , where you let people keep their own money . Sorry , do n't mean to get excited here . These little advances towards a market economy actually , it was a movement towards interventionism produced so much robustness in the Chinese economy that by the time you get to the mid or late 1980s communist China was exporting food to other countries . Largely other socialist countries which could n't feed their own people , see . <p> But during this process , the Chinese communists forgot 1 thing . Once you give people a taste of freedom , what do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And so you begin to get activists in communist China trying to get not just economic freedom but political freedom and then the horrible clashes in Beijing , in Tiananmen Square in 1989 occurred . The communists in China had a choice . They could sit back and let the people 's cry for more freedom go on until their safety , their security and their wealth , it was their wealth , was threatened , or else they clamped down and go back in this direction . And that 's what 's happened in communist China . Thousands of dissidents jailed . Many of them killed , wounded and that set back economic growth in China for a long time . <p> Now another story . The Soviet Union . The Soviet Union also could not feed itself , its people . But something different happened . Gorbachev took a different tact . Not that he was a noble man , even though he got the Nobel Peace Prize . What the totalitarian in Russia or the Soviet Union did was not done out of a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew this thing was rapidly getting out of control . So they moved in the Glasnost and all of that other stuff , never thinking that it would get out of control until finally in the fall of August or September of 1991 , the Soviet Union collapsed . Now , some people had wondered about a possible coincidence here . I delivered my lectures in Moscow in May and June of 1991. 2 months later the Soviet Union collapsed . Is there any connection ? I do n't know . I do n't know . Could be . I 'll tell you this . I myself could not imagine anything more exciting than being part , being there to watch this . Not so much in 1991 but when I went back and I honestly believed that the Soviet Union or Russia was going to make it . I really believed they were going to make it . They were moving in this direction . They had a stock market . They were moving towards interventionism . And I fell in love with those people . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw such horrible poverty in your life . <p> The typical Soviet family lived in an 800 square foot flat . That 's all of the room , 800 sq feet . And while I was over there , they told me about , this was an old couple . They just wanted to live their last years together and then they were ready to die but 1 day the knock came on their door . They had 800sq feet and because of the shortage of housing , the secret police , or whatever , they said , we 're going to move in a young couple . And what they did was they built a bed over the kitchen stove for the couple to sleep on . No freedom at all . You ca n't let those people die in peace . So , but what nobody predicted was the venality , the criminality , the corruption of the politicians and the rise of the Russian mafia . Where politicians would sell their souls and their votes for whatever the mafia would give them and today , maybe someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old government probably could n't hold a candle to the corruption of the criminals in the Soviet Union . <p> Now , what I want to do next , I 'm going to give you definitions of these 3 terms . I 'm going to give you a definition of Socialism . I 'm going to give you a definition of interventionism , and then I 'll give you a definition of capitalism . Now , here 's my definition of Socialism . You can compare my definition of Socialism with that of some of the religious left guys that I quote later on . For example , and I do n't mean any of this in any kind of pejorative way . Intervarsity Press published a horrible book called " The Good News of the Kingdom Coming " , in which the author of the book , and I name him in my book on the " Religious Left " , thanks God for Socialism , for Marxism because it leads to the growing dignity of human beings . Oh man ! Well , here is the true nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle . And way at the top of the triangle is a group of people that we call the central planners . Now , they are the State . They are the people who decide . <p> There used to be a joke in Russia . Can I remember ? Some big shot bureaucrat in the Russian government , he says I 've got good news and bad news . What 's the good news ? For making you Commissioner of Agriculture . laugh What 's the bad news ? You got to produce at least these many tons of corn and cattle and pigs and if you do n't we are going to shoot you . That 's the bad news . That 's what we call a command economy . And I 'm going to tell you something . You do n't produce cows , pigs , goats and wheat by snapping your fingers . You do n't do it that way . This is a command economy in which all power flows from the top down . And that 's the opposite of a market economy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here where the people live without coercion from government . Now , some of you must be thinking . " Hey , Nash , what you 're calling a market economy which must be capitalism does n't sound like America " . Did I say this was America ? I said this is what capitalism is . Please understand the American economy is not a capitalist economy . The American economy is an interventionist economy . <p> Let 's go back to my 3 systems . The American economy is and has been , maybe in perpetuity . It 's an interventionist economy . Now , there is a difference . If 1 of our political parties takes control , the interventionism will grow more and more severe . If the other political party takes control , there will be definite movement in the direction of a market economy and less interventionism . Now what are the names ? I have no idea here . Help me out . What are the names of these 2 political parties ? Which political party , which one in power tends to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that political party again ? No , come on . I 've been fair all semester . The Democrats , thank you . You 're right , the Democrats . It 's amazing . There 's ground swell of opinion here . And what do we call this other party ? With some exceptions we call it the Republican Party , OK ? But there are different kinds of Republicans , are there not ? There is Ronald Reagan who was clearly pushing us in this direction . Then there was Richard Nixon who took a big about face and he became an interventionist almost beyond all interventionists . He imposed wage and price controls . <p> I 'll tell you a true story . The year was 1970 , I think it was right after Nixon 's second election . He imposed controls such that a lot of education institutions felt that they were forbidden to grant raises to their employees . I got to be very careful here because people involved in this were good friends of mine . We had a very good guy as President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . But , some of us were a little angry at Richard Nixon . You would n't think I 'm capable of doing this , but I and another member of the faculty met secretly with a reporter from the Louisville Courier Journal . That 's the big liberal newspaper in the state of Kentucky . And we leaked a story but he was pledged not to reveal our identities . The rascal . Dirty rat . " No one will ever know who you guys are " . OK . And we raised a protest about the fact that we were n't going to get any raises and this was a enorgen ? ? and unjustifiable interpretation of the law . I mean we could get raises . The newspaper came out the next day . I ran to our faculty house , open it up and that reporter quoted a bald headed department head . I knew I was a dead duck . So , I went right to the office of the President and I said you might as well know that I am the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought it was funny thing that I got caught like that . He said , " That 's alright , Nash . I wo n't fire you . I 'll let somebody else do it " . Maybe in 20 years someone else will get you . I do n't know . That really happened , OK ? Listen whenever you get caught like that , do n't wait , do n't let them catch you . You go right down and admit that you did it . I think we finally got our raises , I do n't know . I must have gotten an extra 100 dollars or so . So , that 's interventionism . <p> One more point . Do n't ever let anybody fool you into thinking that Hitler 's Nazi movement was supportive of Capitalism . Do n't you ever let anybody kid you . Hitler was a socialist . Nazi was a derivation of national socialism . So the Soviets , and the Nazis , this was not a clash between right and left , this was a clash between 2 socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascism was actually a kind of state , what we could call , well , it was heavily Statist . There 's no need to try to do that any further
