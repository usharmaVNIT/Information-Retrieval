@@58820789 @7820789/ <h> California and B&amp;N Reach Settlement on Back Sales Tax <p> In a significant victory for California 's independent booksellers , the state 's Board of Equalization ( BOE ) and Barnes &amp; Noble have settled two cases regarding the collection of sales and use taxes on sales made by Barnesandnoble.com . On Thursday , May 29 , the California BOE affirmed and approved a settlement that has B&amp;N paying a settlement of approximately $9 million . <p> The BOE investigation into whether Barnesandnoble.com had nexus in the state of California was spurred by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association . " I 'm delighted that the BOE pursued this matter to its conclusion , although I 'm sorry it took nine years , " said Hut Landon , NCIBA executive director . " This case sets a precedent of sorts in that Barnes &amp; Noble argued from the start , up until they assumed total ownership over Barnesandnoble.com , that the two were separate corporations , and therefore the website was not subject to nexus . Our contention from day one was that their website was an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , and the two conducted cross-marketing and promotional efforts .... I am pleased that they rejected Barnes &amp; Noble 's interpretation of nexus . " <p> Barnes &amp; Noble 's contention that its California-based bricks-and-mortar stores did not constitute nexus for Barnesandnoble.com , because they were two legally separate entities , " sounds a lot like Amazon.com 's current contention in Texas , " added Landon . ( At present , the state of Texas is investigating whether Amazon.com 's Irving , Texas , distribution facility constitutes a physical presence in the state . Amazon has stated that the facility does not because it is owned by an Amazon subsidiary . ) <p> The $9 million agreement settles two cases : a BOE audit for a four-month period in late 1999 during which Barnesandnoble.com offered online users coupons redeemable in Barnes &amp; Noble stores ; and a full-scale audit of the website that the BOE launched in 2003 .

NCIBA sent the coupons to the BOE in the hopes that they would investigate Barnes &amp; Noble , which the BOE did . " We were like , what else do you need ? " Landon told BTW in 2002 . " If this is n't a clear case of nexus , what is ? " <p> In September 2002 , the BOE ruled that Barnesandnoble.com was obligated to pay California back use taxes for a period of four-plus months , which Barnes &amp; Noble appealed . <p> A year later , the BOE voted to conduct a full-scale audit of Barnes&amp;Noble.com to determine if the online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 2005 , the staff of the BOE completed the audit and delivered the opinion to its Board that Barnesandnoble.com has nexus in the state and that the chain retailer owed approximately $20 million in back taxes , sources close to the BOE told BTW at the time .

@@58820809 @7820809/ <h> The Son of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Writes of An Execution in the Family <p> June 19 , 2003 , marks the 50th anniversary of the executions of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg for " conspiracy to commit espionage . " Although the highly publicized case has always been referred to as a trial for treason and high-level atomic espionage -- passing the secret of the atom bomb to the Soviet Union -- those crimes were not charged . No one has ever proven that the Rosenbergs , left-wing , Jewish parents of two young boys , living on the lower east side of Manhattan , passed any classified materials of any kind . Theirs has been the only capital conspiracy case in the United States since the Civil War . <p> Their story has elements of operatic intensity -- Ethel and Julius Rosenberg died by electrocution after Ethel 's brother and his wife , David and Ruth Greenglass , told the FBI that Julius and Ethel had recruited them into their spy network . The Greenglasses saved their own lives by accusing members of their family with crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower intoned , " The Rosenbergs may have condemned to death tens of millions of innocent people all over the world . " Many thousands of people worldwide , including Albert Einstein and Pope Paul XII , petitioned for their clemency . Four appeals to the Supreme Court were denied but days before the scheduled execution , Justice William O. Douglas granted a stay on the grounds that the couple might have been tried under the wrong law , a legal avenue never pursued . The next day , the entire Supreme Court was hurriedly called back for a special session and voted six to three to immediately vacate Douglas ' stay so that the executions could proceed . On Friday afternoon , June 19 , 1953 , the Court announced their decision and Eisenhower once again refused to grant clemency , so officials at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining , New York , hurriedly prepared for the executions to be conducted prior to sundown , out of respect for the Jewish Sabbath . Time was so short that the Rosenbergs were not given the traditional last meals before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rosenberg case continues to generate passion and controversy . As various classified documents are released and examined , new theories have emerged . Much of the emotion of their trial and its outcome has always focused on the couple 's two children , Michael , who was 10 at the time of the execution , and Robert , who was six . In those few moments in 1953 , the boys lost both parents , their former lives , and acquired permanent renown as " the Rosenberg children . " <p> Robert Meeropol , nee Rosenberg , has written An Execution in the Family : One Son 's Journey ( St. Martin 's Press ) that " is a product of my parents ' case , but is not primarily about it . " Meeropol is the founder and executive director of the Rosenberg Fund for Children ( RFC ) , an attorney , anti-death penalty activist , and speaker . <p> BTW interviewed him by telephone at the RFC office in Easthampton , Massachusetts . <p> You and your brother are Meeropols . Why not Rosenbergs ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed around to relatives , friends , and even a children 's shelter in the Bronx . I describe the different situations in the book . There was little stability , and we were very unhappy . Abel and Anne Meeropol offered to adopt us in 1950 , but my parents did n't want us to go with people they did n't know . In late 1953 , our parents ' attorney and our guardian , Manny Bloch agreed to the adoption but then died suddenly before the transfer of legal guardianship was completed . The adoption was contested by some conservative groups , and we were removed from the Meeropol 's home and sent to an orphanage temporarily . Eventually we were adopted and immediately took their name . A psychologist advised Abel and Anne that this would minimize questions by outsiders about our backgrounds and help to create a normal family life . <p> I think of both sets of people as my parents but I only spent my first three years in the Rosenberg home . We had a very warm and happy home with the Meeropols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is this the first time you have told your story ? <p> Michael and I maintained our anonymity until 1973 when trial lawyer Louis Nizer wrote a book about the trial , publishing large sections of our parents ' prison correspondence without our permission . For his own purposes , Nizer eliminated all references to my brother and me in the letters . To sue him for copyright violations and correct these misrepresentations , we had to " go public . " When we finally did it , it was a relief . Since then , we have been openly involved in the effort to reopen the Rosenberg case . We were advised , in 1975 , by the legal teams seeking to reopen the case , that we should write a book to circulate our parents ' prison correspondence to as many people as possible . I only wrote 80 pages of the book ( We Are Your Sons , Houghton Mifflin ) . It was really done as a package to wrap around the letters . My brother has also edited their complete prison letters The Rosenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Routledge is bringing them out . An Execution in the Family is the book I really wanted to write ; it feels like the first . <p> You are founder and executive director of the Rosenberg Fund for Children ( RFC ) . You 've called the RFC your constructive revenge . What does the RFC do ? <p> The RFC provides for the educational and emotional needs of children whose parents have suffered because of their progressive activities and who are no longer able to provide fully for their children . The RFC also provides grants for the educational and emotional needs of targeted activist youth . Targeted activists could be a whistle-blower in a nuclear power plant , an environmentalist who is harassed or attacked , or a prisoner who is placed in solitary confinement for working on a newspaper . People have a hard time believing that these things go on in this country . It 's not a huge number of people , but if it happens in your family- . <p> Grants cover any number of things -- art or music lessons , school tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarcerated family member . We have awarded over $1 million since its inception in 1990 . When we were young , my brother and I were very fortunate to have so much support from the Rosenberg Defense Committee , Communist Party members , other sympathizers , as well as the Meeropols . They all saved us . At the RCF , we focus on American children who might be overwhelmed by the world . <p> Who was responsible for the execution of your parents ? <p> There are layers of answers . On the simplest level , the person responsible was Judge Irving Kaufman who sentenced them to death . He did n't have to impose the death penalty but he was politically ambitious and thought he might ultimately get a seat on the Supreme Court , which was difficult for any Jew . Had he not sentenced my parents to death -- he knew he would never make it . <p> In a more general way , the death sentence was part of a government strategy to extort cooperation - if my parents said what the government wanted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent said years ago , " We did n't want them to die , we wanted them to talk . " <p> Their trial and execution served the government 's purposes at a time of war in Korea . Judge Kaufman said , " These people have done something worse than murder . " What ? Everyone agrees there was nothing of value stolen . At the time , there was a general policy of frightening the American people about communism . Now , after 50 years , the government is frightening people , trying to convince us that we have to give up our freedoms . They claim that if we do n't , we 're going to be destroyed . This book is not about history , it 's about today . <p> Now we have big protest marches again -- take out the word communist and insert terrorists . When we step back years from now , we 'll see that this looks like a massive overreach- . I think our way of life is more threatened by the USA Patriot Act than by Osama Bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Were their convictions solely the result of a government frame up ? Do you feel that you have vindicated them ? <p> For many years , when speaking around the country about my parents ' case , I have presented the same major points : First , my parents had not stolen the secret of the atom bomb ; second , they had not committed the act they were killed for ; third , the government knew this and executed them anyway ; and , fourth , I could not prove that neither one of them ever had any contact with the KGB between their marriage in 1930 and arrest in 1950 . <p> This way , I demonstrated that they were framed , but I had not proved them completely innocent . I was regularly asked by the press if I sought my parents ' vindication . In the 1970s I always said yes ; by the ' 90s , I was saying no . I wanted to force both the American and Russian governments to release all their secret files . I became an agnostic in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my mother was never involved . <p> From documents released in the late 1970s , I knew that David Greenglass had always maintained that my mother his sister was not involved in spying . From the files , I learned that weeks before the trial , in a secret meeting , government officials acknowledged the weak case against my mother , and then Ruth and David Greenglass gave the FBI a new version claiming that my mother was present at their meetings and had typed up David 's handwritten notes describing the atomic bomb . On December 5 , 2001 , in a televised interview on Sixty Minutes II , David Greenglass finally admitted that he had lied under oath when he stated during the trial that he remembered my mother typing his notes . Even more significantly , J. Edgar Hoover , chief government prosecutor Irving Saypol and his assistant Roy Cohn , all knew at the time of her arrest that she was not an espionage agent . <p> Will we ever know more about the Rosenberg case ? <p> I 'm sure we will . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still get posthumous publishing of accounts . What comes out may or may not be accurate . So far the KGB files are largely closed so that everything from CIA and FBI files , including the Venona transcripts , are without corroboration . In 1974 , we had to sue the FBI , CIA , and other government agencies to force the release of the 300,000 secret documents relating to their case . The government had to pay us $295,802.50 for our legal fees . <p> The current administration has stopped all FOIA Freedom of Information Act requests . There are still 100,000 pages of the Rosenberg file kept secret . Maybe they will be released . -- Interviewed by Nomi Schwartz

@@58820877 @7820877/ <h> Books + Booze an Old ( and Profitable ) Mix <p> Offering books and wine or beer is " a really old idea , sort of like a salon or an old school pub , " where ideas and alcohol mix , said Jessica Puglisi of The Spotty Dog Books &amp; Ale in Hudson , New York . Installing a bar can be a moneymaker , even if just a modest selection of wines and beers are sold . Booksellers from The Spotty Dog , I Know You Like a Book , and Taylor Books recently talked to BTW about the profitability and logistics of selling beer and wine at the bookstore . <p> Spotty Dog Books and Ale owner Kelley Drahushuk 's great , great , great grandfather was the mayor of Hudson ( between 1868 and 1872 ) and the owner of a brewery . " His namesake , my uncle C.H. Evans IV , now operates a brewpub that makes great beer , " said Drahushuk , the co-owner of Spotty Dog with her husband , Alan Coon . When she and Coon wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle suggested they also sell beer . " I said ' No ! ' The rest , as they say is history : a bookstore/art supply/lounge . I 'm happy I was over-ruled . " <p> Mary Beth Nebel , whose I Know You Like a Book in Peoria Heights , Illinois , now features a four-foot wine bar , got the idea from her customers . " I had one customer who would come into the store just about every Friday afternoon , " said Nebel . " She would buy a book and say that she was going down the street to a local bar to have a glass of wine and start reading . I figured if I had a wine bar , I could keep the customers here longer . " <p> Spotty Dog 's combination of beer/art supplies/books was described as " the holy trinity " by one happy customer , but " I would n't go that far , " said Drahushuk . " I would say that people really enjoy the fact that we have beer and wine " and appreciate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a nice adult beverage while your kids hang out , too . " <p> And happier customers staying longer lead to increased sales . " A common joke among first-time customers runs along the lines of ' Oh , get me drunk in a bookstore , I 'm gon na buy the whole store ! ' " said Puglisi . " Though this has n't yet happened , that we have customers spending much longer than they might in a non-beer store and interfacing with the booksellers as they receive shipments means that there 's an increased opportunity for handselling and spontaneous recommendations . Books often get put on the bar to settle some sort of friendly debate , and this will often turn into an impulse purchase . " <p> Furthermore , she said , " the bar allows us to have more in-depth relationships with customers and to discuss all matter of things , including books , than just having a coffee service would necessarily support . The more you talk to your customers , the better you can know what they will want to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger at the store , " serving beer and wine lends itself well to using the bookstore as a different type of events space , " said Puglisi . " We 've been able to develop a really strong evening and music-listening bar scene , which has been made possible largely because we are a partially a bar . " <p> A busier events calendar has also spurred sales . Puglisi said that bi-weekly Quiz Nights have a rabid following of people , and many have become loyal book customers . " From the Quiz Night devotees , we 've seen at least one Book Club evolve . It 's really easy to entice Book Clubs with something beyond coffee . " <p> I Know You Like a Book 's Nebel suggested that adding beer and wine is " something other indies should consider . " Her customers , she explained , " always make a point of bringing their guests to the store , because it 's not something that they would typically experience in their own city . " <p> It also suits the bookstore 's Peoria Heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookstore/wine bar fits with the other businesses , " Nebel said . " There are unique retailers and upscale restaurants in a two- to three-block area . " <p> Drahushuk noted that under New York State law , a business is required to offer food if alcohol is served . Spotty Dog 's menu includes cheese plates and other snacks , and there are always pretzels on the bar . Even if the state did n't require it , Spotty Dog would still serve something to eat , and Drahushuk advises other booksellers who are considering adding a bar to do the same . " Totally serve food , " she said . " Drinking on an empty stomach equals bad news . I do n't think you need to have a restaurant , just some snacks . " <p> Waggener agreed . " Even if you only offer noshes/cheese plates/snack mixes and the like , not offering food with alcohol is just a bad idea . Not to mention a loss of profit possibility ! " <p> " Selling wine and beer without selling food works for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " noted Nebel . " Customers are free to wander throughout the store with their beverages . I also sell a few wine-related sidelines such as a Napa Valley soap that 's made with wine grapes , cocktail napkins , and bottle stoppers . " <p> Asked if there were any caveats to selling beer and wine , Drahushuk said , " The book/beer crowd is a bit more considerate than your typical bar crowd , so we 've only had to bounce one person in five years , but should have bounced a couple of others ( especially the one who barfed all over our bathroom ) . " <p> To minimize problems ( and clean up ) , she said , " Make sure your servers are not timid and have good sense about carding , not serving people when they should n't be served , etc . Also , serve quality products , and you will get people out to enjoy one or two delicious beverages , not to go on a binge . Unique micro-brew beers go well with books . Train your staff so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( alcohol content , styles , dry versus sweet , etc . ) . " <p> The primary concern , once a business decides to add beer and wine , is the liquor license , both in terms of costs and legal requirements , said Nebel . " You have to figure in the cost of licenses , liquor liability insurance , equipment , and product . In Illinois , beer and wine must be purchased from a licensed distributor , and the state liquor commission checks the premises once or twice a year for compliance . " Nebel added that she only had one underage person try to buy a glass of wine . " When I asked for her I 'd , she ran out of the store . " <p> Once the appropriate licenses are obtained , opening a wine bar does n't necessarily mean stocking dozens and dozens of wines . At I Know You Like at Book , " usually , it 's three whites , three reds , and three types of beer , " said Nebel . " Spoilage can be a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle . That way , it 's at least break even . Prices on wine range from $4 to $7 . " <p> All three booksellers agreed that being able to sit down with a drink is a big value-add for customers . " Wine has been a nice accompaniment to our clientele 's overall experience of the store , " said Waggener . " If handled properly , it can be a nice addition and enhancement to the spirit of the independent bookseller environment . " <p> For Puglisi , a bookstore with a bar improved more than just margins : " The effect of having a bar atmosphere in a bookstore is , in my opinion , a great equalizer , and supplies a social lubricant that helps to realize the community potential held by independent bookstores . Beyond supplying books to a community , a bookstore supplies ideas , and there are few more surefire ways to get people talking than to offer them a drink in a comfortable space . "

A survey from American Express , which was conducted in mid-October and included 800 heads of households , found that consumers were planning to spend $1,073 on gifts in 2002 , up $29 from the year before . A holiday survey conducted by the consulting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche also found that shoppers were planning to carefully watch their gift-giving spending , with 64 percent noting that they would spend more or the same this year , and 36 percent saying they were planning on spending less . <p> However , there were positive indicators for booksellers , as survey results showed a strong interest in books as gifts . The Deloitte &amp; Touche survey showed that books were the fourth most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music/DVDs . The AmEx survey highlighted books as big winners in 2002 , with 51 percent of consumers indicating that they would be giving books as gifts , up from 44 percent in 2001 . <p> In addition , both surveys confirmed ABA research that underscores the important role gift certificates play in retail success . Over 50 percent of those surveyed by Deloitte &amp; Touche said they would be purchasing gift certificates , and 72 percent in the AmEx survey reported that they would give " gift certificates , cash , or gift cheques . " <p> Given the popularity of gift certificates , booksellers should take the time to check stock and reorder Book Sense gift certificates , said Jill Perlstein , marketing services director for ABA . " With a gift certificate that is recognized in independent stores nationwide , stores with Book Sense have a great opportunity to ensure that customers are provided with a service that they clearly value , " she noted . <p> If pre-holiday surveys are correct , those retailers who deliver strong customer service and convenience will profit in 2002 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , and value drive channels in which consumers choose to shop " and that this emphasis on value can be found in all income groups .

It revealed that those surveyed reported that satisfaction for Internet shopping is higher than for bricks-and-mortar stores .

This is a retirement community , and they buy a lot for relatives elsewhere . " <p> Over the years , Page and Palette has become the center of the town-s many cultural activities .

With a winning smile and a mien that combined bookish uncle with friendly academic , Ellsberg looked engaging and relaxed , especially for a man who had been arrested that day at a Manhattan anti-war rally at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations . <p> However , after waiting for a few hours in a packed holding cell for processing by police , Ellsberg and his 25-year-old son , Michael ( arrested for the first time that day ) , had stopped for a quick burrito before heading to the panel , " Government Secrecy , War , and the First Amendment .

" We are in a period of growing government censorship , " Finan said , pointing to such examples as the Bush Administration 's " more restrictive policy on Freedom of Information requests " and the provisions of the USA Patriot Act that permit the FBI to conduct secret searches of bookstore and library records . " The current administration has a particular fondness for secrecy , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and to talk about government secrets . " <p> Ellsberg presented the audience with a little-known legal point and a provocative hypothetical question . He noted that in 1971 , while facing a possible 115 years in prison for leaking the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times , the Washington Post , and many other U.S. newspapers , his legal team discovered that the country " has no official secrets act . " Thus , despite official denunciations , Ellsberg 's " unauthorized disclosures " of classified material had not violated any laws , he contended . <p> This revelation , however , did not mean that Ellsberg no longer faced the prospect of jail . As he noted , when he expressed optimism to his lawyer , Leonard Boudin , the lawyer replied that there was still a fifty-fifty chance Ellsberg would be convicted .

However , Ellsberg speculated , what if Clinton had not blocked the bill ? Under a more restrictive climate , the publication of Bob Woodward 's Bush at War -- " which gives us the contents of classified documents , " Ellsberg noted -- could set off a provocative legal showdown . <p> While the publication of the book would have broken no laws , Woodward could be called before a grand jury , where he could be questioned regarding who leaked classified materials to him .

In small business , these may include accounting , Web site design , deliveries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , and human resource functions such as payroll . Hire to cover your weakness , do n't try to do everything yourself because , more than likely , you will do it poorly . 3 . Delegate routine activities , even though you do n't want to : routine activities such as fact-finding assignments , collection of data for reports , photocopying , printing and collating , and data entry . You need to focus your time and your skills , so get someone else to handle these activities . 4 . Talk to your staff members . Find out their competencies . Sometimes all skills do not come out in an interview . It is critical that you know some of the key , hidden skills of your staff . You do not want to frustrate yourself and your staff by trying to fit a perfect round peg into a square hole . 5 .

Create a plan to delegate . Do n't give out assignments haphazardly. 2 . Invest short-term time in training to gain a long-term increase in productivity . ( Do n't undermine your delegating process by shortchanging the training needed : " See , I knew no one could do it as well as I can . He failed so it proves I 'm the person for the job . " ) 3 . Realize that others may end up doing a better job than you can or may find new ways to complete a task . <p> Delegation instructions <p> 1 . Delegate the objective , not the procedure . Outline the desired result , not the methodology . 2 . Ask for a progress report at certain times . Do n't wait until something goes wrong or a deadline is passed before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how things are going . 3 . Delegate to the right person . Do n't always give tasks to the strongest , most experienced , or first available person . Spread delegation around . 4 . Obtain feedback from staff to ensure they feel they 're being treated appropriately . A simple " How 's it going with that new project ? " might be all that 's needed . 5 . Be sure to delegate the authority along with the responsibility . Do n't make people come back to you with too many minor approvals. 6 . Trust people to do well and do n't look over their shoulders . 7 . When you finish giving instructions , the last thing to ask is " What else do you need to get started ? " They 'll tell you . 8 .

It is generally true that people will be more committed to working on projects that they had some input in developing . Therefore , it is important to bring people in at the first stages of an idea , rather than at the moment that something needs to be done . You might even want to consider forming a committee , if the task warrants it , to define the tasks and deadlines . 2 . Assign responsibilities . This is the stage we usually associate with delegating . If the planning has been done well , there should be few problems finding people willing to take on the necessary responsibilities . Be enthusiastic . Delegate important tasks as well as less important ones . People are more likely to be willing to do the grunt work if they have a chance to contribute to the decision-making . Try to make every task a learning experience . It might be better to ask , " Who would like to learn to make flyers for the next event ? " in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your expectations and get a commitment : Explain clearly what needs to happen and by when ; you may then negotiate the timeline or specific parts of the assignment , but be sure you come up with an agreement that you both can commit to . 3 .

Be encouraging ; express your confidence in their abilities , encourage creativity and be tolerant of risk-taking and mistakes . Hold staff members accountable ; remind them of their commitment and , if they can not fulfill their obligation , ask them to suggest a solution that will get the job done .
