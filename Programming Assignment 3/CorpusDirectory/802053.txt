 Fontana reflects on what 's expected to be his final full day in office , the race is heating up to find his replacement , both in the short term and for the long haul . <p> Thursday 's news conference , where Fontana plans to officially resign following his conviction on three fraud-related charges , has prompted several prominent Londoners to make their intentions known ahead of the municipal election on October 27th . <p> Unlike the field for becoming interim Mayor , which appears to be quite narrow , the race to win a 4-year term remains wide open . <p> After announcing his candidacy for Mayor months ago , Councillor Matt Brown remains the biggest and most recognizable name in the race thus far . <p> However , that may not last .

 join several other Canadian cities in providing drug users with access to free crack pipes . <p> The proposal received unanimous support at Thursday night 's meeting of the Middlesex-London Board of Health . <p> Despite concerns the plan will enable drug users , supporters believe it will help better protect them from harm . <p> Some of the key points included in the report suggest limited availability of safer smoking supplies have resulted in sharing of supplies . This may lead to increased infections and use of makeshift equipment that can cause injury . <p> " Currently , we do n't provide any smoking equipment for them , and often people who smoke crack will be doing things like using pop cans or tearing an aerial off a car to use that because their addiction is so strong that they 'll use whatever they can , " said Dr. Christopher Mackie , Medical Officer of Health and CEO of the Middlesex London Health Unit . <p> The report also suggests that by distributing safer smoking supplies , London is expected to see a decrease in the transmission of HIV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack cocaine . <p> " When you look at the research around this sort of program , it really does help prevent the spread of infectious diseases , " said Dr. Mackie .

These programs really are effective , and bring people into a care environment , who are otherwise on the margins of society . " <p> Supporters of the proposal acknowledged that no matter how you consume it , crack will never be safe . However , offering safer smoking supplies could create opportunities to engage with users safe practices , addiction treatment , income assistance , etc . <p> The initiative is similar to the harm-reduction strategy used by the Health Unit , where needle drug users can access free clean syringes .

 First Official Day of Summer <p> After a cold , dreary winter and less than desirable start to spring , it looks as though we could see the pay off for that in the coming months . <p> Summer officially arrived with the summer solstice at 6:51 a.m . Saturday and weather officials are predicting normal , seasonable and average conditions throughout July , August and September . <p> Senior Climatologist with Environment Canada David Phillips looks back at what we 've been through to get here . <p> " We went through a period right through to April of probably about six to seven months in a row with below normal temperatures , not getting a break at all .

" <p> As far as active weather goes , Phillips says there 's plenty of that still to come . <p> " We do get that , we 've already had a bout of that . We 've had three tornados , we get normally 12 on average for a year , lots of lightning , and hail , and heavy rains , and strong winds , but that should n't scare us . We could probably see a normal kind of summer with a few bouts of extreme weather and we 'd say , wow , it was just a summer that was called for , it was sort of typical . " <p> Now that we 've had our summer solstice , the days will start to get shorter . Conversely , the Southern Hemisphere had it 's winter solstice Saturday and will start to see longer days as they approach their summertime . <p> For the first week of summer , Phillips is calling for a chance of mild rain . <p> " In the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days with precipitation in the London area , but every one of those days is like a 30 percenter .

 awash with light and love as Londoners gathered to remember a little girl with a big heart Wednesday night . <p> Upwards of 2,000 people drove , walked and rode their bikes into the quiet corner of the park for a candlelight vigil in honour of six-year-old Addison Hall . <p> The young child died last week after she , her three-year-old sister Miah Bozek and their pregnant mother Danah McKinnon-Bozek were struck by a reversing car at the entrance of the south London Costco on Wellington Rd .

 Group of SUVs For Third Time <p> General Motors ' troubles with safety recalls have surfaced in another case , this time with the company recalling a group of SUVs for a third time to fix power window switches that can catch fire . <p> The problem , revealed in documents posted by federal safety regulators this week , is so serious that GM is telling customers to park the SUVs outdoors until they are repaired because they could catch fire when left unattended . <p> The vehicles could be left outside for a while . Parts wo n't be ready until October at the earliest , according to GM . The automaker also has ordered its dealers to stop selling the SUVs as used cars until they are fixed . <p> The recall covers about 189,000 vehicles in North America , mainly from the 2006 and 2007 model years . Models affected include the Chevrolet TrailBlazer , GMC Envoy , Buick Rainer , Isuzu Ascender and Saab 97-X . The recall was one of six announced by GM on June 30 that covered 7.6 million vehicles . <p> GM is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , touched off by the delayed recall of 2.6 million older small cars to fix faulty ignition switches . The company has issued a record 60 recalls this year covering nearly 29 million vehicles . <p> Before this year , GM had been reluctant to issue recalls , at times opting for lower-cost fixes for safety problems . It 's been fined million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for lapses in reporting the ignition switch problems , which it blames for at least 13 deaths . <p> After the ignition switch debacle , GM did a companywide safety review , appointed a new global safety chief and pledged to recall cars quickly . <p> The SUV problem first appeared early in 2012 when NHTSA began investigating consumer complaints of fires in the switches that control power windows . <p> At first , GM tried to address the issue with a " service campaign , " where it sent letters to owners telling them that water can find its way into the switches , causing rust that can result in short circuits , overheating and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extended the warranty and offered service only to vehicles that exhibited the problems . It was limited to 20 states and Washington , D.C. , where salt is used to clear roads in the winter . <p> But in August of 2012 , under government pressure , GM recalled 278,000 of the SUVs in the cold-weather states and offered extended warranties to the rest of the country . NHTSA kept investigating , and 10 months later , GM expanded the recall nationwide . <p> By then , NHTSA and GM had received 242 complaints , including 28 about fires . There were no injuries . <p> In one complaint filed with NHTSA from October of 2008 , a woman reported that the alarm sounded while her 2006 TrailBlazer was parked in her driveway . When she looked outside , it was in flames . Firefighters put out the blaze and told her it started in the driver 's door . <p> " The fire burned the entire driver 's side of the vehicle , a portion of the front passenger seat and the roof , " she wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fix used by GM last year was to put a protective coating around the window switch circuit boards , which is less costly than replacing the switches . But starting this April , GM received complaints that the switches malfunctioned in SUVs that had been repaired . So in June , it decided to do the third recall and replace all of the switches . <p> " We are recalling them because the fix that we put in did not work , " spokesman Alan Adler said Thursday . " We 're taking care of it . We 're doing the right thing . " <p> Initially GM tried the service campaign because number of incidents was low , he said . It was limited to the cold-weather states because salty water made the switches corrode quickly and incidents were few in warmer states , Adler said . <p> Letters notifying owners about the SUV recall should be mailed soon . Owners will get a second letter sometime from October to December telling them when parts are available to fix the vehicles . <p> Pam Dyer ,

In all , it would take a train 71 minutes to get from downtown London to downtown Toronto at a speed of about . <p> The plan has an estimated net cost of about million , as apart of Premier Kathleen Wynne 's billion dollar transportation masterplan . <p> Mayor Joni Baechler represented London in the discussion . <p> " We are pleased that the province has committed to explore high speed rail .

 a Sarnia woman who was brutally murdered is appealing for the public 's help to keep her killer locked up , and perhaps change our country 's legal system . <p> Stephanie Nethery ( pictured , right , in an undated family photo beside her sister Jessica ) is collecting signatures ahead of a parole hearing next month in B.C. where the man responsible for murdering her sister Jessica could be granted new freedoms . <p> Jeremy Molitor was under a restraining order to stay away from Jessica Nethery , due to prior abuse and threatens made against her , when he attacked her in Sarnia on May 4th , 2002 . <p> Molitor stabbed Jessica 58 times and left her alone in a locked car , where the bled to death . Molitor was convicted of second-degree murder on December 22nd , 2004 .

You can find the petition by clicking here . <p> She 's frustrated her family has to travel to B.C. to deliver it to the parole board . <p> " We do n't really have a choice , " Stephanie said .

 Truck Pilot Project Passes First Hurdle <p> Food trucks are one step closer to hitting the roads in London , at least on a trial basis . <p> The Community and Protective Services Committee voted early Tuesday evening 6-0 in favour of sending Mayor Matt Brown and Councillor Josh Morgan 's motion to revive the food truck pilot project on to staff for further review . <p> Brown and Morgan asked the committee to direct staff to revisit the proposal that was shot down by the last council in 2014 . <p> The motion will now be voted on at the next meeting of full City Council . If it 's passed , then city staff will begin their review . <p> Even though councillors voted unanimously in favour of the idea , at least one expressed serious reservations about putting food trucks in drive . <p> Councillor Bill Armstrong said he 'd support the motion , but he wants to ensure the process is done right and that local restaurants are n't undercut . <p> " We have that obligation to those businesses that already have existed , those companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought the market place was about , " he said . " And suddenly we introduce potentially a competitor on public streets .

" We certainly need to create the environment where all business models are successful .

 on Canada Post to Delay End of Door to Door Mail Delivery in London <p> Home mail delivery is scheduled to be phased out in parts of London starting this fall , but if a city committee gets its way , that plan will be delayed . <p> The civic works committee has directed staff to ask Canada Post to delay ending home mail delivery in parts of London until after they 've had a chance to hold public meetings on where the mailboxes should be located and consult with municipalities that have similar concerns . <p> Last November Canada Post revealed 42,433 in London would be the first in the city to make the switch to community mailboxes , the affected postal codes start with N5V , N5W , N5X , and N5Y , as well as N6G and N6H . <p> That includes Londoners in North London as well as Argyle , Riverbend and parts of Oakridge . <p> City staff is currently working with Canada Post on the placement of those mail boxes . <p> No announcements have been made as to when other areas of London will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not receive door-to-door delivery including some new subdivisions in London . <p> While the civic works committee is asking for a delay on the implementation of the community mailboxes , City Councillors in Hamilton are being urged to officially oppose the switch . <p> Aside from the location city staff in Hamilton is concerned about the cost to the city the mailboxes would create , about per box , or million in total . Canada Post has offered Hamilton only to offset those costs . <p> The Crown Corporation has been losing millions of dollars in revenue over the past several years , as email use continues to rise .

 Concern Says EMDC Insider , Ministry Of Corrections <p> A day after concerns were raised about possible tuberculosis exposure at London 's troubled jail , a source from inside the facility tells AM980 that information is completely incorrect . <p> The Elgin Middlesex Detention Centre was locked down on Tuesday after corrections officers began a work refusal . The labour disruption came about after allegations surfaced that inmates had n't been properly screened for tuberculosis since December and there was a risk to the public . That 's despite there having been no suspected cases of the disease at the facility . <p> A fridge in the jail that stored components of standard scratch testing kits had broken down in December and as a result the test could n't be administered to inmates . <p> A correctional officer who works at EMDC told AM980 on Wednesday evening that under Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services ' procedures , all inmates are required to receive a skin test . The only problem is , staff ca n't administer those tests because of the broken fridge . <p> So correctional officers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce facility rules but ultimately unable to do so , the CO told AM980 . <p> But another source from inside EMDC who spoke to AM980 on condition of anonymity , says just because the skin tests are n't being done does n't mean the public , inmates or staff are at risk . <p> They said every inmate is given a detailed physical exam when they enter the facility by registered nurses who check everything from their basic vital signs to whether they show any symptoms of any illnesses . As a part of that process the nurses do a respiratory check , an exam that first started with the spread of SARS over 10 years ago . <p> Anyone who shows signs of illness is put into an isolated wing that has a separate air exchange from the other sections of the jail . Those individuals will then be monitored further , given chest X-rays and whatever treatments they may need . <p> The insider also said that if inmates from other areas of Canada or regions of the world where TB is more common wind up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas to be screened separately . <p> Anyone who refuses to be assessed by the registered nurses is also immediately put into isolation for observation . They 're then monitored for a period of time and if they fail to show any signs of TB or other illnesses , only then are they introduced into general population . <p> The EMDC insider says this form of screening is just as effective as the skin test , especially given the fact that the so-called scratch test can sometimes provide false positives or provoke allergic reactions rather than indicate a TB infection . <p> To say that failing to perform the skin test puts inmates , staff and the public at risk is completely off-base , the insider tells AM980 . They say anyone giving that impression is misinformed <p> It 's a sentiment echoed by the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services . <p> " It is important to note that there have been no suspected cases of active TB identified at EMDC within the last three months , " said Press Secretary for Minister of Community Safety and Correctional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to AM980 on Wednesday . <p> " The initial TB screening is done on admission . This means that if someone is identified as potentially having symptoms of the disease , they are isolated and given an X-ray and then obtain sputum ( phlegm ) samples to confirm the diagnosis , " Callighen wrote . " TB skin tests simply indicate if the inmate has been exposed to the disease or they have received vaccination at some point in their life and therefore have the antibodies . " <p> confirmed that the fridge that stores the tests at EMDC is broken , but said the Ministry is working with local officials to resume skin testing . <p> She also noted EMDC has nursing staff on site around the clock . <p> " The Ministry 's top priority is the health and well-being of both staff and inmates , " Callighen said . <h> Marketplace : A

Operators also would n't be allowed to stay in the same spot for more than 24 hours and would be prohibited from operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the marathon session , the licensing fee would be chopped by more than half thanks to a number of changes to the plan . <p> Councillor Bill Armstrong was by far the most critical of the proposal , citing concerns first over the number of licenses available , the size of the trucks or trailers being used , the total number of spots across the city and the potential for large food chains to capitalize on the opportunity to set up trucks with low overhead costs . <p> He also voiced concerns expressed by business owners in the downtown core who are concerned about the impact the trucks could have on their bottom lines . He said several times that he had serious concerns about the process that was underway . <p> Armstrong said that while he supported the idea of testing out food trucks , he felt eight licenses was too great a number and four would be much safer . He even moved a motion to cut the number which ultimately failed . Following that , he floated a motion calling for six licenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong tried to tighten restrictions surrounding the operation of food trucks , Councillor Virginia Ridley led the charge to loosen the reigns . <p> Ridley put forward three main amendments to the proposal : ditching the requirement for GPS units , scrapping the limit and letting an unlimited number of businesses sign up and getting rid of the 100 m buffer zone around schools . <p> Ridley likened GPS monitoring to the movie Demolition Man where citizens ' actions are constantly monitored and they received fines for improper actions . She said forcing food trucks to report their every move was an example of the government over-reaching . <p> Getting rid of that stipulation would also decrease the food truck licensing fee considerably , she argued . The motion found widespread support with many councillors noting that food trucks advertise where they 'll be on a daily basis so that customers can find them . Surely they said , interactions through social media and log books could effectively prove the trucks were playing by the rules when it comes to operating in the appropriate areas . <p> Councillor Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would impact bylaw enforcement , but city staff said while the technology would be helpful they would still be capable of monitoring food trucks without them . <p> Once all concerns were raised the amendment went to a vote and passed 5-1 . Councillor Armstrong was the only one to vote it down . <p> Ridley 's other proposed amendments did n't receive the same support as neither one even made it to a vote . <p> The other big change to the proposal came from Councillors Mo Salih and Tanya Park . Park raised questions about the number of inspections food trucks would be subject to and city staff said the current proposal called for two per month , at a cost of each . <p> Park wondered if that might be dropped down to one inspection per month and how that would impact the licensing fee . Salih went further still asking staff what the original licensing fee proposed in 2014 of would cover . They replied that it would allow for one inspection a month for eight months as well as other costs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck license in subsequent years would be , a fraction of the being proposed . Salih put forward a motion to change the licensing fee to reflect those original figures and Park seconded it . <p> In his final remarks on the amendment , Salih said City Council should be encouraging businesses to set up in London , not dampen their entrepreneurial spirits with a fee . <p> The committee agreed and passed the amendment by a vote of 5-1 with the committee 's Chair , Councillor Josh Morgan , the only one opposed . <p> Once the proposed changes to the pilot project were decided upon , all that was left to do was approve the amendments as a whole and send the issue on to full City Council for final approval . <p> As councillors prepared to vote , Mayor Matt Brown stressed the importance of getting this project rolling quoting a former employer who once said " done ( was ) better than perfect , " and the good news was that the pilot project was ready to implement . Tweaks , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councillor Jared Zaifman , who sat in on the meeting even though he 's not part of the committee , said if London wants to be known as a city where things happen it was time to get the ball rolling on the project . He stressed the importance of not being the last community to get on board with this initiative and how in the future London should lead the pack when it comes to creative ideas . <p> The final vote of the debate was a unanimous one in favour of sending the pilot project on for final approval . <p> " I think what we saw here this evening was a real success , " Mayor Matt Brown told reporters after the meeting recessed . " It was an extensive discussion , it took just over three hours to come to a conclusion , but that 's more than the last council was able to accomplish in two and a half years . " <p> " There 's a clear direction moving forward , it 's a modest , measured pilot program and we 'll see food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Councillor Bill Armstrong was asked by AM980 after the meeting why he ultimately supported the pilot project if he felt so strongly the plan was flawed . <p> " Well , I did what I could to bring up the concerns that I had . There 's an old saying , ( the ) devil 's in the details , " Armstrong replied . " When we go through , for example , the budget I may have concerns with certain parts of it , but at the end of the day am I going to say absolutely no to the whole budget , vote against it because out of 100 issues I 've got a problem with a couple ? " <p> " I supported food trucks so the answer is yes . Would I like the number lower ? Yes I would . It is where it is , I 'll accept it . " <p> Armstrong said he felt many downtown restaurant owners did n't show up to Wednesday 's meeting to voice their concerns . When reporters asked him why , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Social media is not always kind to people these days , " he said . " I think that there 's some restaurant people who have or might have spoken up ( who ) were concerned that they would be singled out as anti-food trucks . " <p> And while Armstrong said he hopes he 's wrong , he still believes that this initiative wo n't end up looking the way his council colleagues are anticipating . <p> " It may take a pilot project to be done the way they want it for them to see that maybe we did n't quite do our homework enough , that we 've missed a few key points , there 's flaws in the law . " <p> For her part , Councillor Virginia Ridley said she was content with the outcome of Wednesday 's meeting . <p> " I think there 's still room for improvement , there are areas I would have liked to have tackled but I did n't want to cause unnecessary delay , " Ridley told reporters . " I 'm happy to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in the fall if they 're still warranted . " <p> Ridley acknowledged the friction during the debate between some members of the committee , but said at the end of the day everyone still voted to move the pilot project on for final approval . <p> " People want to see change . We recognize that we are a council that was elected to move forward , " Ridley said . <p> " We 're not doing the same old thing , we 're ready to take risks and see progress .

 Hit London Streets As City Council Approves Summer Pilot Project <p> After years of discussions and debate , London City Council has finally approved a food truck pilot project . <p> During Tuesday afternoon 's meeting , councillors voted 15-0 in favour of launching the initiative and getting the mobile eateries up and running on city streets by the summer . <p> Even though the Community and Protective Services Committee meeting hosted a three-hour debate on the plan last week that saw multiple changes made to the proposal , councillors still spoke on the plan for over half an hour . <p> During last week 's meeting , councillors decided to set the licensing fee for each truck at , axing a proposal to require the installation of GPS units to monitor the trucks ' locations . They also set a limit of eight licenses for the 2015 project , but staff will be able to come back and ask City Council to increase that number if demand outweighs the number of available licences . <p> Under the terms of the proposal , food trucks will also be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to maintain a 25 m buffer zone around restaurants , homes and apartments . Operators also wo n't be allowed to stay in the same spot for more than 24 hours and would be prohibited from operating between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m . <p> Councillor Bill Armstrong was the most vocal critic of the plan last week and presented still more questions on Tuesday . They hinged on the automatic renewal of licences between 2015 and 2016 as well as the possibility of requiring the trucks to have wheelchair accessible service windows . <p> " This is a new bylaw and we have an opportunity in this bylaw to create an environment where these new vehicles , which are going to be an investment , could be required to meet reasonable guidelines so that people do n't have to ask for assistance , that they have the ability to come to these vehicles , access the service and it 's accessible .

We 'll see how it goes , " Armstrong said . " I did have some concerns about not knowing where the other locations throughout the city are ... I would have liked to know where else in the community . " <p> Councillor Jesse Helmer also asked about the possibility of amending the bylaw to allow restaurants to opt out of the buffer zone if they wanted to , an idea that was first floated by Councillor Michael van Holst last week . Helmer also wondered if the motion could be amended to allow for food trucks to set up in front of restaurants that are closed . He noted there are some restaurants that do n't open on Sundays and it would n't hurt to allow food trucks to service the community in those locations under those circumstances . <p> Those suggestions would ultimately be put over until this fall 's review of the pilot project as Mayor Matt Brown reminded Helmer that any changes made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee level and be approved again , drawing out the already lengthy process that has been underway for two years . <p> Councillor Virginia Ridley also voiced her encouragement for her colleagues to wrap up the discussion of the issue and make their decision . <p> " I believe that this is a good project . I also believe , and I think it 's clear , that there 's room to grow , " Ridley said stressing the importance of putting the plan in action . " We can and we will review this in the fall . " <p> " There are issues that need to be addressed , but we spent over three hours coming up with the best program that we could launch to get trucks on the street . " <p> Ridley said she appreciated there were some outstanding questions that needed to be answered , but it was time to make a decision . <p> " Let 's move forward with business .

 to Undergo TB Testing After Patient Diagnosed with Drug-Resistant Strain <p> London , Ontario / ( CFPL AM ) AM 980 <p> March 03 , 2015 12:33 pm <p> Tests are being ordered for dozens of people in London for a rare , drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis . <p> Officials with the Middlesex-London Health Unit confirmed to AM980 that as many as 60 Londoners will be tested for the strain after someone at an English-as-a-second language program ( ESL ) next to Banting Secondary School was recently diagnosed . <p> It 's just the third case of its kind in London-Middlesex since 2005 . <p> No one else has shown symptoms at this point , and aside from their home , public health officials say the ESL program was where the patient spent most of their time . <p> Adult students and teachers will be tested during the last week of March to find out if there 's any trace of the bacteria in their bodies . <p> Manager of the MLHU 's Infection Disease Control Team , Tristan Squire-Smith , tells AM980 there 's a specific reason why the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There 's an ideal window , so to speak , of time between after last possible exposure and when it could first be recognized in the body through skin testing that exposure may have happened . That 's what we want to catch . " <p> Squire-Smith says that testing those who could have been exposed to the disease is part of their two-pronged approach to dealing with situations of this nature . The other is making sure the patient who has tested positive is receiving appropriate care . Squire Smith says it 's believed the initial patient in this case is responding well to treatment . <p> In order to protect the person 's privacy , the MLHU has n't disclosed how the student may have contracted tuberculosis , but has said they were a student at the ESL program since September . <p> No one at Banting Secondary School is considered at risk , because the program was run out of a building next door to the high school . <p> " For most of the time , TB is not contagious , " Squire-Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually found as an active disease in the lungs . That 's really when it 's of concern to us on a public health level . " <p> Squire-Smith says in fact , anyone exposed to the disease will actually have TB laying dormant or latent in the body . <p> " It can stay like that for a number of years , in fact for people 's lifetimes if they 're healthy . It 's only when the TB activates and becomes an active , proliferating disease is it of concern to the case , " he says . <p> " It 's really only a matter to notify other people who may have been exposed if the ( patient ) themselves had TB in the lungs . " <p> The contagious variety of TB is typically curable , but those who do n't receive proper treatment can die . <p> Around 10 people are diagnosed with active TB in London and Middlesex County each year , and around half typically have the contagious variety in which bacteria invade the lungs and spreads with coughing .@@3080405 <p> A coroner 's

 Floats Time-Of-Use Bus Pass Plan <p> A rookie London Councillor wants to help low income residents while making better use of the city 's transit system . <p> Ward 1 Councillor Michael van Holst says he 'd like to see the LTC offer bus passes at a reduced rate during off-peak times . The principle is similar to that of Ontario 's Hydro system , where consumers are charged less for using electricity during certain times of the day and week . <p> For van Holst , the idea would help Londoners needing affordable transportation while helping the LTC attract more passengers . <p> " A lot of times during the day you see buses driving around and they 're largely empty , " van Holst tells AM980 . " So essentially we 've got unused capacity on our buses during the off-peak times so perhaps we could sell that at a lower rate . " <p> " It would n't require us to increase the capacity . If we just gave a lot more people bus passes , then we would need more buses to put them on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only good for the off-peak times , then we would n't need a larger capacity but we 'd make better use of the buses . <p> van Holst says he came up with the idea after going through last week 's poverty simulation run by the City of London and Goodwill program Circles .

 On Fate Of Four Heritage Buildings On Former South Street Hospital Lands <p> City council will vote Tuesday on a plan to save three of four heritage buildings on the former South Street hospital lands . <p> The Planning and Environment Committee voted Monday evening to preserve the Colborne Building , the former health services building , and a portion of the War Memorial Hospital . <p> City staff had recommended keeping only two of those buildings but Ward 11 Councillor Stephen Turner believes this is a solid compromise . <p> " I think we spent close to 7 hours in meetings specifically on this file , " he tells AM980 . <p> " The South Street area plan , secondary plan , was designed in consultation with the heritage community and the SoHo community to determine what the next phase is for the lands where the hospital was .

" I thought maybe something was up , and then I went in , asked the salesperson what was going on , that kind of thing . He goes , ' oh , he 's just here signing for a new vehicle ' and I said ' oh , he just parked in a handicapped spot ' and he goes , ' oh , I did n't notice that , ' and that 's when I decided to snap the picture and post it on Facebook . " <p> It was particularly frustrating for Bobby , who notes his grandparents have difficulty walking , and they appreciate having accessible parking readily available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to my Dad about it last night , saying if that was the only handicapped parking spot left , and say for instance my grandparents had to go there , and the next closest spot was 500 yards away and they had to walk and something happened while they were walking to the door , you know , it would have been somebody 's fault . " <p> While London Police are still investigating the photo , London Police Association President Rick Robson says initial findings dispute Bobby 's claims . <p> " I 'd be very , very surprised to learn that a member was there taking care of their own personal business in relation to that type of call . If that 's not the case , I 'm a little disappointed that somebody would put that sort of information out there and not have it be accurate , " says Robson . <p> " From what I understand , the officer was there responding to a call and it seems to be a similar scenario that we had more recently where the markings were n't as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front what I 've seen in the picture I do n't think there was a sign in front . " <p> Back in January , a similar photo was posted online and went viral . It showed a marked London Police cruiser parked illegally in a handicapped space outside Dooly 's Shawarma at Huron St. and Highbury Ave . <p> Following an internal investigation , London Chief Brad Duncan said it was determined that the officer parked in the spot by mistake . <p> In a statement , Duncan said the issue had been " addressed internally . " <p> As for the current situation , Deputy Police Chief John Pare said Thursday afternoon that the investigation is continuing , but it 's unacceptable for their members to park in accessible spots unless it 's an emergency . <p> " Unfortunately it does n't come too long after another incident that came to light , " Pare told AM980 . " As Chief Duncan said at that time , we 're going to look into the matter . We tell our officers not to park in those types of spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement for you to park there . " <p> Whether the officer in this latest case will face a fine , Pare could n't say . <p> " I 'd love to say I was shocked and outraged or surprised , but unfortunately I was n't . I was kind of waiting for this , I kind of assumed it was going to happen again merely because for myself personally this is n't the first time I 've seen it , " he says . <p> Earlier this year , London City Hall raised the cost of tickets for abusing the parking spaces to from , which is London 's most expensive parking infraction . In 2013 , City Hall issued just over 1,300 tickets for accessible parking violations . In 2014 , that number climbed to 1,475 . <p> When asked if he thinks issuing tickets to those who are parked improperly would help change behaviour , Preston says not necessarily . <p> " We 've been ticketing people for years here in London and we still see people parking in wheelchair spots without wheelchair permits or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticketing should n't happen , there should obviously be penalties , but I think what really needs to happen here is increased education , " he says . <p> " People do n't quite understand the importance and the significance of the parking spots , " Preston says . " They think that accessible parking spots are a convenience factor and not an access factor . That they 're not there necessarily because it 's the only way that people can go , they 're there as sort of a courtesy . " <p> " Really what these are about are making places accessible to people who otherwise would not have an opportunity to access the venues . We need to change our thinking about accessibility and accommodation more broadly . " <p> Preston himself uses a wheelchair and his van is equipped with a ramp that needs space to be unloaded . He says there have been times when someone has parked right next to him and he ca n't get in to his vehicle . When that 's happened he 's had to spend hours at a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's owner to return and move it . <p> Preston says while the general public needs to be more aware of these issues , the London Police Service could lead the charge in changing attitudes . <p> " Let 's become champions of this cause and let 's live up to our saying , ' Deeds Not Words .

 of Week-Long OPP Distracted Driving Blitz <p> Ontario Provincial Police are kicking off a week-long distracted driving blitz Saturday with the hope of highlighting the dangers of being inattentive behind the wheel . <p> The blitz , which runs until March 20th , will see officers ramp up patrols over the weekend as many hit the roads for March Break . <p> The start of the campaign comes on the heels of disturbing statistics released last week that indicate 2015 will shape up to be the 7th consecutive year in which distracted driving surpasses impaired driving as a casual factor in fatal collisions on OPP patrolled roads . <p> " Distracted driving is 100 per cent preventable , 100 per cent of the time . This year alone , 12 people have died directly related to distracted driving in 51 fatal crashes that we 've investigated , " explains Western Region OPP Sgt. Dave Rektor . " Those are 12 people who did not need to die . " <p> Provincial Police say in five of those fatal incidents , it was the driver who was found to be driving inattentively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver who died did nothing wrong and was driving properly at the time of the collision . <p> Three of the incidents involved a pedestrian being struck by a vehicle . <p> According to Rektor , hands free Bluetooth devices are not a solution . <p> " While you 're talking your brain is n't concentrating 100 per cent on the road in front of you , the statistics are very clear on that . It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that when the phone 's off , the chances of being distracted are far less . " <p> Rektor says if you 're in a vehicle being driven by someone who is distracted , speak up . <p> " It 's like impaired driving . It became socially unacceptable , and this is now surpassing impaired driving . It too needs to be socially unacceptable and our emphasis is on getting passengers to take a more proactive role in the car to help prevent it . " <p> If you see someone driving in a dangerous manner while driving distracted , call 9-1-1 to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the phone off and throw it in the glove box . I 'd rather put the phone in that box , and prevent you from ending up in a wooden box , " Rektor says . <p> Before Christmas , 
 Service has launched an internal review of its domestic violence policies and how they were applied during a recent child abandonment case that made headlines across the province . <p> The incident in question began in the early morning hours of March 10th when an eight-week-old baby boy was found in his car seat by himself at the base of a driveway on Emery St. East . <p> A neighbour found the child around 5:40 a.m. and called 911 . The baby was examined in hospital and was cleared medically before being placed in the care of the Children 's Aid Society . <p> London Police announced later in the day that the baby 's mother was taken into custody shortly before 2 a.m. in the area of Wellington and Grey Streets .

 Natural Resources is now involved after another bizarre case of coyotes being killed and placed side by side . <p> On Sunday morning , the bodies of two dead coyotes were found metres away from the Thames River upstream from the bridge on University Drive at Western University . In that case , one of the animals was shot and the other appeared to have been killed by a trap . The animals appeared to be deliberately placed side by side . <p> The following day , a Strathroy-area woman out hiking came across the bodies of two coyotes dead , beheaded , and placed side by side just off McGuffin Hills Drive . <p> On Thursday , the Ministry of Natural Resources announced it would be investigating the case in Parkhill . <p> " The one at Western , the Campus Police are leading that , " says Jolanta Kowalski , Senior Media Relations Officer for the Ministry of Natural Resources in Toronto . <p> " But we are aware of it and obviously available to them if needed .

 General Hospital Foundation Teams Up With Tubers For First Of Its Kind Fundraiser <p> It may be the last full day of winter , but officials with the St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital Foundation are already looking forward to February of 2016 . <p> That 's because they 're planning an international event they hope will help raise much needed cash to expand their neo-natal intensive care unit , or NICU . <p> During a morning news conference at STEGH on Thursday , Executive Director of the foundation Paul Jenkins announced plans for the " Take One 4 Our Team " 2016 World Tubing Championships .

" <p> The total cost to refurbish the NICU is an estimated . <p> Jenkins said having a better NICU in St. Thomas will also mean more babies can stay closer to home instead of needing treatment at Victoria Hospital in London .

 to Vote on Future of Storybook Gardens ' Animal Barn <p> Nearly two months after the historic animal barn at Storybook Gardens burned to the ground , a proposal to do away with the attraction will be up for a vote at London City Hall . <p> On Tuesday , members of the Community and Protective Services Committee will get their first look at a staff recommendation to put an end to the only remaining animal attraction . <p> Old McDonald 's barn had been part of Storybook since it opened in 1958 , but was destroyed by a fire on February 3rd , the cause of which is undetermined . <p> It 's expected the city will receive approximately in insurance money . <p> The proposal to use the money elsewhere was brought forward , in part , due to a recent survey which suggested only five out of 3,500 people included the animals as a reason for visiting Storybook Gardens . <p> As well , most people only spend on average between 5 and 7 minutes visiting the animals before moving on . <p> " If the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really does n't fit that many people flowing through it either , " says Ward 7 Councillor Josh Morgan . " With that barn not there , I think what you 're seeing is the opportunity to see the hillside and to start to envision what could be in that space , and not necessarily what was in that space . " <p> It remains to be seen what would replace the old barn , though . <p> Even with no concrete options on the table , Councillor Morgan tells AM980 there 's lots of potential . <p> " And really that 's what staff is asking is not to rebuild something substantial right away , but let 's try a couple of different things on that space and see what people like .

 for Both of London 's Deputy Mayors <p> London , Ontario / ( CFPL AM ) AM 980 <p> March 31 , 2015 07:01 am <p> There may be a generous pay hike on the horizon for London 's two Deputy Mayors . <p> The motion to review the salaries of Ward 8 Councillor Paul Hubert and Ward 5 Councillor Maureen Cassidy was moved unexpectedly Monday night at the ' governance working group ' by Ward 12 Councillor Harold Usher . <p> At the moment , Hubert and Cassidy earn the same salary as the 12 other members of Council , a taxable equivalent of . <p> The motion to review their salaries was supported by Mayor Matt Brown , but no decisions were made on Monday . <p> Instead , the issue was deferred and will be further discussed at a standing committee meeting in two weeks . <p> There 's been no firm recommendation made on how much extra salary should be paid to both Deputy Mayors , although a report in 2010 suggested the position was worth a 69 per cent increase from their current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the salary of the Deputy Mayors , but rather than looking at that initial recommendation he suggested using the actual salary of the city 's last deputy as an example . The position was last held in 2010 by the late Tom Gosnell . At the time , the position paid about more than the position of Councillor . <p> Speaking with AM980 on Tuesday morning , Councillor and Deputy Mayor Paul Hubert expressed concern about City Council voting on its own pay increases and suggested they reconsider the recommendations tabled in 2013 during the last council term by the Council Compensation Review Task Force . It was a report that was voted down by the previous Council . <p> " Unfortunately the former council did not accept the recommendations of that compensation task force and so now once again every year as per our procedural bylaw , our remuneration has to be debated on the floor of council . So the question of , whether it should or should not is somewhat moot at this point .

" And it 's not just workload , it 's responsibilities because we have added responsibilities if anything happens to the Mayor then one of us steps in and there is a chain of command . Again , I do n't think it ever hurts to have a conversation to see if we can approve it . " <p> " I did n't go into that role in order to make more money .

As a result , he missed submission deadline and now wo n't be eligible to run in the next election 2018 . <p> There 's been radio silence from Cheng in the five months since October 's election .

From what I can see , the focus is not on running the city better , but it 's to make sure any potential candidate or challenger is killed off before the process even starts four years from now , " he said . <p> When questioned if he believed the rejection of his documents was politically motivated , Cheng said he did n't know for sure but City of London by-laws are n't always enforced across the board and there 's selective enforcement . <p> " The leadership could have said , ' Let 's go into the 21st century . We accept electronic signature like every other modern city and every other business in the world .

 To " Voluntarily " Refund Sabbatical Payout , Review Launched of Compensation Practices <p> After almost a week of intense public scrutiny and anger over a whopping salary payout , Western University 's President says he will voluntarily repay the cash he received for working through a scheduled sabbatical . <p> Amit Chakma says he will also waive a similar payout option in his current contract . <p> Just moments before 6 p.m . Wednesday , officials with Western University issued a pair of statements . The first said the institution 's Board of Governors had launched a review of their presidential compensation process to be led by former Justice of the Court of Appeal of Ontario the Honorable Stephen T. Goudge . <p> The second statement was from President Amit Chakma himself and reads as follows : <p> April 1 , 2015 <p> Dear Colleagues and members of the broader Western University community : <p> My employment contract with Western , executed in 2009 , provided for payment in lieu of one year of administrative leave at the end of my five-year term . When I was reappointed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the administrative leave . <p> Although contractually sanctioned , in hindsight , I should have carried over my administrative leave to the end of my current term . <p> Today , Western 's Board of Governors retained the Honourable Stephen T. Goudge to conduct an independent and impartial review of my compensation . I am confident that Justice Goudge will complete a full and fair examination and I will whole heartedly cooperate . I look forward to his findings and intend to abide by his recommendations . <p> In the interim , as a demonstration of my commitment to Western and to address the concerns that many have expressed , I have decided voluntarily to refund the in lieu payment to the University . I have also decided not to exercise my right under the contract to receive payment in lieu of administrative leave at the end of my second term . <p> I hope the above actions will allow us to move forward . <p> The release of the 2014 Sunshine List last Friday revealed Chakma made including taxable benefits last year . His usual annual salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned administrative sabbatical at the end of his first presidential term , he received a lump sum payment of his salary instead . <p> His newly signed contract , which runs until 2019 , holds the same provision . <p> The news of the dollar payout caused an outcry from Western students , faculty and members of the general public . The statement issued by Western 's Board of Governors acknowledged the public concern saying there had been " been significant attention " surrounding Chakma 's compensation . <p> The board 's Chair , Chirag Shah , was quoted as saying the board is " highly sensitive to the concerns expressed by members of the Western community and the wider public . " <p> Shah said this is especially the case given the current fiscal uncertainty and restraint in the post-secondary education sector . <p> " Accordingly , we have asked former Court of Appeal Justice Stephen T. Goudge to conduct a full , fair , and transparent review of the issue , " Shah said in the statement . <p> Despite the launch of the review Shah said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his contracts . <p> " The Board maintains Dr. Chakma 's contract was negotiated in good faith in the spring of 2009 to provide a competitive compensation package in line with peer institutions . Nonetheless , the Board is committed to implementing the recommendations that come forward from Justice Goudge , " Shah said . <p> " The Board has every confidence in the leadership of Dr. Chakma . His leadership is internationally recognized , " Shah said going on to list the ways they feel the embattled president has enhanced the university 's reputation . <p> The Board of Governors listed the following as Chakma 's accomplishments : <p> Implementing a new strategic plan ' Achieving Excellence on the World Stage ' that maps out an ambitious plan for the future <p> Achieving one of the highest student retention rates and graduation rates in Canada , as well as a 94 per cent employment rate within two-years after graduation <p> Surpassing international enrollment targets to more than 10 per cent of the undergraduate student population <p> Attracting more than million in research funding annually . <p> Raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has raised million in student awards . <p> The statement concluded by saying the Board of Governors is " keenly aware of the financial sacrifices that many students make in order to attend Western and expresses a deep appreciation of the dedicated faculty and staff who are dedicated to providing the very best in teaching and research , as well as to alumni for their support . " The board said that it 's committed to ensuring the " swift resolution " of the review , but wo n't be commenting further on the matter until its completion . <p> It turns out Chakma got an even bigger payout in 2009 after leaving a vice-president position at the University of Waterloo to take the job at Western . He received in salary and benefits , which is the highest amount among academics in Ontario . <p> And while Western officials wo n't offer up any more statements on the matter , the same ca n't be said for politicians at Queen 's Park . <p> New Democrat MPP for London West , Peggy Sattler , will hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabling of a Private Member 's Bill that would ban double salary payouts for senior executives at post-secondary institutions . <p> The President of Western University 's Faculty Association , Allison Hearn , as well as the President of the Canadian Federation of Students Ontario , Alastair Woods will join Sattler during her 9 a.m. media conference at Queen 's Park . <p> Hearn does n't think Chakma 's decision to repay some of the salary is enough . She feels the board refuses to take responsibility for the excessive pay at a time when cuts were being made to student education across campus . <p> When asked what she thought of Chakma 's decision to repay his sabbatical payout , Sattler said this issue goes beyond Chakma and Western . <p> " To me , there is a systemic problem when we have this carte blanche ability for university boards of governors to negotiate these kinds of packages , " Sattler told AM980 on Wednesday evening . <p> With that being said , Sattler does feel the independent review of Chakma 's compensation is a good first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held to account for the compensation practices that they engage in .

I think that would be good for the City . The loss of those jobs from Kellogg 's was a significant blow to many people who are living in the City . So on that side , in terms of economic impact , it could be quite significant . " <p> Helmer said having a company move back into the building would also give a nice boost to the tax base as the City losses between 30 and 35 per cent of the taxes for vacant buildings . <p> When it comes to getting a new firm set up on the site , Helmer said the sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what comes forward from the private sector and what 's happening in terms of the interest in that property , " he said .

 Orchestra London may have another shot at securing financial support if a new plan gains traction at City Hall . <p> In a report set to be tabled at Monday 's meeting of the Strategic Priorities and Policy Committee , City Manager Art Zuidema recommends be allotted to the London Arts Council 's Board of Governors to source out ways to reconfigure the structure of the orchestra which floundered in December of 2014 . <p> The report says should be used with the goal of creating " a new professional financially sustainable orchestral model that would be successful for London .

It would also be entrusted with providing office infrastructure and support for the Musicians of Orchestra London , the name adopted by the artists left without an organization after the orchestra 's stunning implosion . <p> The other would be poured into the immediate creation of a " We Play On Performance Fund " to help the musicians earn a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the cash would come from , the report says it would be allocated through the Community Arts Investment Program . <p> LAC 's Board of Governors would be asked to provide the city manager and treasurer with quarterly updates on the progress of the report on how best to revamp Orchestra London 's model .

" It 's heartening to see that the city values us .

 Understanding of Human Brain <p> A Western University study suggests it 's time to " rethink " our understanding of how the brain works , research touted as having implications on future study of brain development and diseases . <p> According to the research , despite the prevailing assumption by neuroscientists , the human brain is not " hardwired " to tackle problems and undertake certain actions in a way that is consistent between different people . Quite the contrary , in fact . <p> J. Bruce Morton , PhD , professor in Western 's psychology department and faculty member of the neuroscience graduate programme , authored the study , which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience , a weekly peer-reviewed journal published by the Washington , DC-based Society for Neuroscience . <p> " Conventional thinking views the brain like a road map of a city , " said Morton , in a Western University release . " Different destinations are the regions of the brain and the roads would be brain pathways that connect them together to share information . Now imagine taking long time-lapse photos of major roadways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like the rush-hour traffic that changes directions at the end of the workday or the decrease in volume during the weekends . We do the same thing in most brain studies and this has led to the idea that activity is hardwired . <p> " We now have the ability to see when the brain has a ' traffic jam ' and this could be the critical link in proving individually tailored treatment options to a variety of mental illnesses ranging from ADHD to schizophrenia . " <p> The research was done by asking 51 individuals from nine to 34 years of age to perform a variety of tasks while researchers scanned their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technology . Morton said that this showed the active parts of the brain to be constantly in motion , as opposed to merely " on or off . " <p> A statement from Western puts this in context . <p> " By viewing the brain like a movie instead of a photo , Morton 's research shows that what actually happens in the human brain is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also within the same individual , " the statement reads . " Each time our brain is presented with a task , we shift the patterns of working regions in real time continuously drawing on different sets of brain areas . The types of patterns were related to the age of the subject , possibly explaining why adults perform tasks differently than children especially tasks related to controlling behaviour . " <p> Morton and his team are planning on parlaying these findings into future research . <p> " Discovering that the brain 's function is much more variable , evolving , and dynamic than we previously thought has far-reaching implications , " says Morton .

 the London Police Association is responding to the results of a three year pilot project for body worn cameras in Edmonton . <p> While Rick Robson was expecting results surrounding the cost of the program , he was surprised to find that the cameras did n't result in a reduction of use of force or citizen complaints . <p> " Giving the nature of some of the interactions we have with people and from experience , " begins Robson , " some people do n't really seem to care that the police are discussing a situation with them or that they 're on video and they 'll carry on as they do business but the fact that it was just as likely to escalate as deescalate was surprising . " <p> The report argues claims body-worn cameras reduce aggression and rudeness and promote citizen compliance are based on " extrapolations from social theory " rather than specific research . <p> The data gathered in the project painted a complex picture , showing that body-worn cameras were just as likely to have a negative impact on a situation as a positive impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how people react depends on the context and situation . <p> " A high level of intoxication or a mental health issue , it makes no difference at all .

" <p> Overall , Robson says Edmonton 's pilot project has reaffirmed his position on body-worn cameras . <p> " I think it supports what I think the biggest outcome from this initiative is that they 're expensive , they cost a lot of money , and we really have to do a cost-benefit analysis of is it worth the investment that we have for what we 're going to take away for body-worn cameras .

 the victim of a deadly shooting early Sunday was a member of the Gate Keepers , a support club for the Hells Angels . <p> 49-year-old Steve Sinclair ( pictured ) described by those who knew him as a devoted partner , loving father , and loyal friend died in hospital on Sunday , not long after he was shot outside a small club he 'd been operating for the past two years on Hamilton Road , near Gore Road . <p> The club was often frequented by others linked to outlaw motorcycle clubs . <p> As of Tuesday afternoon , Police had yet to apprehend a suspect in connection with London 's sixth homicide of the year , leading to concern from a leading biker expert . <p> " The potential for escalation is huge right now , " said Yves Lavigne who 's written several books about the Hells Angels , and has numerous biker sources . <p> " If this violence continues , then the Hells Angels have to react to this killing . If they do n't , then who will want to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go to bat for them afterwards , people wo n't work for them . " he said . <p> The Gate Keepers have at least two chapters in southern Ontario , four chapters in Nova Scotia , and " do as directed by the Hells Angels , " biker experts say . The support club is used to insulate Hells Angels members from criminal activity or prosecution , often by " taking the fall or doing things for them to make them money , " according to the OPP 's biker enforcement unit . <p> London Police said Tuesday they 've yet to establish a motive for Sunday 's shooting , and refused to say whether it was linked to biker or gang activity . <p> Still , they share Lavigne 's concerns about possible retaliation . <p> " We 're always concerned about further violence , and we put measures in place to mitigate that as best we can . " said Detective Inspector Kevin Heslop with the London Police Service . <p> " We monitor outlaw motorcycle gangs on a routine basis in a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a unit here in London consisting of members of the OPP , London Police , and the RCMP .

" But I think the Angels realized they needed to have a show of force , which is also a show of respect for the deceased , but also a show of force for the people who killed him . " <p> A search for the individual who pulled the trigger continued Tuesday with very little in the way of specifics . <p> The suspect is described only as a black male , aged 18 to 22 years old , approximately 5 ' 8 to 5 ' 11 , with a slim build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recovered , and the suspect who remains at large " may be armed , " Police said . <p> Officers initially arrested five people at the scene , but it was later determined none of them had anything to do with the shooting .

Police later said the violence was related to a turf war involving the illegal drug trade in London between the Hells Angels , and various street gangs . <p> There 's been relatively little in the way of activity since . <p> " They like to fly under the radar the more Police attention they draw , the more charges are laid , more people are locked up , and that interrupts their business , so that 's primarily why they 're laying low , " said Detective Inspector Heslop. <p> A candlelight service

 a terminally i 'll cancer patient is speaking out the day after his father 's body was found by police , not far from the London Health Sciences Centre where he 'd been reported missing . <p> 68-year-old Frederick Sutherland ( pictured ) was last seen alive just before 1 a.m .

" <p> His body was found around 4 p.m . Thursday in a wooded area on the north side of Commissioners Road East just west of the CN railway tracks . An autopsy was performed Friday and the deceased has been identified as Sutherland . Foul play is not suspected in relation to his death , according to police . <p> " It 's unfathomable to me , I 'm flabbergasted .

Doctors discovered recently that the cancer had returned , however , and Sutherland was admitted to LHSC for treatment approximately two weeks ago . <p> " He probably knew he was dying , and did n't want to die in the hospital . " said Fisher when trying to understand why his father left the hospital on his own accord in the middle of the night , without being discharged , and with no one waiting to pick him up . <p> " If he knew he was dying , which he was , he wanted to go and be with someone he was familiar with , and he knew .

 Poverty Panel Criticized for Lack of Diversity <p> London , Ontario / ( CFPL AM ) AM 980 <p> September 22 , 2015 07:49 am <p> Questions are being raised about the make-up of London Mayor Matt Brown 's high-profile advisory panel on poverty . <p> The seven person group was unveiled at a news conference last week by Brown , but some have questioned why it does n't include anyone currently living in poverty , nor any representatives from groups disproportionately impacted by poverty . <p> In a report being delivered to city politicians on Tuesday afternoon , London 's Diversity and Race Relations Advisory Committee will formally request the mayor consider the possibility of adding at least one member to the panel to better represent London 's cultural diversity . <p> Chad Callander is the chair of the committee , and tells AM980 they want more voices around the table . <p> " They 're certainly going to go out and consult the public but one thing I think you have to consider is that of Londoners consider themselves to be a visible minority and there 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , from what I 'm aware , on the committee itself .

 councillor Michael van Holst is doubling down on comments he made during a City Council meeting on Tuesday describing the threat of climate change as " ridiculously exaggerated .

He added that any concerns about the threat of global warming should be taken with a grain of salt . <p> " The threat of climate change has been ridiculously exaggerated , " he said at Tuesday 's meeting . " When we hear these exaggerated concerns we should just ignore it , take them with a grain of salt . We can deal with this issue fairly easily .

" <p> Van Holst 's comment was met with silence by his council colleagues who essentially ignored him and voted to join the group . <p> In an interview Wednesday on AM980 's The Pulse with Devon Peacock , which can be listened to in full below , van Holst said he stood by his controversial comments . <p> " I was at the Clean Air Summit in Toronto recently , and I head the Minister of the Environment Glen Murray speak , and I 've heard him speak three times this year in person . And every time , the pronouncement got worse . And , this time , because we 're burning fossil fuels , there was the ' threat of biospheric destruction . We 're talking about the survival of the planet . ' Those were the things that I thought were extremely exaggerated , that 's just going a little too far . " <p> " So is it that you disbelieve , I guess , the threat of it is exaggerated , or do you have reservations about human-contributed climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think my point is that the threat is being exaggerated , " he replied . " When I look at the United Nations , kind of like a water purifier salesmen . If you have someone come in and sell you a water purifier , they 're going to exaggerate the threat . They 'll tell you it 's going to affect your grandchildren , and tell you that you have to ' act now ! ' and in the end a bunch of money is going to pass through their hands , and so , that 's kind of what we 're dealing with . " <p> Asked whether he believed climate change posed a threat to humans , van Holst replied " well climate 's always posed a threat , right ? But the nice thing is that adapting to the climate is what humans do best . The fact the climate is changing does n't really bother me . I 'm just concerned about someone exaggerating that for their own gain , and frightening people , frankly . I think they 're becoming frightened about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " <p> The idea of destroying the biosphere , or saying the survival of the planet was in question " sounds really foolish " and is alarmist , he said , as the carbon cycle dictates that carbon dioxide caused by burning fossil fuels will eventually be absorbed as biomass into the planet in the form of forests , food , and fish . <p> " That 's not a bad thing , " he said . " We may get a bit of a rainy season in the meantime , that 's what the scientists are telling us , that 's certainly something we can get over . And there 's only 100 years worth of fossil fuels available , so in terms of planet Earth , this is a little hiccup , right ? We 'll burn the fossil fuel , it 'll become carbon dioxide , it 'll become plants again , and then it 'll be pretty much back to normal .

Hollande called the carnage " an act of war that was prepared , organized , planned from abroad with internal help . " <p> The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attacks . An online statement appeared in Arabic and French and was circulated by IS supporters . It was not immediately possible to confirm the authenticity of the admission , which showed the group 's logo and resembled previous verified statements from the group .

Police have said that a Syrian passport was recovered from the remains of one suicide bomber outside the stadium . <p> Authorities said eight suspects died , seven in suicide bombings . Police said they shot and killed the other assailant . <p> French officials have identified one of the seven assailants responsible as Ismael Omar Mostefai , a 29-year old French citizen who was flagged by authorities five years ago for having links to Islamic radicals . <p> Three of the seven suicide bombers killed were French citizens , as was at least one of the seven other people arrested in neighbouring Belgium suspected of links to the attacks . <p> French Prosecutor 's office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said authorities could n't rule out the possibility that other militants involved in the attack remained at large . <p> The militants launched at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminate civilian targets . <p> Three suicide bombs targeted spots around the national Stade de France stadium , north of the capital , where Hollande was watching an exhibition soccer match .

At least 37 people were killed , according to Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins . <p> Charlotte Brehaut , a reporter , was at the cafe and says it started out like any other Friday night . <p> " The next thing we knew there were huge explosions , it sounded like fireworks . Then we all hit the floor immediately with shards of glass coming in and we laid on the floor for something like a minute while we heard what sounded like them reloading guns , " she said . " I lay on the floor and grabbed hold of a woman next to me . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK , and I looked up and I realized that she 'd been shot in the chest and she was dying . She had a pool of blood around her . " <p> Attackers also stormed the Bataclan concert hall , which was hosting the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal . They opened fire on the panicked audience and took members hostage . As police closed in , three detonated explosive belts , killing themselves , according to Paris police chief Michel Cadot . <p> Imen Ahmed was at a bar near the Bataclan with her mother when the shots rang out . <p> " The shooting started so we went to the bar and just hid . People were running everywhere and they were like , ' OK , we need to move , we need to hide . ' So I took my mother 's hand and just hid under the table .

He said police and military reinforcements would be deployed to key public buildings . <p> Security concerns are also mounting in advance of the climate summit taking place in Paris at the end of the month . <p> French officials have said the meetings will go ahead with tight security . <p> Meanwhile , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has arrived at the G20 summit in Turkey where Friday 's attacks will likely dominate the discussions . <p> Trudeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , CSIS , on Friday night . <p> Just before boarding his plane Friday , Trudeau offered " all of Canada 's support " to France , adding " Our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to our French cousins in this dark and terrible time .

He was asked whether Friday 's events in Paris would cause him to alter his plans to repeal some aspects of Bill C-51 and end Canada 's involvement in airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State targets . <p> Trudeau sidestepped the question . <p> " It 's too soon to jump to any conclusions , but obviously governments have a responsibility to keep their citizens safe while defending our rights and freedoms and that balance is something that the Canadian government , and indeed all governments around the world , will be focusing on , " the prime minister said also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . <p> Meanwhile , other world leaders are also condemning the attacks .

 To Address Future of Parking in the New Year <p> The future of overnight parking in London is a big ticket item on the agenda for London 's civic works committee . At the committee 's next meeting , councillors will decide whether to continue free overnight parking or kick it to the curb . The discussion comes following a report on the free overnight parking pilot project that ran from the May long weekend to Nov. 1 . Approximately 11,000 motorists took advantage of the project , which the report estimated resulted in in lost parking ticket revenue . <p> Among the alternatives considered in the report is the creation of a paid permit parking system , with a select number of available permits . <p> " I think it was really successful . We had quite a few people sending me messages throughout saying how thankful they were for it because it allowed them an opportunity they did n't have before , " Coun. Jared of Ward 14 said . " They did n't have to worry about where their car had to be parked , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things a little easier for them as well as visitors to the city . " <p> said complaints regarding the free overnight parking were few and far between . However , according to the committee 's report , parking enforcement officials received a substantial number of complaints following Labour Day regarding an increased volume of street parking , in some cases causing potential safety concerns for emergency responders due to road width restrictions . As for the ability of the city to recoup lost revenue , Zaifman said they are looking at different models . <p> " When we look at revenue I think it 's sort of a misnomer that we look at parking ticket revenue as a way that the city should be making money , but yes it is something that we have to figure a way to get back , " he said .

 Living Wage London Project on Friday <p> We 'll find out on Friday morning the amount of money local community and business leaders think it takes for an average family to get by residing in London . <p> The Living Wage London project will be officially unveiled at a news conference , where officials will also launch a new website encouraging local employers to sign up for the voluntary program . <p> It certainly wo n't help a family bankroll lavish vacations or fancy cars , but local Medical Officer of Health Dr Chris Mackie said the living wage provides a basic level of economic security . <p> " Minimum wage is set at the provincial level and it is a mandatory floor , " said Dr. Mackie . " Living Wage is really a calculation that communities can use as an aspirational goal and says that , you know , for our community you need to be making this amount per hour or per year to really be able to participate and have a decent quality of life . " <p> Dr. Mackie noted the significant impact the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Income is one of the most , if not the most important driver of health , " he said .

" <p> According to the Living Wage Canada website , " a living wage reflects what earners in a family need to bring home based on the actual costs of living in a specific community . The living wage is a call to private and public sector employers to pay wages to both direct and contract employees that are sufficient to provide the basics to families with children . <p> The living wage is calculated as the hourly rate at which a household can meet its basic needs , once government transfers have been added to the family 's income and deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of severe financial stress by lifting them out of poverty and providing a basic level of economic security . " <p> London 's figure will be based on a two-income household with two children aged eight and four , adjusted to account for local factors like housing costs and food prices . <p> Back in February , the Board of the Middlesex London Health Unit pledged to pay all contract workers a living wage that officials calculated to be roughly an hour in the region . <p> Health unit employees were already offered that but their contract workers , including cleaning and security staff , were not always making a living wage . <p> The fact that the Health Unit was already supportive of the idea came as no surprise to Mike Moffatt , Assistant Professor of Business , Economics and Public Policy at the Ivey Business School . <p> " I think we 'll find once we release this figure that a lot of employers in London are already living wage employers and do n't even realize it , " Moffatt said .

 Commerce Calling for Cap and Trade Billing Transparency <p> When Ontario ramps up it 's cap and trade program to curb pollution , business and residential power customers wo n't really know what the impact will be on their utility bills . <p> The Ontario Energy Board is being accused of a lack of transparency by allowing for the individual cost of the cap and trade program to fall under the delivery line item on hydro and natural gas bills , instead of having its own separate listing . <p> Ontario will join Quebec and California 's market next January , mandating pollution limits on companies but allowing them to buy emission credits or sell them to others if they are under their quota . <p> London Chamber of Commerce CEO Gerry Macartney said they want a more transparent process . <p> " That line of sight that we need to have on our bills is really the encouragement we need to make cap and trade work , " he said .

 Western In Yates Cup <p> Any championship game tends to have its superhero . The player who makes the difference that wins the game . <p> In the fourth quarter of the 109th Yates Cup on Saturday afternoon , the Laurier Golden Hawks came at the Western Mustangs like an entire collection of superheroes , erased a 21 point deficit and then kicked the game winning field goal with no time remaining for a 43-40 victory and a berth in the Uteck Bowl next week . <p> The Mustangs alternated between Clark Kent and Superman all day long , but ahead 40-19 in the fourth quarter , they could not find their way to a phone booth to pull on the cape a final time and hang on . <p> The first quarter even included an element of comic book creativity . There was trickery and there was disguise , courtesy of an on-side kick , a fake field goal and a fake punt , all in the first twelve minutes . Western 's onside kick worked to perfection and set up a field goal to put them ahead 10-0 before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had the coaches digging deeper into their bags of tricks . But , after the fake field goal and punt came off about as effectively as a Greatest American Hero landing , the deception died down and the game was gathered back into the hands of the men of steel . <p> Stevenson Bone was called down on the snap of the fake field goal when it was ruled his knee was on the ground . Laurier 's fake punt went for virtually no gain after it turned into a broken play . <p> Western 's 10-0 lead came courtesy of an opening drive touchdown from running back Alex Taylor and a 28-yard field goal by Mark Liegghio . <p> The Golden Hawks dented into the Mustang lead with the first of four field goals off the foot of Nathan Mesher , just over six minutes into the first quarter , but Western bounced right back with a 19-yarder from Liegghio and the lead was ten again . <p> Despite the points , the Mustangs never seemed to tilt momentum their way on the field and the Golden Hawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field goal was followed quickly by a long pass deep into Mustang territory and a 43-yard run by Levondre Gordon for a Laurier touchdown . <p> That score seemed to knocked Western temporarily out of sync . Laurier continued to get the proverbial bounces and the actual ones , too . Right before the second of two field goals to end the first half , Golden Hawks ' quarterback Chris Knevel was pushed back and fumbled the ball , only to have it nose into the turf and bounce right back into his body , taking the teams to the locker rooms with Laurier leading 19-13 . <p> Western looked a little more the part of a caped crusader to kick off the second half as a solid defensive stop led to a punt and a quick strike on offense as George Johnson caught a pass and split through the Golden Hawks defense for 39 yards and a Western lead of 20-19 , just 2:02 in . <p> Laurier roared down into Western territory , but Carson Ouelette coughed up the ball after making a catch , and Western 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if were catching some sort of villainous explosive before it hit the ground . Beaulieu kind of has a knack for plays like that . He was the guy who ripped the ball out of the hands of a Guelph ball carrier in the regular season , and ran it down the field for a touchdown . Beaulieu capped off his TD that day by spiking a pilon in the end zone . <p> Four plays later , the turnover was in the end zone as Chris Merchant hooked up with George Johnson on a 39-yard pas play that saw Johnson slice right up the middle of the defense . <p> Western 's defense continued to play strong and the offense continued to move the ball . <p> Alex Taylor completed a drive that began on the Mustang 15 with a 13-yard run for a touchdown .

 Streak Hits Four <p> The North Bay Battalion 's Brent Moran kicks a shot out past the Knights ' Victor Mete during Friday 's game at Budweiser Gardens ( Claus Andersen/Getty Images ) <p> The London Knights sandwiched three North Bay goals with eight of their own , extending their winning streak with an 8-3 victory on Friday at Budweiser Gardens . London has now won four straight games as they head into an uphill climb in their schedule with six games in just nine days . <p> There was no sign of incline in the first period as the Knights got rolling downhill , scoring three times to lead 3-0 . <p> Alex Formenton helped to open the scoring as he used speed to beat out an icing , got a shot on goal and Owen MacDonald put home the rebound for a 1-0 lead .

Justin Brazeau skated down the right wing and sent a knuckler of a shot over the glove of Tyler Parsons to score North Bay 's first goal against London this season . The Knights shut out the Battalion 7-0 in North Bay on November 3rd . That made the score 3-1 and changed the flow of the game for much of the middle period . <p> The teams began to race back and forth up and down the ice .

He cut hard to the net and poked a shot through Moran for his team-leading 14th goal of the season at 47 seconds . <p> Robby Thomas battled the puck to the North Bay net and then banged in a rebound for a 7-3 London lead . <p> Pu finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team goal scoring lead with Miletic as he snapped a shot through the legs of Moran . <p> Five London players recorded multi-point games .

 <h> Citi Plaza Snafu <p> A plan by London City Council to save taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars may end up having the opposite effect . <p> Council decided last July to move the Parks and Recreation , Social Services and Neighbourhood Services offices out of the Market Tower and into the Citi Plaza .

However , if that time schedule is to be met it would likely require hours of costly overtime by sub-contractors . <p> City hall 's plan was to consolidate the three offices , which are spread out on different floors within the Market Tower building into one location on the second floor of Citi Plaza . City officials estimated the move will provide a cost-savings of ' hundreds of thousands of dollars ' over the five-year lease term . <p> The Ombudsman 's investigation is the result of a complaint that the meeting violated the open meeting requirements of the Municipal Act .

 <h> A Shutout Win To End The Weekend <p> Two goals by Mitchell Stephens and 37 saves from Tyler Parsons helped the London Knights blank the Generals 4-0 in Oshawa on Sunday night . <p> The win moved the Knights back into a tie for first overall with the Erie Otters after the team fought through injuries and the flu to nab two victories in three games . Both clubs have 21 games remaining . <p> London almost picked up at least 5 points . The winning goal in their game against the Otters on Friday night deflected off the stick of Dylan Strome with 40.4 seconds remaining . <p> Adding in Saturday 's 7-6 comeback in Owen Sound , Stephens scored five times and netted a shootout winner . After playing all his OHL career with the Saginaw Spirit , he is beginning to feel very comfortable in London . <p> " The confidence and the chemistry that I 've had with J.J. ( Piccinich ) and ( Dante Salituro ) has been great ... and the team is playing well and winning hockey games and that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephens ' second goal that characterized leading by example . At the end of a long shift , the New Jersey native willed his legs to give anything they had left and jumped up to create a 2-on-1 . Stephens fed Piccinich and the Knights ' captain feathered a return pass back , allowing Stephens to slice the puck over Kyle Keyser and into the Oshawa net . <p> Piccinich and Stephens combined on the fourth London goal as Stephens left the penalty box and took a pass from Piccinich that put him 1-on-1 at the Generals ' blue line . Stephens moved to his right and ripped a wrister over the glove of Keyser for his seventh point of the weekend . <p> Janne Kuokkanen 's 19th goal of the season opened the scoring in the first period and it held for almost two periods . Alex Turko knocked a puck loose out of a faceoff scrum and Kuokkanen wristed it in to make it 1-0 London . It was Turko 's first OHL point after starting the year with the St. Thomas Stars . <p> Evan Bouchard scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right circle in the third period . <p> The shutout by Parsons was his third of the year . He used arms , legs , sticks and even his face to make saves , taking a blast square off his mask in period three . The mask came away O.K. and Parsons was still smiling about it after the game . <p> " It 's one of those things where sometimes that hurts and sometimes it does n't . This time was all right and it was definitely a good night . " <p> Parsons faced a lot of hard shots , especially from the Generals ' defence core who would give anybody a run when it comes to getting power behind the puck . The Chesterfield , Michigan native now has seven career shutouts and used this one to raise his save percentage to .925 . <p> Mitch Vande Sompel had to go through the strange experience of facing teammates he won a Memorial Cup with less than two years ago . <p> " It was weird . Those are the guys I 've been passing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it was good to get the win . " <p> After playing without eight regulars on Saturday afternoon in Owen Sound , London got some reinforcements in Oshawa . Max Jones , Sam Miletic and Cliff Pu returned to the lineup and played much of the game on the same line . <p> The Knights get two days to rest up and then they host the Kitchener Rangers at Budweiser Gardens on Wednesday at 7:00 . Broadcast time on AM 980 will be 6:30. 
 <h> City Politicians Pitch Liaison Committee to Repair Relationship with London Police <p> A pair of city politicians have an idea they hope will mend the strained relationship between Council and London Police . <p> Mayor Matt Brown and Councillor Stephen Turner want to create a new city committee specifically designed to bring both sides together following a tense , year-long budget dispute . <p> Outgoing Police Services Board Budget Chief Paul Paolatto publicly criticized Council on January 19th , calling their lack of response to a letter sent last year by the London Police Association " disrespectful . " <p> accused Mayor Brown of impeding a budget compromise drafted last February that would have saved taxpayers $1 million compared to the deal reached in November . <p> The Mayor has denied that he kept the compromise from reaching Council , but in their motion Brown and Turner admit that " organizations , like people , are not perfect . " <p> The motion is posted below : <p> Chair and Members <p> Strategic Priorities and Policy Committee <p> Re : Request for London Police Services/City of London Liaison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the London Police Services Board have committed to rebuilding the working relationship between our two organizations . Organizations , like people , are not perfect , but if we can take what we have learned from our recent budget experience and use that to move forward in a positive way , both of our organizations can be more successful in protecting and serving the citizens of London within the scope of each of our mandates . <p> We would therefore respectfully request " That the London Police Services Board BE INVITED to consider assigning the Chair and a member from its Board to sit on a Liaison Committee that would also include the Mayor and a Council Member from the Municipal Council , supported by administrative staff from each of the organizations . " The mandate of the Liaison Committee could be a simple one .... to foster the working relationship between our organizations and move matters of mutual interest forward in a positive and productive manner , including the identification of budget practices and procedures that will meet the needs of both organizations . Should the London Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working group of both Police and City representatives could be convened to review and bring forward proposed terms of reference for the Liaison Committee , for the approval of both the London Police Services Board and the Municipal Council . <p> Respectfully submitted , From Matt Brown and Stephen Turner <p> The motion will be presented at the Strategic Priorities and Policy Committee meeting , which starts at 4p.m . Monday afternoon .
