@@14363578 @2963578/ <h> Closet Full of Sheep : Surplice Sweater <p> When experienced spinners undertake a large project , they generally spend some time planning the yarn . They might even ( gasp ) try to match a commercial yarn or spin for a desired knitting pattern ! As a beginner , I took a more haphazard approach , as we 've seen from my first vest , first socks , and second vest . I just dove into the spinning , hoping that the resulting yarn could become something knit-worthy . Nowadays , even if I do n't decide on a knitting pattern before I sit down at the wheel , at least I plan the yarn . That habit began around 1997 , and I 've gotten much better at yarn design over time . <h> Yarn Design for Beginners <p> Spinning for my first really big project " a sweater with sleeves ! " also required spinning for a commercial pattern . I 'd made Lily Chin 's surplice wrap sweater before with commercial yarn ; now , I wondered how it would work with a sparkly handspun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed perfect : a brilliant blue merino with multicolored stripes of stellina running through it . <p> This time , I sampled ( a little ) : one skein in singles and one skein in a grotesquely undertwisted 2-ply . ( When you can see daylight between your plies , that 's a bad sign . ) On the 2-ply , the stellina stripes blended into a blue background ; I wanted more glitz . Plus , I could start knitting sooner if I did n't ply . Sometimes laziness short-circuits my decision-making process . <p> So I chose to make singles and even knitted a small swatch before working up all of my fiber . I 'd learned from that sock disaster ! My finished singles lived in a sportweight-DK-worsted range . At the time , I did n't know how to make a control sample for singles yarn , but I did slow down and work at consistency . <h> Knitting the Sweater <p> My spinning consistency improved quite a bit this time around , but I also knew that stitch patterns can camouflage spinning problems . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric 's wrong side . Lily Chin 's garment involved both those stitches , so I was set " I 'd have to wear a lightbox under my sweater for people to see any slubs . <p> However , I 'd never heard of singles slant until someone at my fiber arts guild mentioned it . Singles slant occurs most frequently on stockinette fabrics knit with singles : The yarn 's twist goes in one direction and causes the knitted fabric to slant unintentionally . Unintentional bias can mess up a sweater 's fit as much as cutting and sewing woven fabric off of grain . And there 's no good solution , except to always knit with 2-ply yarns . Somehow , miraculously , my lovely new sweater did not have this problem . It hung squarely on my body and did n't twist out of shape when laid on a flat surface . I 'd dodged a bullet that I had n't even known about " talk about beginner 's luck ! <p> That beginner 's luck has continued ( and I 'm no longer a beginner ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of these days I will investigate further , with three videos from some of my favorite spinning gurus . Patsy Zawistoski explains how to duplicate commercial yarns ; Kate Larson covers handspinning for knitting ; Jillian Moreno teaches the fine points of singles spinning . After all that research , I may discover what I 've been doing right all these years .

Though it contains some useful information , and apparently was intended to be an instruction manual , it really does n't function very well as such . For the more experienced spinner , it can be a useful reference book , or for the beginner who already has the basics down and is seeking more detailed information on a specific topic . Be forewarned : Amos DOES clearly state in the subtitle that it is a " compendium of information , advice , and opinions ... " and it is best treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . While I enjoyed his often whimsical humor , I less enjoyed his tendency to set up a straw argument in order to target it with snide comments .

Add the cardigan versions and you 've got 900 possibilities , without counting neckline , edging , color , and stitch pattern variations . <p> The six sweater styles in this book differ in the way that the sleeves join the body . The first four styles are made by knitting the sweater pieces separately--one back , one or two front(s) , and two sleeves . In general , the pieces are knitted back and forth in rows ( though some designers have methods for working them in the round ) . The other two styles are worked in the round from the bottom up . The body is worked as a tube from the lower edge to the armholes , the sleeves are also worked as tubes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the yoke is worked in a single piece to the neck . <p> The simplest style , the drop shoulder , consists of a rectangle for the front , another rectangle for the back , and two trapezoids for the sleeves . There is no armhole shaping and the tops of the sleeves are sewn directly onto the side edges above the marked armhole positions . <p> The modified drop-shoulder style uses rudimentary shaping to eliminate some excess width at the upper body above the armholes . Stitches are bound off at the base of each armhole on the front and back to form notches that accommodate the upper sleeves . <p> Set-in sleeve sweaters have the most tailored fit . Both the upper body and the tops of the sleeves are shaped to eliminate excess fabric at the armholes . On a well-fitting set-in-sleeve sweater , the armholes fall directly in line with the shoulder bone without pulling or puckering . <p> The saddle shoulder sweater in this book is closely related to the set-in-sleeve style ( though other sweater styles can also have saddles ) .

For the in-the-round method , the body and sleeves are each worked as tubes from the lower edge to the armholes , then joined for the yoke , which is also worked in the round to the neck . The yoke is shaped by decreases worked along four diagonal lines ( two each on the front and back ) that extend from armhole to neck . <p> Seamless yoke sweaters are worked in the round , as the raglan style , but the yoke is shaped by decreases that are placed evenly around the circumference of the yoke . <p> I was so excited to see this book . I knit for folks who range in size from a small child to plus size . <p> Great tips . Easy to use . I am so glad to own this book.Review by Clara ( Posted on 9/26/2015 ) <p> Very pleased <p> I am looking forward to using the pattern templates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah ( Posted on 11/25/2014 ) <p> Design your own sweaters <p> I bought this book a couple of years ago and have used it over and over - for sweaters for my kids , my husband and myself . It is so versatile . I hate to religiously follow patterns . I like to make up my own designs , but lack advanced design tools . This reference ( not really a book ) tells you exactly how to convert your ideas into sweaters , whether it 's a fine gauge summer top or a bulky winter jacket . Also , I do n't like to sew seams , so the raglan and yoke designs that minimize seaming are perfect . Review by Kate ( Posted on 11/4/2014 ) <p> I bought this book years ago and it 's been a great help . I often find patterns I like but either the size I need is not included or the yarn used in the pattern is thicker than I want to use . I wear a size 2XL and pattern in that size are not easy to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me many times to increase the pattern to the size I need . I just look up the pattern closest to the design in my pattern and find the correct yarn and gauge . That will give me a starting point for the number of stitches per row I will need . Things get more complicated if the stitch pattern in my pattern has a different gauge than stockinette stitch , but many patterns work out without any further calculations . Since I am rather large I prefer sweaters , cardigans and vest ( waist coats ) made with thinner yarn , size 3 usually , but patterns for adult sized tops using a thin yarn are hard to find too . Most patterns call for worsted weight or thicker yarn which is just to warm for me and also makes me look even bigger than I am . Again , Knitter 's Handy Book Of Sweater Patterns solves the problem for me and quickly too . I just look for a similar pattern and look up the instructions for that pattern in a different gauge . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different gauge than stockinette stitch pattern will require a few more adjustments , but I always have at least a starting point . The book has been a great help to me and I highly recommend it . The only thing missing , IMHO , are patterns that use stitch patterns that do n't match the gauge of the stockinette pattern and instructions for adjusting the basic patterns in the book to include some of these stitch patterns . For example : It would be nice if the book included instructions for adjusting the number of stitches per row when adding a cable or lace pannel to the basic pattern . Adding instructions that explain how to calculate the number of stitches needed to adjust the basic pattern when adding a cable , lattice work , or lace panel to any pattern would complete the " Knitter 's Handy Book Of Sweater Patterns : Basic Designs in Multiple Sizes and Gauges " , making it a priceless and must-have resource for knitters of all skill levels.Review by Ute Willmore ( Posted on 2/7/2012 ) <p> A great tool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design issues . I am now designing my own patterns based on the knowledge I have aquired . I have recommended this book several times already . A must have for all , especially those who can never take a pattern at face value , but just have to add something of their own to it , like me ! Review by Kim D'Angelo ( Posted on 11/11/2011 ) <p> At Last <p> For a long time , I 've been needing this book . My grandchildren request sweaters with pictures on them . So I do n't have a pattern , and have to make my own . This book takes a lot of guessing out of the shaping . I recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own design.Review by Paulette Povey @qwx186333 @qwx186323 @qwx186336 @qwx186338 @qwx186324

This book offers instructions for the six most common sweater constructions-- drop shoulder , modified drop shoulder , set-in sleeve , saddle shoulder , raglan , and seamless yoke . <p> Each style is provided in fifteen sizes , in 2 " ( 5-cm ) increments from a 26 " ( 66 cm ) chest circumference appropriate for a child to a 54 " ( 137 cm ) chest circumference appropriate for a large adult . And each size is given in five possible gauges--3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 stitches per inch . That 's a whopping 75 options for each of the six styles , or 450 patterns in all ! Add the cardigan versions and you 've got 900 possibilities , without counting neckline , edging , color , and stitch pattern variations . <p> The six sweater styles in this book differ in the way that the sleeves join the body . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately--one back , one or two front(s) , and two sleeves . In general , the pieces are knitted back and forth in rows ( though some designers have methods for working them in the round ) . The other two styles are worked in the round from the bottom up . The body is worked as a tube from the lower edge to the armholes , the sleeves are also worked as tubes to the armhole , the sleeves and body are joined , and the yoke is worked in a single piece to the neck . <p> The simplest style , the drop shoulder , consists of a rectangle for the front , another rectangle for the back , and two trapezoids for the sleeves . There is no armhole shaping and the tops of the sleeves are sewn directly onto the side edges above the marked armhole positions . <p> The modified drop-shoulder style uses rudimentary shaping to eliminate some excess width at the upper body above the armholes . Stitches are bound off at the base of each armhole on the front and back to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaters have the most tailored fit . Both the upper body and the tops of the sleeves are shaped to eliminate excess fabric at the armholes . On a well-fitting set-in-sleeve sweater , the armholes fall directly in line with the shoulder bone without pulling or puckering . <p> The saddle shoulder sweater in this book is closely related to the set-in-sleeve style ( though other sweater styles can also have saddles ) . The difference between the two lies in the " saddle , " an extension of the sleeve top , from the armhole to the neck . <p> The raglan style in this book is worked in the round . For the in-the-round method , the body and sleeves are each worked as tubes from the lower edge to the armholes , then joined for the yoke , which is also worked in the round to the neck . The yoke is shaped by decreases worked along four diagonal lines ( two each on the front and back ) that extend from armhole to neck . <p> Seamless yoke sweaters are worked in the round , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases that are placed evenly around the circumference of the yoke . <p> This book allows me to turn my creative ideas into articles that fit . I have a design in my mind and previously had to do many undos and re-knits to get the right sizing . This book allows me to do it just once.Review by Julie ( Posted on 1/30/2016 ) <p> Wonderful resource <p> I love this !

The discovery of the New World opened up a huge new market for Murano beads . Very portable , easily portioned , and completely novel to Native Americans , seed and bugle beads quickly became the currency of explorers .

They just continue spinning the same way they did for their first successful skein of yarn . The difference between worsted and woolen yarns comes from how the fibers are prepared for spinning , the drafting technique that is used , and how twist is allowed to enter the fibers . There is general agreement among spinners about how to spin true worsted yarns and true woolen yarns . However , most of us spin something between those two types of yarn . <h> Woolen/Worsted R.I.P By Rita Buchanan <p> Often we fall back on jargon like woolen and worsted because we cant think of what else to say . Rita decided to stop focusing so much on the terminology and whether she was really achieving true worsted yarn or mastering a woolen draw .

Of course , you need to have yarns to do this , so acquiring a yarn stash is ever the goal of a weaver . A stash gives inspiration just by being there . <p> Choosing your own yarns for a project is rewarding on many levels . You get the satisfaction of using up something you already have ( always good when family members look perplexed every time you bring in more ) . And you have the joy of creating something completely new from changes in color , sett , yarn texture , or all of these . <p> There are several factors to consider : the yarn 's thickness , its fiber content , and the intended fabric hand . <h> Yarn size <p> An important guide to the thickness of a yarn is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yd/lb as the original yarn in a project , you can usually substitute it straight across ( with some attention to twist for fibers such as wool and silk ) . If you do n't know the yd/lb , you can use a McMorran balance ( Photo a ) or make your own ( Photo b ) . <p> Yardage per pound is very useful as a measurement for comparing cotton and linen yarns , less so for silk , and even less so for wool . For silk and wool , much depends on the tightness of the spin . A very lightly spun , lofty wool , for example , requires a different sett from that of a tightly spun wool " a sett that is also dependent on the desired hand of the fabric . Sampling is the only way to be sure . <h> Determining sett <p> When your yarn is a different size from the example you are inspired by , you 'll have to choose an appropriate sett .

Make a yarn wrap to determine sett . <p> I usually wrap a bit tightly if I know I want a firm plain weave , a bit loosely if I want it open ( as for lace ) . Use a closer sett for twill ( how close depends on twill float length ; the longer the floats , the closer the sett because of the absence of interlacing wefts between warp threads ) . You can use the sett numbers in the Master Yarn Chart 2014. pdf as a guide . And as always , sample to be sure ! <p> " Madelyn <p> If you have a weaving question we would love to hear from you !

If you were to examine all the towel projects in Handwoven ( and there are many ; towels are close to the most favorite , if not the most favorite item for handweavers to make ) , you 'd find they are almost all woven in either 8/2 unmercerized cotton , 22/2 cottolin ( 60% cotton/ 40% linen but about the same size as 8/2 cotton ) , or 10/2 pearl ( mercerized ) cotton . Towels woven in 8/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to absorb water ( the task a towel is supposed to do ) . The shinier finish on 10/2 pearl cotton caused by the chemical process of mercerization does reduce that yarn 's absorbency . Towels woven in mercerized cottons are never as absorbent as those woven in unmercerized cotton ; however , with repeated washings their absorbency increases . <p> To answer your specific question , I do n't think leaving out ironing will make all that much difference , although I do n't iron mine . ( After wiping the first few dishes , the ironed surface is likely to be disturbed . ) In spite of their being less absorbent , however , I happily use towels woven in 10/2 pearl cotton . I especially like the surface created with deflected doubleweave for towels ; the structure forces the yarns to bend , opening up the plies ( as well as opening little spaces between the layers ) to aid absorbency . I 'm including a photo that I hope sort of shows that texture . <p> I think you can happily weave the Ozark Quilter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as you point out , they will not shrink as much as towels in 8/2 cotton , but I 'd just go with the same woven width and length and produce a slightly larger towel . ) <p> Madelyn <p> If you have a weaving question we would love to hear from you !

@@14363688 @2963688/ <h> Kerrys WIP : Ahead of the Curve <p> One of the details I love most about the Buttonside Sweater from Knitting Short Rows is the swoop of the curved shirt hem . When I first saw this design as a sketch , I tried to sort out the construction in my head . Would the body be knit , then the buttonbands applied at the end ? Would this be knit bottom up starting with the hem ? Turns out both of my ideas were incorrect . The secret to the curve of the hem is short-row shaping , of course ! As you already know from my last post , this sweater is knit top down starting at the shoulders . The buttonbands are n't  applied after the body is worked ; they 're worked as part of the body by casting on extra stitches once you reach the bottom of the underarm . <p> The buttonbands themselves are stitched with an easy-to-memorize six-row repeat that works up surprisingly fast . Remembering my row gauge is shorter than it should be from my swatch , and being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added three extra repeats beyond what the pattern calls for . Then the fun part : that curve ! <p> With a few short-rows , the buttonband seamlessly curves and becomes the bottom hem . Once you reach the opposite side , buttonband stitches are grafted together with Kitchener stitch for a nearly invisible join . With that , the back of the sweater is done and the front is worked in a similar manner . Again , stitches are picked up along the shoulder saddle and a bit of neck shaping is added before you work the body . The front of the neckline scoops just a bit lower than the back and is another lovely detail of this design . <p> Next time , I 'll be tackling the short-row shaping of Buttonside 's sleeve caps . I 'm a bit nervous about it , truth be told . I 've only worked this type of sleeve cap once before , and sleeves are a place I tend to stall out in the knitting process . ( Think second sock syndrome , but with sleeves . ) Im excited to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrigue of the design and the desire to have a finished wearable will keep the momentum going .

Her Crystal Falls Earrings are featured in February/March 2017 Beadwork . We recently talked to Melissa about how she got started beading , how she uses color in her designs , and the inspiration for her 2017 DOY projects . <p> Q : How did you get started beading ? <p> A : I started beading because I was home with a new baby , my son , who is now 10 years old , and I was incredibly bored . I had always done art and worked and gone to school , so just being home with a baby was n't stimulating enough for me . My good friend from college introduced me to his aunts bead store , and I was hooked ! I learned from the store owner and employees , then started working at the store soon after . I learned all the basics about beading there , as well as how to write beading patterns and how to teach beadweaving . <h> Channeling Creativity <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What inspires your creativity ? <p> A : Shapes and patterns from the natural world are inspirational to me , as are the extreme designs found in haute couture fashion . I love the mathematical patterns found in nature and try to utilize mathematical relationships in my own work . <p> Q : Do you plan your designs in advance , or do you just let the creativity flow ? <p> A : Most of the time I design with at least some idea of the finished piece in mind . Sometimes it goes easily and I 'm able to produce almost exactly what I 'm imagining . Other times , what I imagine does n't  work out exactly and during the process the design changes based on the constraints of the materials I 'm working with . Sometimes I start with a vague idea that becomes more clear once I get beadingagain , based on the constraints of the beads and the thread . <h> Finding Your Way <p> Q : How do you get out of a creative rut ? <p> A : The best thing to get myself out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@14363721 @2963721/ <h> Technique of the Week : Nail Your Gauge <p> Have you ever followed a pattern exactly , using the same yarn and needle size as specified in the directions , only to have your project come out a totally different size than you were expecting ? Whether it 's a hat that could be used as a punch bowl cozy or a sweater that fits a handpuppet rather than a human , the problem is incorrect gauge . Gauge is the number of stitches and rows in a certain measurement ; for Interweave patterns , gauge is given over 4 ? . It 's also key to making sure your finished project fits . <p> The first step for any project is a gauge swatch . Work at least a 6 ? square in the stitch pattern for your project . If it 's a stockinette project , work a stockinette swatch ; if it 's a lace project , work a swatch in the lace pattern . Always block your swatch as you plan to block your project . If you 're planning to wash your finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolwash and let it dry completely . No cheating and measuring while it 's still a little damp ! This will help cut down on surprises later " there 's nothing worse than finishing a project only to have it grow two sizes when you block it . <p> Another thing to take into account is stretch . If you 're using a drapey yarn without a lot of memory , or using a stretchy stitch pattern like garter stitch , hang your swatch for a few days to see if it gets longer and narrower at all . You can also hang a few small weights like binder clips on the bottom to encourage stretching . Some fibers like alpaca and cotton are notorious for growing longer and longer as gravity works its magic on them . Not all swatches will stretch out , but it 's always good to check . <p> Once it 's blocked , measure your gauge in the center of the swatch . The gauge at the edges of the swatch can be a bit misleading , so do n't measure the entire piece. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on your knee to measure can cause the piece to stretch slightly and give you incorrect gauge . <p> Be sure to measure over at least 4 ? to get the most accurate stitch count . A slight misjudgment in stitch count makes a huge difference in a small measurement , but has less impact over a wider measurement . For example , imagine you 're measuring your swatch , and it 's hard to decide if there 's another half stitch in there . You decide to round up . If you 're measuring just 1 ? , you 're going to overestimate by -+ stitch per inch , which is a huge difference in gauge ! 4-+ sts/1 ? = 4-+ sts/in 16-+ sts/4 ? = 4 sts/in <p> Half a stitch per inch does n't sound like a lot , but it makes a big difference when you 're making a sweater . Say you 're making a 40 ? sweater . If the pattern calls for 4 sts per inch , and you 're working at 4-+ sts per inch , your sweater will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 ? = 160 sts 160 sts ++ 4-+ sts/in = 35-+ " <p> That 's a lot smaller ! The same principle applies to all gauge measurements : if the pattern calls for a gauge of 18 sts over 4 ? and you 're getting 19 sts over 4 ? , do n't just shrug it off as " close enough . " Keep swatching until you match stitch gauge . Taking accurate stitch gauge measurements is the difference between making a sweater that fits and one that does n't . Row gauge is also important , but it 's easier to work around ; most patterns call to knit the piece to a certain length rather than giving a specific number of rows . <p> Once you have your gauge sorted out , compare it to the gauge in the pattern . If there 's a small difference in gauge , try changing needle sizes . If you have more stitches per inch than the pattern gauge , go up a needle size ; your stitches are too small , and you need a larger needle . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go down a needle size ; your stitches are too big , and you need a smaller needle . In most cases , this should fix the difference in gauge . If changing needle size does n't achieve pattern gauge , it will take a little bit of math to adjust the pattern ; we 'll discuss that approach in a later post . <p> Whether you 're making socks or a sweater , gauge is the most important factor in knitting a project that fits . Always take the time to check your gauge ; it takes a lot less time than reknitting your entire project !

It 's impossible to answer . Music , like beadwork , is a blend of styles built up slowly from a simple idea , a basic chord progression or stitch pattern , into a complex conversation . Peyote stitch is so often that basic chord progression , that formula from which the rest is built . It can be flat , circular , tubular , odd-count , even-count , or diagonal . It combines easily with herringbone , brick stitch , netting , square stitch , and countless embellishments . The Variations on Peyote Stitch pattern bundle is a celebration of peyote in all its forms and functions . Because every song needs a good melody . <h> The Melody : Flat Peyote <p> Flat Peyote is the heart of all peyote beadwork and gives us the basic thread path and bead structure . After your first row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip 1 , pass back through . It will be loose at first and may look like this : <p> After the first two rows are strung you can tighten your work , encouraging the beads to stack . <h> Variations <p> Variations of flat peyote include even-count , odd-count , two-drop , two needle , and diagonal , along with increases , decreases , openings , and accents . Even count and odd-count is perhaps the most significant distinction . Even and odd refer to the number of beads in a row . Even-count is quick and does n't require turnarounds while odd-count does . <h> Even and Odd Count <p> Even Count Peyote Stitch <p> Odd Count Peyote Stitch <h> Diagonal <p> This essential variation on peyote stitch uses end-row increases and decreases to create a strip of beadwork with directionality and movement . At first glance , it can be difficult to tell that projects worked with this technique are peyote stitch . <h> Projects <p> The Variations on Peyote Stitch pattern bundle includes five projects that use flat peyote stitch to form the core of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs are anything but basic , or , at least , beautifully basic . <h> The Rhythm : Circular Peyote Stitch <p> Circular peyote is simply flat peyote worked in a circle . It can lend your design smooth movement , flow , and curvilinear contours . Once you 've mastered flat peyote , it 's an easy next step and will add a certain groove to your beadwork . <p> Most circular peyote-stitch pieces are worked from the inside out as it 's usually easier to control the shape by working increases instead of decreases . <h> Increases and Decreases <p> While working with increases is often preferable , decreases are useful when working to close the center of a piece of beadwork . Make them gradual or rapid by experimenting with the number of new beads introduced and with what frequency . <p> Increases <p> Decreases <h> Transitions <p> Circular peyote is often combined with other stitches to create designs with diverse shapes and styles .

@@14363732 @2963732/ <h> Tales of a Beginning Spinner : Change Your Whorl , Change Your Yarn <p> By my second lesson , I had been spinning for a little over a week . The wheel and I had become close friends as we traveled to and from work together , the wheel buckled safely into my passenger seat . Now that I was more familiar with the spinning wheel , it was time to focus on controlling the diameter of my yarn . <p> It 's not difficult to tell the difference between my lumpy first skein and a more even second . <h> A Whole New Whorl <p> Since my first spinning lesson , I have been able to transform yarn from a muddle of fiber to a passable , almost respectable , beginner 's strand . Spinners in the Interweave office seemed impressed ! I discovered that to achieve yarn of a more consistent diameter , I needed to draft the same amount of fiber each time . <p> During the second lesson , I learned about more ways to control yarn size . Until now , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning wheel ; lesson two began with switching the whorls . Though I had grown more familiar with it , I still found the whole apparatus a bit intimidating , so changing anything at this point felt like a challenge . <p> Sure enough , even that little adjustment required other alterations on the wheel : the drive band became slacker with the smaller whorl , so I adjusted the vertical placement of the bobbin with the knob on top of the wheel . Before moving the bobbin up , I also had to add more slack to the brake band on the bobbin , as the wheel is set up in scotch tension . I continued making small tweaks until the bobbin , which had stopped turning , worked again . It turns out that the spinning wheel and I still have a long way to go before we really know each other . <p> The smaller whorl caused more rotations of the wheel per treadle , which resulted in more twist in the yarn . It was easier to make thin yarn because the extra twist added strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbin faster to avoid too much twist buildup . It felt a bit like spinning at hyper speed , and I found it hard to keep up . <h> Finding my Preference <p> Of the two whorls I tried , I prefer spinning on the larger one . I can feed the yarn onto the bobbin slower , which gives me more time to think about the process and my technique . As I become more skilled , I might give the smaller whorl another go if I want to spin thin yarn . <p> My instructor , Elizabeth , told me that preferences among spinners vary when it comes to how to control yarn size . Some spinners prefer to control it with their body and hands , as Rita Buchanan talks about in her video How I Spin . Others prefer to make adjustments to the wheel . After experimenting with both of these techniques , I found that adjusting my hands and body was easier than adjusting the wheel . By changing my treadling speed and the amount of fiber I am drafting , I can control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the setup of the wheel . I 'm not usually one to take the easy way out , but for now , the less complicated the better . As I become more familiar with the wheel and its parts , however , maybe this could change . <h> Next Steps <p> After a little more practicing spinning yarn for size consistency , I get to change things up a bit . So far , I 've been spinning a white fiber . I will soon spin two bobbins of colored yarn to learn to ply threads . I 'm excited to add some color to the mix and embark on the next spinning step ! <p> Stay tuned to see the results of my colored , plied yarn in next week 's post . <p> Jenna <p> Featured Image : I learned to spin on the larger of these two whorls .

I used all kinds of tools , helping my dad work on things ; I played in creeks and climbed trees , poked sticks in fires like a pro and " helped " my grandmother build fires in her old wood stove . So I do n't recall ever being afraid of tools or fire , but when I started soldering , I admit being a tiny bit timid about the torchthe tank more than the fire , of course . Thankfully , a simple switch to a different type of torch put those fears away . <p> It makes me sad to hear aspiring jewelry makers say they do n't  solder , enamel , or torch-fire metal clay because they 're afraid of using a torch . I understand that fear is real and valid , but that does n't  stop me from trying to convert the torch-free to the torch-whee team ! <p> I also love hearing success stories of fellow jewelry makers who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad-girl ( or tough-guy ) selves and made the leap . here 's one of those stories , from Darlene Armstrong , owner of The Denver School of Metal Arts and instructor of our Getting Started Precious Metal Clay Series , four upcoming Interweave metal clay courses , including Torch Firing PMC Introduction . <h> Getting to Know Darlene Armstrong <p> Tammy : Tell us how you got started in the wonderful world of jewelry making . <p> Darlene : I was born to it . I wanted to make jewelry when I was 5 . I also wanted to marry Cochise and live in a teepee . Being a chiefs wife and making jewelry sounded like a great life . <p> I took my first two courses in metals in 1989 . Both courses were flops , a waste of time and money . So , basically , I went home and began to experiment and teach myself through trial and error . Remember , there was no Internet , computers , or cell phones then . The only instruction was out of books and a few DVDs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there was knowledge gained . I was not bothered by the failure rate , because I was trying to get somewhere , and as long as I was learning ( even the hard way ) , it was fascinating and rewarding . <h> Darlenes Sound Advice <p> T : What would you say to students wanting to learn to make jewelry today ? <p> D : If students knew how many , many , many pieces of silver jewelry I blew up along the way , they would not believe it . I find students nowadays want the easy path to jewelry making . What they need to know is there is no easy path to professional-looking jewelry making . <p> If you happen to discover excellent jewelry teachers and you spend time ( lots of time ) over five to 10 years , you will be successful faster . Nothing can stop you . The secret is devotion to your creative development by hours and hours and hours of practice . Good teaching can propel you on your path faster , but there is NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PRACTICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach your goal of sophisticated jewelry design . I spent 30 to 40 hours a week ( worked part-time to pay bills and lived very frugally ) working in my jewelry shop ; plus I was a single mom and had very little money to purchase silver and other supplies . <h> Follow Your Passion <p> I sold everything I made while learning and bought materials with that money . I turned down offers for going to lunch or shopping or just hanging out with friends so I could devote myself . I worked eight hours minimum a day , four to five days a week , for 15 straight years . I have now been metalsmithing almost 30 years and have approximately 38,000 hours of metalsmithing experience . I still find it utterly fascinating , and I am completely smitten with the whole process . I absolutely LOVE IT ! <p> You just have to understand that it takes time , time to develop your skills and techniques . Be patient and enjoy the process ! Even if you can work three full days a week , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Days in a row will produce more work than pecking at it occasionally . You will also retain more of what you learned while practicing . <p> Make five or 10 copies of the project you made in class and you will have the techniques firmly embedded in your brain . You can not retain the techniques without practicing each of them until it is second nature . <h> Is There a Doctor in the House ? <p> D : My favorite technique is constantly changing . Usually though , it centers around something new that I have not perfected yet and am still figuring it out . I love the mental and physical process of creating . It is such a hook for me . At this very moment in time , I am working on some enameling ideas using white enamel and gold foil , black and white enamel designs that are over-fired on purpose to create a crazy-fun effect and making other experimental enamel pieces that can be incorporated into my other metal designs . <p> I LOVE EXPERIMENTING ! I feel like a metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a metal scientist looking for metal alchemy ! <h> Solder Like a Lady : Overcoming Fear of the Torch <p> T : Speaking of fire , how did you overcome your fear of the torch ? <p> D : Well , that is a good story . I did have a very real ( not imagined ) fear that I would blow myself up if I turned on my torch . Not too far off , considering any kind of torch is in effect a bomb , if mishandled . There is the rub though . Mis-handling is where the problem lies . I took two metalsmithing courses to be able to learn to become comfortable using a torch , but the classes were so poorly outfitted for equipment and over filled with 20 students for one teacher ; it was practically impossible to get any real torch experience . <p> I had a propane torch for a full year before I actually had the guts to light it . Talk about nervous ! Once I had done it a few times ( and was still in one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I am a strong proponent of SAFETY ! Please know what you are doing before you do it . Tie your hair back , protect your eyes , and use ventilation for the gas , flux and solder fumes . Nowadays there are videos from professionals about torch safety . <p> So come on ladies ! Put your big-girl panties on and go for it ! Most guys are not afraid and have no qualms about using a torch , even for the first time . ( Learn more about how Darlene overcame her torch fear and how you can , too , in her #solderlikealady video ! ) <h> Metal Clay- Love <p> T : What advice do you have for people who want to make metal or metal clay jewelry but who fear the flame ? <p> D : Being afraid is perfectly normalespecially for women . If you are too afraid to try it on your own , take a reputable beginning course that will walk you through how to use the torch and then let you use it to fire your piece with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that it is not as scary as you imagined , you can look into other metal clay courses that you can take in person or online that will help you advance your techniques and skill set . Metal clay is an amazing material , and I would not be able to make cool components and pieces without it . It is worth the monetary and time investment to learn how to create with it . The options it affords are endless and exciting . <h> Not a One Medium Woman <p> T : What other creative pursuits or crafts do you enjoy ? <p> D : I love glass of any kind ( blown , slumped ) . I make jewelry out of slumped dichroic glass that I make in the kiln , and I have a solar-powered hand-blown light that comes on at dusk . <p> I do n't  know if this counts or not , but I am really interested in learning how to create amazing outdoor spaces . I love being outside , and I have made metal jewelry outside , and that is sooooo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas inside-outside " and one called " yard makeover , " which I have just started . I love planning and working on having a beautiful space to read , write , and visit with friends and family . I am working on my back porch right now , and it is really a sweet spot for me . I put up star lights that subtly change colors , and I have mini lights in one of the potted trees . <p> I get to sit on my porch and watch the birds come to eat from my bird feeders . I have two sets of cardinals that come every morning and evening . A pair of house finches decided to make a nest in my front door wreath ! I have a weeping cherry tree and a star magnolia to put in the ground soon that are stunning when flowering . There are few things in this world more satisfying than spending time outside in a cozy , colorful creative space where there is beauty , birds , and peace ! <h> The Allure <p> T : It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. traditional metalwork . Which side are you on and why ? <p> D : I actually love this question as I am one of the few metalsmiths ( that I know of ) that has fully embraced this relevant and remarkable product . When Precious Metal Clay ( PMC ) first came out in 1990 , I had been making silver jewelry for a little over two years . When I heard about it , I got so excited , because I had a lot of ideas swimming in my head that I did not know if I would ever be able to create . <p> Metal clay made it possible to design in a textural/dimensional way that was only available through casting metals . I took a casting course and I was absolutely terrible at wax carving . I love to carve , but things that are more dense , not sticky and soft . Even though PMC is fine silver , it can be molded , carved , sanded , filed , drilled , and polished . You can create focal points quickly and easily . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in my metalsmithed pieces , components and focal points . <p> I think a lot of naysayers have seen a lot of what is being made using PMC that is not very refined . Metalsmiths are usually not into the organic look but want something that is elegant , unusual , and professional looking . This can be accomplished with metal clay once you learn how the product can perform . This , of course , takes practice ! <h> Expand Your View <p> Ive been using and experimenting with PMC for 17 years now , and I still have a long way to go . The material is that good and versatile . We PMC users are still pushing the envelope to see where else it can take us . Yes , it can be crafty looking , but it can also be fantastic looking , too . It depends on who is using it , what their background experience is , and what they are looking to achieve . Beginners with no metalsmithing experience will have something that is more crafty-looking , and a metalsmith will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regular metals and come up with surprising results . <p> I think if more metalsmiths would get some decent instruction and then try PMC to make some of their own designs , they would be blown away by what they could achieve . I personally think PMC is a way to enhance your metalsmithing design options once you see what it is capable of doing . It is also a good starting point for someone with little or no experience who wants to create metal jewelry without a lot of expense for machinery and set up . Again , I suggest a reputable class in PMC to get the idea of how the product performs and how to torch fire it before venturing out on your own . <h> Once in a Lifetime <p> T : Do you have an " Ill never do that again ! " story ? <p> D : I built a wire cuff with about 100 solder joints , and it took me about 40 hours to complete it . It came out beautiful and was on display in the Denver Art Museum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit off a lot more than I wanted to chew when I designed it , having no clue how long it would take to make it or how tedious the process would be !

Always fun , and always classic , it turns out the pineapple is a symbol of both hospitality , and affluence . Enjoy ! <p> Gorgeous thread doilies provided my first introduction to the crochet pineapple motif . In fact , one of my first projects was a pineapple motif thread doily in green thread . <p> My gauge might have been a little tight , and I could never quite curb the curl , but I loved the look of the lacy pineapple motifs . After that first doily , I remember seeing hundreds of thread tablecloths , doilies , and dresser scarves with their delicate pineapple motifs . <p> I took the design for granted , but as pineapple motifs move to more garments and DK and worsted weight yarns , I find myself curious about their history . Crochet pineapples appeared in vintage patterns as early as the mid-eighteen hundreds . I have also seen pineapples in carved furniture " though sometimes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are stories of pineapples being symbols of hospitality . Because pineapples were grown in the Caribbean and Hawaii , they were expensive to transport to the mainland U.S. and other countries . So serving pineapples was an example of affluence . <p> The classic pineapple crochet motif we are all accustomed to became popular in the 1920s and 1930s . A fascination with Hawaii made pineapples popular again in the 50s and 60s " think of the video production of Roger 's and Hammerstein 's South Pacific , Gidget , and Elvis .

@@14363802 @2963802/ <h> Hannah 's Top 10 Patterns of 2016 <p> Another year is on the brink of becoming a memory , and the natural reflection of the year passed is nigh . I took a look back at the Interweave Knitting team issues of the year " all Interweave Knits , knitscene , and Love of Knitting publications " to pick my favorites from 2016 . So , not in order of preference but rather in the order of publication , here are my top 10 patterns from 2016 ! <p> This sock pattern uses slip stitches to create a meandering pattern with the contrast yarn . The ball of variegated yarn makes the two socks slightly different from one another , yet they are a clear match . So cute ! <p> I like the basic shape and simple pattern of this tank top . And it seems like something I could easily incorporate into my wardrobe ( in a color other than pink " I do n't think I own a single pink article of clothing ! ) . <p> The interesting shape of the Edora Cowl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and wide on one side and super narrow on the other , for optimum doubling-up action . The lace pattern and teeny fringe are also fun and playful . <p> This cardigan is cozy and scrumptious ! It 's probably the softest thing I 've ever felt . The cables look more advanced than what I am used to , but if I can get my hands on that yarn I might yet make this sweater for myself in that beautiful Parchment colorway . <p> This is the only project on this list I actually made this year ! The off-the-shoulder neck is a super fun feature that is made simply with short-rows . Try a tubular bind-off at the cuffs and body hem for a more finished look and extra-stretchy ends !

I can whip out a dozen pairs of earrings in a couple of hours without batting an eye , but making a single bracelet can sometimes stump me for days . Logically , I know it should n't be this way . After all , a bracelet typically takes fewer materials than a necklace and is only a few beads more than I would use for earrings . <p> When I find myself moving my beads repeatedly around my design board , I know its time for me to seek some inspiration . To help me with my latest creative block , I gathered some ideas from expert jewelry designers who make all types of bracelets by combining beads , wire , leather , and ribbon with a variety of techniques , including bead weaving , stringing , wire working , and mixed media . <h> Disguise the Clasp <p> Unlike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neck , a bracelets clasp is always on display . This used to irritate me until I embraced the philosophy , If you 've got it , flaunt it ! Former Beadwork editor Melinda Barta is a master at this technique .

Each brilliant peyote-stitched flower uses a combination of crystals , pearls , glass teardrops , and seed beads .

The Whistle Stop Bracelet by Marcia L. Balonis in Stitching with Shaped Beads : 10 Beading Projects to Make with Tile &amp; Brick Beads shows how combining three different 2-hole bead shapes can make a fabulous cuff . <p> Whistle Stop Bracelet by Marcia L. Balonis <h> Make Multiples <p> This advice sounds counterintuitive if bracelets are n't  your favorite type of jewelry to make . But if you like a bracelet you 've already made , why not make a few more in different colors ? Stacks of bracelets are still very fashionable . I like the Brick Tracks Bracelet by Marjorie Schwartz in Stitching with Shaped Beads : 10 Beading Projects to Make with Tile &amp; Brick Beads . It looks great and its an easy and quick peyote-stitch project . <p> Brick Tracks Bracelet by Marjorie Schwartz <h> Splurge on a Unique Focal <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 Projects to make for under $20 shows how you can finish a bracelet with ribbon if you 've spent most your beading budget on a unique artist-made bead .

If they 're too large , theyll fall off . If they 're too small , the clasp wont close . This simple Bodacious Copper Bangle by Kim St. Jean in- 10 Wire Bracelet Projects eBook is just the kind of classic shape that fits a wide range of wrist sizes . <p> Bodacious Copper Bangle by Kim St. Jean <h> Go Bold <p> I tend towards a minimalist look in the jewelry I make .

( Or perhaps , more honestly , hoarded them in my bead drawer for a few years . ) This bracelet reminds me that sometimes its good to go all out in a bold jewelry design ! <p> Hot Summer Flowers by Kate McKinnon <h> Mix Your Metals <p> Not everything needs to match ! The Vintage Lace in Rings bracelet by Sue Ripsch in 10 Chain Maille Jewelry Designs- uses a combination of sterling silver , yellow gold , and rose gold jump rings . This a striking look for jewelry . In addition , I find that changing up the colors while doing chain maille helps me keep my place when working and find it again when I pick up the project later . <p> Vintage Lace in Rings by Sue Ripsch <h> Think Everyday Looks <p> If you saw my handmade jewelry , youd see that I find it easier to make jewelry for a specific occasion such as a wedding or prom .

The Whimsical Wrapped Bangle by Cassie Donlen is one way to use up a few random beads in your stash . <p> Whimsical Wrapped Bangle by Cassie Donlen <p> Many wire jewelry designs require precision . If you do n't  use wire regularly , this exactness can feel intimidating . Swirls and Whirls by Pepper Mentz shows you how you can bend short pieces of wire randomly ( there 's no wrong way ! ) to create a modern bracelet . ( Both projects are featured in 10 Wire Bracelet Projects eBook . ) <p> Swirls and Whirls by Pepper Mentz <h> Embellish a Premade Cuff <p> One of the easiest ways to make a bracelet is to start with a purchased leather cuff .

@@14363820 @2963820/ <h> Making Metal : The Magic of Argentium Sterling Silver from its Creator Peter Johns <p> You 're probably at least a little familiar with Argentium sterling silver . Argentium is a silver alloy that is 93.5% silver with mostly copper and some germanium making up the rest . Argentium does n't  develop firescale , resists tarnish , and has been enticing jewelry makers for about 25 years . <p> I do n't  know about you , but the idea of creating a new metal alloy is right up there with magic and something you could only learn from Dumbledore at Hogwarts . In other words , I 'm fascinated by the whole idea , and my mind races with questions about how it all happened . Fortunately , I recently had the opportunity to ask Peter Johns , the inventor of Argentium sterling silver , to answer some of my questions about Argentium and how this beloved metal came to be . Heres what I found out . <p> TJ : What is your background and job title ? What does one study to become a metal alloy creator ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London . I worked in the trade in London for 15 years before joining Middlesex University . I am now past retirement age but I currently act as a consultant for Argentium International Limited . <p> My silversmithing background and an inquisitive mind led me to carry out some research for a mining company called Metaleurope . The research was to find new uses for one of their special metals called germanium . About the same time , a student asked me a question about firescale . This triggered my thoughts that germanium might be able to solve the problem of firescale in traditional sterling silver . This was the start of Argentium . <p> Argentium sterling silver earrings by Cynthia Eid <p> TJ : How do you use Argentium sterling silver ? Do you make jewelry ? <p> PJ : My focus with Argentium is in further research and development . I rarely have time to create finished pieces , although I do enjoy teaching workshops and lecturing about Argentium silver and its working properties . <p> TJ : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentium ? Were you trying to create a firescale-free silver alloy or was that a happy accident ? <p> PJ : Although my initial goal was to create a firescale-resistant alloy , it soon became evident that germanium imparts other unique and beneficial properties . These benefits include tarnish resistance , the ability to be fused to itself and other metals , and the ability to be heat-hardened at low temperatures . <p> Mr. Johns shared this fascinating video that he and his students at Middlesex University created about the discovery of Argentium sterling silver . <p> TJ : Can you tell us briefly how one creates a new metal alloy ? <p> PJ : Creating a new metal alloy involves comprehensive and structured research and testing . You have to ensure that the new material is able to perform well within the many and varied working practices in the industryfrom small- to high-volume production processes . Basically , Argentium is required to do everything that traditional sterling silver has ever done , plus much more ! <p> TJ : Why does n't  Argentium develop firescale ? <p> PJ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silver is unique in its ability to absorb oxygen . The longer sterling silver is heated for annealing and soldering applications and the higher the temperature , the deeper the oxygen can penetrate below the surface . The silver is not oxidized during these heating operations . The copper is though , and a dark colored , sub-surface copper oxide is formed that is difficult to removethis is known as firescale . Argentium contains silver and copper plus germanium . The germanium alloyed in Argentium silver oxidizes preferentially to the copper during the heating operations . It produces a transparent , self-healing oxide that stops the oxygen from entering the silver and , therefore , protects the copper from oxidizing . As Argentium does n't  firescale , it also does n't  require plating or strong acids to hide or remove the penetrating oxide . <p> TJ : Are there any safety considerations ( other than fire/torch safety ) that Argentium users need to know ? <p> PJ : Regarding safety , we would recommend observing the same safety precautions as you would when working with traditional sterling silver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think jewelry makers need to know about Argentium ? <p> PJ : It is recommended to become familiar with the paler red glow that Argentium silver emits when it is heated compared to standard sterling silver . Argentium also cools more slowly than traditional sterling silver . Care should be taken to allow Argentium silver to cool sufficiently before touching or quenching . <p> fused Argentium sterling silver earrings by Cynthia Eid <p> You can learn all there is to know about working with Argentium , including how to solder it and how to know when it can be quenched , in our Argentium Sterling Silver videos . In our store you 'll find Cynthia Eids three popular videos on how to use Argentium sterling silver for jewelry making , including soldering , fusing , and granulation , for which Argentium is particularly well suited .

The Eastham Poncho , featured in the new knit.wear Wool Studio collection , is a lovely example of the swoncho . <p> The Eastham Poncho features a roomy upper body with little definition between sleeves and body , making it a hybrid of a knitted poncho and a sweater " a swoncho ! <h> The Latest Sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and features an exaggerated attached sleeve that makes the garment more like a poncho with a waistband than a sweater with true sleeves . <p> The shoulders are shaped with short-rows for a neater fit , and the sleeve fabric is increased with raglan-style shaping .

@@14363831 @2963831/ <h> Tales of a Beginning Spinner : Spinning Life Lessons <p> Learning to spin was a whirlwind of new experiences , and after relocating far from home to take on a new job , I was feeling particularly open to new things . Spinning entered my life at a transition period where I was into both trying different things and thinking introspectively about the journey of life . Spinning lessons became spinning life lessons . <p> No doubt , there is no better place to learn to spin than Interweave . My coworkers are not only knowledgeable and dedicated to their crafts , but they are also eager to teach others . After five weeks of spinning lessons , I found that what I was learning could easily transfer into my daily life . Perhaps this list of spinning life lessons can serve as a nice reminder for you . ( See the links at the end of this post to follow my journey week by week. ) <h> 1 . There 's always room for progress . <p> My spinning coworkers applauded even my first handspun that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging and positive people , but I also think it has something to do with an understanding that every spinner has room for progress " especially in the beginning . At first , all yarn is good yarn . The goal , then , becomes making better yarn the next time . I am reminded to not be too hard on myself as I try something new . <p> My first ever piece of handspun yarn shows that I have lots of room for improvement . <h> 2 . Everyone starts somewhere . <p> When my teacher and coworker Elizabeth began my lessons , I made a joke that she must have been born attached to a spinning wheel because she seemed like such a natural . But , of course years of practice made Elizabeth seem like a natural . Maybe she even felt as awkward as I did when she started spinning fiber . In spinning and everything else , everyone has to start somewhere ! I 've learned not to compare myself with others , especially those with more experience . <h> 3 . It 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spinning was quite the wake-up call . Not only does it take a lot of work to make decent-looking yarn , but also , perfect handspun does n't exist ! What is perfect to one person might not be perfect to another . What matters is that you enjoy your handspun , and that you enjoyed the process of making it . While spinning , I constantly had to remind myself to lighten up because I was gripping the fiber too hard and was n't able to draft . So in life , I want to remember to relax and lighten up , or else forward motion will be quite difficult ! <p> This plied yarn will soon become a pot holder . <h> 4 . Sometimes it 's nice to keep it simple . <p> The spinning wheel is a complex and intricate device that is fun to use , but learning to spin on a drop spindle felt like a breath of fresh air . It 's like writing with a pen on paper rather than typing in a word processor . Although it might be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the simplicity of what we 're doing , letting us appreciate humble beginnings . Find joy in the simple things ! <h> 5 . Control what you can . <p> There are many things in life and in spinning that we ca n't control , but we can do our best to see that the things we can control go well . Controlling the twist in spinning was one of the most important things I needed to keep in mind . If not focused on my fiber-pinching fingers , I 'd have a mess of twist in my fiber source . <h> 6 . There will always be choices . Lots and lots of choices . But do n't be overwhelmed ! <p> Spinning is full of options . Wheel or spindle ? High-whorl or low-whorl spindle ? Electric spinning wheel ? Castle spinning wheel ? What kind of fiber ? What color fiber ? I 'm getting overwhelmed already " but the bottom line is that it all serves the same purpose : to create handspun yarn . I find it useful to think less about making the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying new things , and enjoying the experience . <p> My spinning lessons have come to an end , but it is not the end of my spinning . Although I do n't think I 'll be investing in a wheel in the near future ( I 'm on a budget ) , I have acquired a spindle and plan on using it . To sum it up , my spinning teachers have taught me a lot about spinning , and spinning has taught me a lot about so much more !

@@14363842 @2963842/ <p> The origin of the black-and-white-striped prison uniform goes back to the Auburn prison system that started in New York in the 1820s . In this system prisoners had to be silent , walk in " lockstep , " and they all wore black and white uniforms covered in stripes that symbolized prison bars . ( On another fiber-related note , prisoners in Auburn also raised silkworms and wove silk cloth as part of their restitution . ) <p> The uniforms made prisoners immediately recognizable as criminals , so if a prisoner escaped , the public could easily distinguish them from the non-criminal population . Eventually , by the mid-twentieth century , these prison stripes fell out of favor and solid-colored jumpsuits became the norm . <p> In recent years , though , the striped prison uniform has been making a comeback as more prisons are abandoning the orange jumpsuit . In fact , prison supplier Bob Barker ( no relation to the former game show host ) has a whole line of striped jumpsuits available in a rainbow of colors.

A good mandrel can help you form perfect shapes every time . In the July 2011 issue of Lapidary Journal Jewelry Artist , Helen Driggs presented a definitive look at mandrels . To follow is an excerpt from Helen 's column , " Cool Tools &amp; Hip Tips : Bracelet , Ring , and Favorite Mandrels . " <p> After you 've mastered your basic bench tools , the hunt for a mandrel is usually the next order of business . There is a simple reason for this : arms , necks , ankles , fingers , and even toes ! are round , and sheet or other metal stock is n't . <p> When you want to take flat stock or sheet to a 3D jewelry form , you need something to shape it against . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming is fundamental jewelry-making skill , and using a mandrel is the easiest of the metal forming processes . You will be amazed at how far you can move a piece of well-annealed metal against a mandrel . I 've sized a heavy man 's ring up two full sizes with nothing more than determination , a round mandrel , and a rawhide mallet . <h> Bracelet Mandrels <p> There are two shape options for bracelet mandrels : oval and round . Usually , oval mandrels are for cuffs , and round mandrels are for bangles . Both shapes come stepped or tapered , and both are available in wood , steel , and/or plastic . <p> Some bracelet mandrels include a tang , or metal tab , to secure them in a vise while you 're hammering . I prefer a mandrel with a tang because it leaves both my hands free when I am forming . <p> Stepped mandrels are accurate for sizing , and you do n't have to flip your work to prevent an unintentional taper in the piece . The consistent size of each step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wrist . This is helpful if you are adding stone settings . For a very wide cuff or gauntlet , choose a tapered oval mandrel and because your arm is tapered from wrist to elbow , a wide cuff will be more comfortable to wear if it tapers . <h> Ring Mandrels <p> There are several types of ring mandrels : tapered , grooved , flat sided , rounded square , and stepped . Many of them come with incised calibration lines for accurate sizing . Most people start with a plain , round tapered mandrel because most people start making plain round band rings . <h> Other Handy Mandrels <p> It is always a good idea to have an assortment of mandrels in the shop . Here are some of my favorites . <p> Hoop earring mandrel : A nice , tapered cone mandrel is great for all kinds of forms , not just hoop earrings . You can create cones , funnels , hoops , bands , and Mobius strips with this handy mandrel . <p> Bezel mandrels : I keep an assortment of these in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . My absolute favorite is the tiny , tapered round bezel mandrel from Italy . I can make perfect 5mm bezels with it , and I love it . <p> Jump ring mandrels : These are basic , round , hardened tool rod steel in a variety of sizes . I keep these around the shop not only for coiling jump rings , but also for supporting metal tubing as I rivet , drill , or otherwise manipulate it . You can find tool rod in many shapes and metals at the hardware store . <h> Hammer and Mandrel Combos <p> While mandrels are usually wood , plastic , or metal , the hammers or other striking tools you use with them also vary in material and may be metal , wood , hide , or plastic . Usually the mandrel metal is steel , but there are aluminum ring mandrels , too . If you are forming a ring and not just sizing , stick to steel . Aluminum is very soft , and you can dent it with a misplaced hammer strike . <p> Figuring out which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result you want is easy , if you remember these guidelines : steel + steel = quickly stretch or compress metal ; steel + wood , plastic , or hide = slowly stretch or compress metal .

Do n't  worry if you do n't  know " many spinners do not know the answer ! They just continue spinning the same way they did for their first successful skein of yarn . The difference between worsted and woolen yarns comes from how the fibers are prepared for spinning , the drafting technique that is used , and how twist is allowed to enter the fibers .

The Oxford English Dictionary 's first reference to the word " tailor " is from the year 1297 A.D. , by which time weaving and tailoring guilds and cloth merchants were well established in Europe . In England , custom tailoring is known as " bespoke " tailoring , a term coined in London 's famed Savile Row fashion district . In the era of the robe and the toga , fine cloth made the man or woman .

There are no " right " ways to do things , only ways that please you . <p> In Fair Isle knitting , finding the value of the colors you want to use is more important than the actual hues . Value is how close a particular shade is to white or black . To find the value of a color , we suggest trying these tricks : <p> Scan yarn samples in black and white . <p> Take a picture of yarn samples and convert it to gray scale . <p> Or hold a red or green piece of cellophane over your yarns to cancel out their hues . <h> The Rules for Overcoming Color-Choice Fear <p> The sheer number of available colors can be overwhelming , so here are some important tips to get you going ( Excerpted from Fearless Fair Isle by Mary Jane Mucklestone , from Interweave Knits , Spring 2011 ) : <p> Choose your yarn colors in clear natural daylight . <p> Begin with a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a group of light colors and a group of dark colors . As we discussed above the most important aspect of each color is its value : its relative darkness or lightness . <p> Arrange each color group further in a value sequence from dark to light ( Figure 1 ) . <p> Choose three colors from each group : a darkest color , a medium color , and a lightest color ( Figure 2 ) . <p> Select a couple of crazy or odd colors you might want to use as occasional accents ( Figure 3 ) . Set them off to the side . Line up your choices next to each other . Is there enough contrast between the corresponding groups ? The darkest color of the light group should be lighter than the lightest color of the dark group . Designate one group as pattern colors and the other as background colors . <p> After you 've settled on your colors , give them a test run before swatching .

Two experts on spinning with a drop spindle , Maggie Casey and Abby Franquemont , have created great resources to help you learn how to handspin yarn and how to spin with a drop spindle in particular . Getting Started on A Drop Spindle and Respect the Spindle are filled with advice on all aspects of drop spindle spinning . <h> Choosing a Drop Spindle <p> " Your first drop spindle should weigh 2 to 3 ounces . Many beautiful lighter-weight spindles are available , but wait before you try one , because a medium-weight or heavier spindle will spin longer while you learn to draft out the fibers . Do n't  choose one that is too heavy , however , or you will learn why they are called drop spindles . A well-balanced spindle is a delight , so check to see how well yours spins " tie on some yarn and give it a clockwise twist . The spindle should turn smoothly without a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Maggie . <h> Low-whorl spindles <p> " Low-whorl spindles , with the weight at the bottom , have a low center of gravity and are more stable as a result . They tend to be forgiving of minor flaws in balance or shaping , so they 're easier to make . A heavy low-whorl spindle will spin better than a heavy high-whorl . A low-whorl spindle may or may not have a hook , notch , or other device to assist with keeping the spun yarn secured to the spindle while you spin the next length . If there is no notch or hook , a half-hitch knot is used to secure the stored yarn . The cop ( the yarn you 've already spun and wound on the spindle shaft ) is stored above the whorl , either snug against it or just farther up the shaft . Low-whorl spindles are most commonly set in motion with a finger flick , meaning you need only a small amount of shaft to grip to get it started and can pack a lot of spun yarn onto the spindle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " High-whorl spindles have the weight at the top . Extremely light high-whorl spindles tend to spin better than extremely light low-whorl spindles . Build the cop ( the mass of yarn wound onto the shaft after it is spun ) as close as possible to the whorl . High-whorl spindles get more top-heavy as they fill , with the spinning motion becoming irregular sooner than when spinning on a low-whorl spindle . Cops are also at somewhat greater risk of becoming unstable or slipping off a high-whorl spindle , meaning care must be taken when winding a cop . High-whorl spindles are often set in motion with a rolling movement . The shaft of the high-whorl spindle is commonly rolled up or down the thigh to set the spindle spinning ; this requires a greater length of shaft without yarn wound onto it . As a result , high-whorl spindles generally do n't  hold as much yarn in a single cop as low-whorl spindles do . " <h> Other Drop Spindle Spinning Characteristics <p> " Regardless of whorl placement , a major factor in spindle performance is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whorl ) or center-weighted ( with weight concentrated toward the shaft ) . <p> " A rim-weighted spindle will tend to spin longer , but at a slower speed ; a center-weighted spindle will tend to spin at a faster speed , but not for as long duration , and with greater variation of speed . If you want a spindle that spins fast " for fine spinning or for short-staple fibers such as cotton or animal downs " choose a center-weighted spindle . If you want a spindle that spins slower , but for a long time so you can spin thick yarn or spin very long lengths of yarn before winding on , you might prefer a rim-weighted spindle . <p> " If you want a very light spindle , a top-whorl spindle is probably going to perform better than a low-whorl spindle . If you 're figuring out how to make a drop spindle , a low-whorl spindle will probably be easier to make and get good performance from than a high-whorl spindle . If you want to pack lots of yarn onto a spindle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abby . <h> How to Use a Drop Spindle <p> Before using a drop spindle , practice drafting out the fibers . <p> Take a handful of wool in one hand and with the other hand , gently pull some of the fibers away from the mass and then add some twist by twisting the fibers in one direction between your fingers . This is the essence of spinning " drawing out the fibers and adding twist until you have created a stable yarn . Continue to pull out the fibers ( drafting ) and add more twist . If you do n't have enough twist , the yarn will fall apart . If you have too much twist , you wont be able to draw out the fibers from the drafting triangle . Spend a few minutes drafting out the fibers and adding twist " you will need to be able to maintain a comfortable rhythm when you start drop spindle spinning . <p> Take a piece of plied wool yarn about 18 inches long and tie it onto the spindle shaft as your leader . Top-whorl spindle : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and over the whorl , and catch it with the hook . Bottom-whorl spindle : Tie the leader above the whorl and then spiral the yarn up the spindle shaft . If your spindle has a hook rather than a groove , catch the yarn with it and you are ready to go . If you have a groove , you will have to make a half-hitch knot to hold the yarn to the spindle . <p> Start practicing with the spindle . Remember that most singles yarns are spun clockwise ( to the right ) . Most spinners hold the fiber in the left hand and the spindle in the right hand , but try both ways and see which feels comfortable to you . Hold the leader in one hand and with the other hand , give the spindle a twist . Practice until you can get the spindle to turn smoothly . <p> Once you are comfortable drafting out the fibers and twisting the spindle , put these actions together . Start by sitting down , because your lap will be a valuable tool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leader . With one hand , hold a handful of fiber and the leader together . With the other hand , twist the spindle clockwise . Watch the twist run up the leader and grab the fibers in your hand . Youve just made a join . ( You will do the same when you need to add more fiber to your spun yarn . ) <p> After you have made the join , twist the spindle and then stop it between your knees so it cant go backward . Slide your twisting hand above the spindle , pinch the leader , and draft out some fibers . Pinching the yarn keeps the twist from running up into the fiber source . The twisting/pinching hand keeps the twist under control while the fiber hand drafts out the fibers to the correct size . Once the yarn is the right size , open up the pinching hand and let the twist run up and stabilize the fibers you have just drafted . <p> Continue to twist the spindle , stop it in your lap by holding the shaft between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the yarn by how much you pull the fibers out . A few fibers make a fine yarn ; many fibers add bulk . If too much twist gets into the fiber , slide your fiber hand back a little , untwist the yarn in the opposite direction it was spun , and draft out more fiber before allowing the twist to move back into the yarn . <p> When the yarn is longer than your arm , its time to wind it onto the spindle . Keeping the yarn taut , wind it on the spindle clockwise and make a cone under the whorl on a top whorl and an upside-down cone on top of the bottom whorl . The neater you wind the yarn , the easier it will be to remove from the spindle . <p> After you feel comfortable spinning the spindle and stopping it on your lap , it is time to spin with the spindle suspended in the air . Continue to draft the fibers out the same way , but instead of stopping the spindle in your lap , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord and starts to twist counterclockwise , add more clockwise twist . If the spindle keeps going backward , the twist will come out of the yarn , it will turn it back into fluff , and the spindle will drop . <p> Soon you will have a spindle full of yarn . Now you can wind the yarn off the spindle and into a ball or skein.

One might also use a tea towel to cover a plate of baked goodies before serving . <p> These tea towels would be designed to match the rest of the table linens , and were often used as a vehicle for women to show off their embroidery skills .

Bake clay on parchment paper on cardboard or on a ceramic tile . Note that curing clay directly on metal will create shiny spots on it . Preheat the oven to 250- F first , and then cure your polymer clay pieces for 30 to 60 minutes between 250- and 265- F.

Metal jewelry making is n't limited to precious metals like gold , silver , and platinum , but can include a variety of both ferrous metals ( metals that include at least some iron ) and nonferrous metals ( metals that contain no iron ) , including copper , aluminum , steel , tin , titanium , and brass .

Finishing tasks can be completed by hand or by machine , or by a combination of the two . <p> Metalsmithing extras : At some point during the metal jewelry-making process , you might choose to embellish your metal designs by adding textures and patinas .

It is most commonly referred to as oxidizing , though that term is used erroneously , but just go with it " its got way too much stuff to do with chemistry to go into here . Most jewelers just call it oxidizing . <p> It gives gorgeous results on silver and copper ; I find it a bit more difficult to get a good patina on brass , and it has no effect on gold . Colors achieved with liver of sulfur can range from a golden yellow to dark gray/black . You control this with your application of the patina . <p> It comes in several forms : liquid , lump , and gel form . For years I used the lump form , and it works fine , but I have found the gel form much easier , with the same or even better results . My personal least favorite is the liquid form , and this is because when used in a classroom setting , students use way too much and it gets wasted . Plus , I do n't  think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other two forms . I have found that many people , even when using the lump form , make way too much solution . You only need the size of half of a green pea and about a quarter cup of water to make a good solution . <p> The newer liver of sulfur gel comes in several sizes . I 've really started to like the gel . <p> Liver of sulfur will deteriorate in sunlight , so if you make up a batch , keep it tightly covered and in a dark , cool place . Also , keep it away from tools and other acids , like pickle . <h> Liver of Sulfur Prep <p> First , the metal needs some " tooth . " A textured or lightly sanded finish works best . Liver of sulfur will work on a polished surface , but a surface finished with rouge to a high polish may take several applications and a lot of patience . A slight tooth , even with the 9- or 15-grit 3M Finishing Films , will work . The piece must be very clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and then rinse it . Then I do n't  touch the part I wish to patina . Also , get a #5 soft , round , medium-priced watercolor brush . No need to mess up a real pricey brush , but neither do you want to leave brush hairs all over your jewelry . That 's a really unfashionable look . Use the brush only for your liver of sulfur treatments . Also use rubber gloves , and try not to breathe the " stinky stuff . " Safety glasses are a must . You do n't  want this " stinky stuff " in your eyes . And keep away from food ! <h> Liver of Sulfur Application Techniques <p> Liver of sulfur accentuates texture on a piece , such as this Phantom Jasper and yellow sapphire pendants back plate , which was textured with Japanese watercolor paper . <p> There are as many opinions of how to apply LOS as there are jewelry artists . Basically , its whatever works for you " its not rocket science . Experiment , but here are some pointers . <p> Application depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , dissolve a tiny piece of LOS , either lump or gel , in a small glass container of cold water . As you apply the solution , it will go through stages of colors , from yellow to magenta to purple to dark blue . These changes can happen rapidly , so watch carefully . You may add a tiny bit of ammonia and a drop of liquid Dawn detergent to sometimes get more vivid colors . The addition of an everyday iron tablet ( yep just like the vitamin ) can give you a rich blue . When you get to the color you want , dip the piece immediately into cold water . That will help " set " the color . <p> Another application process is to run hot water over the piece and then either dip it into a small glass container of LOS or use the paintbrush to paint it on where you want it . This will give you a gray to black finish . <h> Finishing After Applying Liver of Sulfur <p> I really love the gunmetal color that liver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detergent . <p> To finish the process I use a soft brass brush ( not the one you clean your BBQ grill with ! ) and Dawn detergent ( is n't this stuff wonderful ! ) , which acts as a lubricant , to brush vigorously over the entire piece . This will even out the finish ( and also give a gunmetal look on silver jewelry that I find extremely attractive ) . If I want to remove more , I use a polishing cloth or a flex shaft with a muslin buff and some Zam or rouge . Sometimes I use three or four pink 3M bristle discs ( what I call spiders " who can say " 3M radial bristle discs " in class all the time ? ) stacked on a mandrel with a flex shaft on the areas I want highlighted . A light finishing film or a green kitchen scrubby with a little pumice and Dawn detergent will work too . An old kitchen scrubby that is not so stiff works best . ( Just do n't  use it for cleaning pots and pans after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color can be another matter . Here in Colorado this unprotected finish can last longer than it will in a humid or metropolitan area . But a light spraying with Krylon Low-Odor Clear Finish , available at most art supply stores , or even hairspray will work for a while , but it will wear off . Nikolas Lacquer has proven to work well but may need to be reapplied after several years wear . You could also use a clear powder coat , which may last forever . The powder-coated stuff I have has lasted for at least three years now . Its a bit more pricey . <p> These are my well-loved brass brushes with Lucite handles , and they give the perfect finish . The smaller metal-bristled paintbrush style gets into the smaller spaces with ease . <p> Anyway , have fun , experiment , and if you do n't  like the results , liver of sulfur can be removed by placing the item in warm pickle for a few hours , by sanding , with pink pumice spiders , or heating with a torch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Youll be amazed at what your knitwear looks like before and after blocking ! Read on to learn how to block knitting your projects like a pro . <h> Wet-Blocking the Simple Way <p> By definition , wet-blocking uses more moisture than steam-blocking knitting , and can be used to stretch and enlarge a knitted piece ( although loosely knitted pieces stretch more easily than tightly knitted ones , and any extra inches you gain in width , you may lose in length ) . There are three degrees of wet-blocking , depending on the amount of moisture added to the knitted fabric . <p> This the mildest form of wet-blocking . It works equally well for all fibers , although silks and synthetics require more wetness than wool . It allows for total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not restricted to the temperature and amount of steam that comes out of your iron , and you can gently pat and shape the piece with your hands while you work . Right side up , use pins to secure your handknit to shape on a padded surface placed away from direct sun or heat . Fill a spray bottle with cool tap water and spritz a fine , even mist over the piece . Use your hands to gently pat the moisture into the handknit , if desired , but be careful not to flatten any textured stitches . <h> Wet-Wrapping Techniques <p> This how to block knitting method imparts moisture deeper into the fibers and is appropriate for all types of yarn , especially cotton and acrylic , which are less resilient than wool and require more moisture penetration to reshape stitches . To wet-wrap , thoroughly soak a large bath towel in water and then put it through the spin cycle of a washing machine to remove excess moisture . Place the handknit on top of the towel , then roll the two together jelly-roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely damp , overnight if necessary . Unroll the towel , remove the handknit , and pin it out to measurements on a padded surface , such as a blocking mat , away from direct sun or heat . <h> Immersion Techniques <p> The immersion method imparts moisture thoroughly through the fibers and allows complete reshaping . It is appropriate for all fiber types , and particularly ideal for heavily ribbed or cabled fabrics , or fabrics that have taken on a biased slant during knitting . It is also the method to use after washing a handknit . To immerse a handknit , turn it inside out and soak it in a basin of lukewarm water for about 20 minutes , or until thoroughly wet , gently squeezing water through the piece if necessary . Drain the water , carry the wet handknit in a bundle to the washing machine , and put it through the spin cycle ( or roll it in dry towels ) to remove excess moisture . Do not twist or wring the handknit . Shape the piece right side up on a padded surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knitting as necessary . <h> Steam-Blocking Techniques <p> You can use steam from an iron or a steamer to block any handknit . Place the dry garment on a blocking board ( or the floor , a spare bed , a stack of towels , an ironing board " you get the message ! ) . Pin it to the desired measurements using rust-resistant pins and blocking wires for knitting if desired . Use the iron or steamer to apply steam to the garment ( but be careful not to apply steam while you 're working with the piece ! ) . <p> Hold the iron or steamer about an inch above the handknit , moving slowly to make sure the steam penetrates the fabric . If you 're using an iron , do not apply it directly to the garment ! It will crush the fabric , and it may harm acrylic blends and silk or bamboo fibers . If you 're using a steamer , you can place it on the fabric , but do n't  press down hard or you 'll get the same undesirable results as mentioned with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steamer to block my handknits . When I 'm using a steamer , I hold it above the fabric except on the selvage edge , which I want to lay flat . <h> Expert Tips on How to Block Knitting : <p> Experiment with blocking your gauge swatch before you block an actual knitted piece . <p> Do not rub , twist , or wring a handknit . Doing so may distort the stitches beyond correction . <p> Before blocking knitting , weave in all loose ends ; the blocking process will help secure the ends in place . <p> It is preferable to block individual pieces before sewing them together . Blocking makes the sewing process easier and the results of blocking are more consistent when you work with a single layer of fabric . You can block a garment that has been sewed together , but the results may not be as good . <p> Many experts warn against blocking ribbing , which will lose its natural elasticity if blocked while stretched open .

Do n't  press down ; keep the iron or the steamer just a little bit above the fabric . <p> Now that you know a few tried-and-true methods for how to block knitting , you can start experimenting with blocking techniques to find the ones that work best for your needs .

Crochet afghan patterns are simple in shape , a basic rectangle of crochet stitches , but modifying crocheted afghans can sometimes be anything but simple . With no fit and rarely any shaping , crochet afghans are a perfect blank canvas for learning or playing with new techniques such as cables , Tunisian crochet , motifs , and more . <p> There are three basic sizes for crochet blankets : afghan , lap blanket , and baby blanket . Traditionally , full-size , crochet afghan patterns measures about 50 ? by 65 ? . The lap blanket is about 35 ? by 40 ? . And the perennial favorite , the baby blanket , measures about 25 ? by 30 ? .

@@14363929 @2963929/ <h> How to Cable Knit Like a Pro with Eunny Jang <p> Learning how to cable knit is one technique that epitomizes the free hand we knitters have to shape and mold our fabric as it grows . All cables " the whole lot of them , from simple ropes to complex panels to eye-boggling allover fabrics " are really just stitches knitted out of order in a certain way , forcing the stitches to cross over one another . When combined with knit/purl texture , as cable knitting patterns usually are , some of the stitches appear to come forward , while others appear to recede , creating the illusion of individual " strands " that move across the surface of a plain fabric . <h> How to Cable Knit : The Basic Cable <p> The most familiar type of cable knitting pattern is a simple rope cable . A rope cable is worked over a set number of stitches that are ( usually ) worked in a straight column , without moving over background stitches to the right or left . <p> The actual cabling in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and usually while working a right-side row , half the strand stitches are placed out of sequence before knitting . Cable instructions and chart keys often direct you to do something like " place two stitches onto a cable needle , hold in front , knit two , knit two from the cable needle . " This means that you use a third , smaller cable needle to hold half the strands stitches out of the way , knit the former second half of the strand first , then knit the former first half of the strand . Doing so switches the order of the two halves , making them pass over one another and creating a cable knit crossing . <p> If you hold the first half of the stitches to the front of the work while you knit the second half , you will have a left cross ( see photo at left ) , where the first half of the cable passes over the second . <p> If you hold the first half of the stitches to the back of the work while knitting the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo at left ) , where the first half of the cable passes under the second . <p> Rope cables typically repeat the same cross direction over and over for a continuous twist that resembles a rope . <h> Working with Cables &amp; The Cable Knit Pattern <p> Cable knitting patterns are usually planned with an orderly structure , crossing and moving strands at predictable intervals . Multi-stitch cables are almost always crossed only on right-side rows , with wrong-side rows worked with the stitches as they appear . <p> If you 've lost track of where you are in a cable repeat , its easy to count the number of rounds or rows since your last crossing ( see the photo at right on counting rows ) . Pull a cable apart gently to see where the out-of order stitches of the last crossing are knitted and joined to their new neighbors .

Work up to the point of the offending crossing and then drop only the involved stitches from your needle . ( If the error involves strands that have since separated , this point may be several stitches away from the original crossing point . The stitches in each strand stay with it throughout the knitting , meaning that you must drop from wherever the original strands stitches have ended up . ) Ladder the dropped stitches down until you reach the held stitches .

Wealthy families like the Medici patronized silk weavers and commissioned elaborate velvet cloth decorated with their family crest . Other common motifs , such as pomegranates , were steeped in religious significance . <p> These velvets , woven from pure silk , dyed deep , royal colors , embellished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and uncut sections of pile , sent a clear message . One look at the richly shifting colors , the luxurious texture , and the elaborate decoration made it clear that this was fabric fit to adorn a king , well out of reach for the poor or even the middle class .

But there 's still something magical about weaving it by hand . Deb Essen 's technique allows you to do so without the need for a special loom with a supplemental warp beam .

After all , I went to art school and he- to engineering school . <p> As a knitting illustrator , I was fortunate enough to be able to combine two loves : drawing and knitting . But looking back , - I can see that my interest has always been in the mechanics of knitting , more than anything else. - I want to understand how- knitting works . In order to make the most accurate drawings , I 've had to knit and dissect hundreds of swatches . And after years of scrutinizing knitted stitches , Ive come to a deep understanding of the elements that make up the structure of the knitted fabric. - And sometimes this understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting projects . <p> Not long ago , - I was working on a cowl that required grafting two circular pieces together . Usually , when instructions tell you to graft stitches , they 're referring to the grafting most commonly used to graft the toes of socks . But the set-up of the stitches was completely different from that of sock toes , so why use the same grafting technique ? <p> For example , when you knit circularly , you are actually creating a spiral . When you graft the toes of socks , you are joining one half of the spiral to the other half ( illustration 1 ) . <p> Illustration 1 . <p> But with- the cowl , I needed to join two separate spirals ( illustration 2 ) . <p> Illustration 2 . <p> In the illustrations , I made the circular pieces different colors so that it would be easier to tell them apart . I 've also drawn the pieces off the needles to make it easier to see what 's happening with the stitches . The green piece represents the stitches on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue piece represents the stitches on the back needle ( BN ) . The grafted row ( shown in dark green in illustration 3 ) forms- another spiraled row between the two pieces . <p> Illustration 3 . <p> Cut the yarn on the FN stitches , leaving a tail about four times the circumference of the piece , and use this for the grafting . The tail coming from- the BN stitches should be long enough that it can be woven in , but not so long that it- gets in the way when you 're grafting . ( In illustration 4 , Ive drawn the tails shorter than they actually are so that they do n't  obscure the stitches . ) <p> Illustration 4 . <p> Illustration 5 . <p> Place a removable marker in the stitch in the row below the last stitch of the round on the BN stitches ( marked with an asterisk in the illustrations ) . This stitch will come into play at the end of the grafting . <p> Hold the circular needles together , - holding the piece with the longer tail- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle and follow these steps ( illustration 5 ) : <h> Step 1 <p> Insert the tapestry needle purlwise ( from WS to RS ) into the first stitch on the FN , pull the yarn through , leaving the stitch on the knitting needle . <h> Step 2 <p> Insert the tapestry needle purlwise ( from RS to WS ) into the first stitch on the BN , remove the stitch from the knitting needle but do n't  pull the yarn through ; just leave it on the tapestry needle until the next step . <h> Step 3 <p> Insert the tapestry needle knitwise ( from WS to RS ) into the next stitch on the BN , pull the yarn through , leaving the stitch on the knitting needle . <h> Step 4 <p> Insert the tapestry needle knitwise ( from RS to WS ) into the first stitch on the FN , remove the stitch from the knitting needle but do n't  pull the yarn through ; just leave it on the tapestry needle until the next step . <p> One knit stitch has been grafted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Repeat Steps 1 " 4 for every knit stitch around ( illustration 6 ) until you have one stitch remaining on each needle . <p> Illustration 6 . <p> Place a removable marker in the stitch on the FN , then remove- the stitch- from the needle ( you need to secure it first with the marker or it will unravel ) . Place a marker in the stitch on the BN and remove the stitch from the needle . This stitch wont unravel because the yarn has already passed through it once in Step 3 of the previous grafted stitch , but the marker will help to identify it in the next step . <p> On the BN stitches , remove the tail from the stitch marked by the asterisk ( illustration 7 ) . <p> Illustration 7 . <p> Then with the tapestry needle and grafting yarn , go purlwise ( from WS to RS ) through the FN stitch , removing the marker ; purlwise ( from RS to WS ) through the BN stitch , removing the marker ; knitwise ( from WS to RS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marker ; and knitwise ( from RS to WS ) through the FN stitch . <p> The grafted row is now complete ( illustration 8 ) . <p> Illustration 8 . <p> To weave in the tails , I work duplicate stitch over a couple of stitches , taking each tail to the opposite side of the gap , then run the tail through to the inside of the tube. - <p> What Ive described above is top-to-top grafting , or grafting the last round of one piece to the last round of another piece . But if- you are grafting the last round of one- piece to the provisional cast-on of another piece , you must first create a stitch with the cast-on tail as shown in illustrations 9 and 10. - The stitch created by the cast-on tail will be the same as the last stitch of the round in the top-to-top grafting example ( compare illustrations 4 and 10 ) . <p> By the way , if you are grafting in a ribbing pattern to a provisional cast-on row , simply substitute " knitwise " for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every purl stitch .

@@14363941 @2963941/ <h> How to Entrelac Knit : Entrelac Knitting is Easier Than You Think <p> Entrelac knitting is a great knitting technique to know as it produces a fabric with a woven appearance " tiers of tilting blocks appear to run over and under each other . But the fabric is actually worked all in one piece as a series of interconnecting rectangles . Also called patchwork knitting , basketweave knitting , or birch-bark patterning , entrelac can stand on its own in garter or stockinette stitch , or it can provide an interesting framework for other texture or colorwork techniques . <h> How to Knit Entrelac : Flat Knitting <p> Basic principles : Entrelac fabrics series of tilted blocks are worked one at a time in tiers . Within a tier , blocks are worked in the same direction , either right to left or left to right . Each tier of blocks builds upon the one below it . Individual blocks are worked by picking up stitches along the selvedge of a block from the tier below and working stitches of the growing block together with live stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To produce a piece with straight rather than pointed edges across the bottom and top , the first and last tiers must consist of rows of triangular half-blocks . For straight vertical edges , every other tier of a flatworked entrelac piece begins and ends with a triangle . <p> Individual blocks may be worked over any number of stitches , and a piece may have any number of individual blocks . In all cases , each block contains twice as many rows as it does stitches . When you practice knitting entrelac for the first time , try working every other tier of blocks in a different color to emphasize the basketweave effect and make it easier to identify the blocks and live stitches of each tier . Note : When you work the first stitch of every row , you can slip it for a tidy pick-up edge , but be aware that you will lose some elasticity in the knitted piece . <p> Ready to dive right into entrelac knitting instructions ? If you 're intrigued by this popular technique and want to know more , you 'll love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode of Knitting Daily TV . Episode 503 features a quick tutorial with knitting expert Eunny Jang on this technique , then goes on to talk about other techniques and ideas for using color playfully and unexpectedly in your projects . Discover the basics with this entrelac knitting tutorial . <h> What 's the entrelac knit going to look like ? <p> Though the basic entrelac technique has several variations , the following method well look at produces tidy results . This information was adapted from an article by Eunny Jang from Interweave Knits , Spring 2007 . Spring 2007 features the full entrelac tutorial and entrelac pattern we discuss below , plus a beautiful entrelac sock pattern and 20 other knitting patterns . <h> Base triangles <p> This example starts with 24 stitches to be worked in three groups of 8 , using the knitted cast-on so that stitches are loose enough to work with . Triangles are knit one at a time , and once the first has been completed , the right selvedge edge of the just-worked triangle forms the right side of the triangle , the live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast-on row forms the base . Repeating the process of triangle 1 until all cast-on stitches have been worked , there will be three 8-stitch triangles on the needle . Figure 1 shows the results of this first tier . <h> First Tier of Blocks <p> This tier and every other tier of blocks moving forward begins and ends with a half-block , or side triangle , at each edge to maintain a straight selvedge . The live stitches from each base triangle are joined to the growing blocks of the new tier by working the last stitch of the new block on WS rows together with a live stitch from a block in the previous tier . Tip : If you 're changing color on this row , purl the first stitch with both strands of yarn to secure them , then snip the old color . <p> Note : All figures show knitting with needle removed . <p> After the first side triangle is completed , the process continues with the row blocks , picking up stitches along the selvedge of the triangle now on the needles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle . To end this tier a second side triangle is worked , finishing with 25 stitches total , two full blocks of 8 stitches each , one first side triangle of 8 stitches , one second side triangle of 1 stitch . Figure 2 shows our work at this point . <h> Second Tier of Blocks <p> This tier consists of all full blocks and is worked following a first tier of blocks . To begin this row pick up and knit stitches along the selvedge now between the needles , picking up from tip to base of the block from the previous row . Note : The stitch remaining on the needle from the side triangle counted as the first picked-up stitch , so only pick up and knit 7 stitches to have 8 stitches for working the first block . <p> Each block is worked individually before moving onto to complete the second and third blocks for this tier . What you 'll end up with is the number of stitches you casted-on ( in our example 24 ) and full blocks of 8 stitches each . Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two previous tiers can be repeated as many times as desired , ending by completing the tier that begins and ends with side triangles . <h> Finishing Method 1 : Top Triangles <p> To finish , pick up and knit stitches along the selvedge now between the needle , taking care to pick up stitches from tip to base of the blocks from the previous tier . Note : As before , the stitch remaining on the needle from the previous triangle counts as your first picked-up stitch , so pick up and knit only 7 stitches to have 8 stitches for working each top triangle . <p> After the first triangle has been completed , 1 stitch remains on the right needle . If you started with 24 cast-on stitches as we did , you 'll repeat twice more to complete the second and third top triangles " 1 stitch remains . Cut yarn and pull through last stitch on needle to fasten off . Figure 4 demonstrates the finished piece . <p> There is a variation you can use for continuing into another pattern stitch rather than ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the last tier of triangles is worked to create a straight horizontal line of live stitches at the top of the entrelac section . Its important to note that because the entrelac blocks lie on the diagonal , the number of stitches along an edge of an entrelac piece does n't  make an edge of the same length as knitting . Therefore , there will be a need to increase stitches on the following row to the number needed to produce a piece the same width as the entrelac section . <p> The basic entrelac instructions we just covered are just the tip of the iceberg for entrelac knitting . Understanding the fundamentals of entrelac is key to success working all sorts of patterns .

Working the first row of stitches into the foundation chain is a fiddly , clumsy task , and you have to be pretty exact on your chain count . Many times I would reach the end of the first row only to discover I had either run out of chains before I had worked enough stitches or I had extra chains . If this has happened to you , do you frog everything , try to work an extra stitch or two in the last chain or attempt to disguise the extra chains with a decrease stitch ? With foundation stitches you work the foundation chain and the first row 's stitch in one step ! <p> Even better , your project is easier to hold and the stitches are easier to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the number of stitches you need . No accidently skipping a chain or working two stitches into one chain because you ca n't differentiate the loops . Best of all , this first row is slightly stretchy , without the tightness that can develop with a base chain alone . I have used this technique on many patterns , including the Big Bow Cardigan by Julia Vaconsin ( Interweave Crochet Winter 2008 ) , which I 'm modeling above . <h> How to Crochet Foundation Rows <p> To work a foundation single crochet , begin with a slipknot on hook , chain 2 ( Figure 1 ) , insert hook in 2nd chain from the hook , pull up a loop , yarn over , draw through 1 loop ( this loop is the next " chain , " Figure 2 ) , yarn over and draw through 2 loops ( this is the single crochet ) you now have 1 sc with its own ch st ( shaded ) at the bottom ( Figure 3 ) , *insert hook under the 2 loops of the " ch " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a loop , yarn over and draw through 1 loop , yarn over and draw through 2 loops ; repeat from * for as many foundation single crochets as you need ( Figure 5 ) . <p> The extra stretch of foundation stitches is especially helpful for patterns that need a lot of stretch like socks or pullovers . I would also use a foundation single crochet on a project such as the Seafoam Vest ( below ) where the foundation chain needs to fit comfortably at the hip . <p> Seafoam Vest ( Spring 2007 ) <h> Things to Remember When Crocheting a Foundation Row <p> There are a few tips to keep in mind when substituting a foundation row for a chain row . <p> When working a regular chain row and then a row of single crochet , you end the single crochet row by working in the first chain you worked . When working the foundation single crochet you will finish on the end opposite the first " chain " . <p> Pretty Pleats Skirt ( Spring 2009 ) <p> Some patterns , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end by working in the first chain because of shaping or the stitch pattern . For garments such as these , simply work your foundation row , fasten off , and rejoin your yarn at the opposite end of the row . <p> When a pattern would benefit from a foundation with more stretch but the first row is not a simple stitch such as a single or double crochet , you can work a foundation single crochet row , then work into that row as you would the chain . Very little extra length is added and in some patterns , the extra stretch is worth the slight height addition . <p> When substituting a foundation chain with a foundation single or double crochet , work the number of stitches given for the first row not the number given for the foundation chain . <p> Grab a scrap of yarn or your latest " must make " garment and give foundation stitches a try . They are so easy to master that when I teach people to crochet , I use a foundation stitch rather than a foundation chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millers article " Getting into the Loop : Foundation Stitches " in the Interweave Crochet Spring 2007 issue . I love how you can find informative articles and must make patterns in every issue . I would recommend getting your hands on a year of our award winning crochet magazine .

Unmercerized Cotton : What 's the Difference ? <p> Can you please explain why so many weaving patterns for towels call for unmercerized cotton , whereas other items like mats and runners usually call for mercerized ? I have woven with mercerized cotton and enjoy it ( for towels and other items ) , but havent found a clear explanation why one would choose one of these two types of cotton yarn over the other . <p> If you were to look at all the projects that have ever appeared in Handwoven , my guess is that the majority would be woven in mercerized cotton . This is at least partly because mercerized cotton yarns , usually called pearl cottons , are more available than almost any other yarn for weaving . They are made by several US manufacturers in a huge range of colors in 3/2 , 5/2 , 10/2 , and 20/2 sizes and are available from almost all weaving retailers . The most common size of unmercerized cotton ( also in a wide range of colors ) is 8/2. 16/2 unmercerized cotton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many colors ; both 8/2 and 16/2 are available from many weaving retailers . ( 10/2 unmercerized cotton is currently only available undyed , as far as I know . ) <p> Similarly-colored towels woven in unmercerized 8/2 cotton , which means the colors are slightly less saturated , but the absorbency is greater . Learn more in the eBook A Dozen Projects in 8/2 Cotton ! <p> Both 10/2 pearl cotton ( 4,200 yd/lb ) and 8/2 unmercerized cotton ( 3,360 yd/lb ) are good yarn thicknesses for weaving placemats , runners , and towels ( the items probably most frequently made by handweavers ) . The differences between the two types of cotton yarn ( in addition to a small difference in thickness ) are related to their relative absorbency . Pearl cottons absorb dyes better and therefore show more saturated hues ; mercerization also provides a sheen that tends to intensify color . Unmercerized cotton yarns are duller in color and more matte in texture . They absorb water better , however , which makes them a good choice for towels . This is probably the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have found that repeated washings tend to increase the absorbency of towels woven in 10/2 pearl cotton .

The Mixtec spin and weave with native cotton , mostly white and natural browns . They dye their cotton with cochineal and other native plants , but the finest pozahuancos were traditionally made and worn for weddings , and they were dyed purple with purpura dye , secretions from a snail that lives on the rocky coast . <p> I traveled to Oaxaca a few years ago with the staff of fair trade organization Clothroads and friends , and we had the opportunity to visit a weaving cooperative in the village of Pinotepa de Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pozahuancos using patterns handed down since pre-Columbian times .

Mixed-media jewelry artists enjoy creating small collages in bezels and preserving them under resin .

Do you want it to cure fast or slow ? You can get it either way . <p> Clarity : How clear will your resin be when its cured ? Or will it yellow ? <p> Doming : Will it dome well ? Is it self-leveling ? <p> Bubbling : Is it more prone to bubble than other resins ? <p> Surface : Does this resin cure hard and shiny on the surface ? Or will it remain tacky ? <p> Fumes : Most resins are practically or entirely fume-free and non-toxic . Do your research , especially if children or childrens jewelry is involved . <h> Quick Resin Jewelry Tutorial <p> Seal : Before embedding paper , fabric , or other porous ephemera in resin , you must seal it with a sealant ( such as Mod Podge ) .

I do n't wear a scarf either for warmth or as an accessory so experience does n't help me . I ca n't guess if the wearer is going to wrap it once around her neck , tie it or leave it loose . I know there are several considerations ; function , yarn , hand etc. but how to decide ? I have looked at many projects in Handwoven , and the length varies from 56 inches to 84 . Is there some kind of guideline for scarf length ? And how do I decide the length of the fringe ? <p> I would love your thoughts . Sylvia <p> Hi Sylvia ! There are several issues related to scarf length , but no real rules . A " rule of thumb " that I heard long ago is that a scarf should be as long as the person wearing it is tall . I 'm thinking that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say ) that you put around your neck and let hang . This rule of thumb on scarf length provides that the ends of the scarf will fall just below your hips . ( This would be the kind of scarf that is a lightweight , decorative accessory , rather than one intended to provide warmth . ) If you averaged all the scarf projects in Handwoven ( most of these would fall into the decorative accessory category ) , I bet the average width would be 8 " , the average scarf length about 65 " , and the average fringe length about 6 " . <p> However , these measurements depend on how you wear the scarf . If you want to form a loop in one end of the scarf through which you put the other two ends to make a sort of larks ' head knot around your neck , you might want the scarf to be longer , depending on how far down the front you want the scarf 's ends to fall . Jennifer Moore 's variation of interweaving the ends of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her scarf ) would probably work best with a scarf a bit longer than 65 " , also , again depending on where you want the ends to fall at the front . Scarves that are intended to provide warmth are often wider and bulkier . ( It would be interesting to have a discussion with the topic of : When does a scarf become a shawl ? ) A wide scarf ( 10 " or more ) , especially if woven with thick yarns , would not work so well in loops or knots , but might be wound around the neck once for warmth . A long , wide scarf ( say 12 " by 70 " ) could be worn around the neck or around the shoulders , therefore serving as a shawl . These would most likely be woven in wool ( either fine wools or heavy wools ) , and how they feel is as important as how they look . For wide scarves , proportion matters a bit . You would n't want a very wide but short scarf . <p> I took all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widths . I do n't think I 've ever had a rule I followed , but they are all about 8-10 " wide , 60-65 " long , with 5-6 " fringe . They are also all in lightweight yarns . The length of the fringe depends a bit on the yarns you are twisting and the thickness of each fringe . In silks , I tend to twist the fringe to be about 6 " , and the bouts are not very thick . In wools , with a thickish fringe ( like a pencil ? ) , I like how they look if they are shorter . But I think these are all personal preferences . <p> If you are weaving scarves for sale , you ca n't really know the personal preferences of the buyer , so in lightweight silks and cottons , I 'd go for those average measurements .

There to see the west-coast premiere of Handmade Nation , the documentary about the indie craft movement , I ended up enjoying the best crafty weekend in the history of my life . After touring around some crafty hotspots around the city , eating fabulous meals with amazing people , seeing the film and talking long about it , we converged on the warmly welcoming home of Susan Beal to spend a few hours chilling out and making stuff involving double crochet . <p> Over the course of the afternoon , Sister Diane from Craftypod and I taught Rachel , AKA Average Jane Crafter , how to crochet . And Rachel asked the same questions every single beginner crocheter has ever asked me . See , we started Rachel off making a granny square , and after that proved a frustrating first project , I set her up simply making double crochet in rows . By the end of the afternoon , I was wondering something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth do we start brand-new crocheters out with a double crochet stitch ? When you 're not yet familiar with what stitches look like and how to count them , why do we start them on a stitch that requires skipping at the beginning of a row , and working into a turning chain at the end ? This , people , is a dumb thing we experienced crocheters do . We should stop . <p> But until we do , I hope these double crochet instructions will help out new crocheters who are struggling despite assurances that crochet is easy as pie . Sometimes pie can be a great confounding mystery . Let 's set you on a path to evening those edges out , ok ? ( Note : You can click on any photo for an option to see a larger size . ) <p> Image 1 : Heres what it looks like as you approach the end of a row of double crochet .

The arrow is still indicating the top of the turning chain . <p> Image 4 : I 've finished the stitch and the arrow is on pointing to the top of the turning chain . See how easy it would be to skip it ? After all , it sort of looks like the edge could straighten out after a little tugging . Alas , though , it wo n't . <p> Image 5 : Ok , no more arrow .

It can be tight and/or awkward to shove your hook in there , but persistence will pay off . <p> Image 6 : I 've pulled up a loop in the top of the turning chain . Its pretty apparent now that we need to work a stitch here to make the edge straight , eh ? <p> Image 7 : Heres the completed final stitch of the row . There 's nothing to the left of it to stick my hook in , so I 'm confident it really is the end of the row . <p> Image 8 : Now we say to " turn your work . " This means to flip it around so your hook is poised to start the next row ( in these photos I 'm working right-handed , so at the beginning of a row my hook is on the right .

This is the " turning chain " which serves the function of raising the hook to the height of the stitches you 'll be making . Since double crochet is a fairly tall stitch , most patterns say to " count the turning chain as the first stitch of the row . " This is because that turning chain takes up about as much space as a double crochet . Since were counting it as the first stitch , we work the first actual double crochet into the second stitch of the row , not the first . ( If we work it into the first stitch , the edge will bulge out and look wonky . ) The arrow is keeping track of that first stitch that were going to skip before making the first double crochet . <p> Image 10 : This might be a confusing photo .

At the very right , you can pick out the chains of the turning chain ; see how they 're pretty much rising from that first stitch ? That 's why we skip it before working the first double crochet . <p> Image 12 : I 've completed the double crochet and the arrow is still indicating the first stitch from the previous row . So even though Ive only worked one double crochet , you can see it looks like we actually have two stitches made . This is why we count the turning chain as a full-on stitch . <p> Its entirely possible that my familiarity with crochet has prevented me from really getting to the heart of any confusion you might have .

The horizontal kind might be the most familiarmany of us learned on this type as Girl Scouts : <p> But there are so many other great looms now , too , including the vertical Mirrix loom that makes it really easy to make large-format pieces ; the Ricks loom , which leaves you with only two warp threads ; and the Jewel Loom , a portable loom that you can put in your notebook when you are n't  using it ! <p> Jennifer Van Benschoten had some great tips about loomwork when she wrote about her Mirrix loom a while back . These points are applicable to any type of loomwork . <p> 1 . Why weave beads on a loom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when you use square stitch , but the actual weaving goes much faster . Using a loom for weaving beads also makes it easier to adjust the tension in the beadwork , something that many beginners find difficult when working in square stitch . <p> 2 . What type of thread is best for bead-weaving on a loom ? Thread choice is always personal , depending on what kind of bead loom you 're using and what kind of beading project you 're creating . Claudia and Elena of Mirrix Looms prefer the C-Lon beading thread because its strong , comes in a wide range of colors , and holds up without fraying . I prefer to use my favorite Nymo D on a cone or spool ( not a bobbin ) for many of the same reasons . If you 're creating a piece like an evening bag or something else that needs to hold its shape , you may want to experiment with using Fireline or WildFire beading threads . <p> 3 .

Yes , you read that correctly . I mean , do n't get me wrong . Sure , I was a little bit disappointed that I had lost in round one , but I was thrilled to know that it was such a close competition . <p> I had my reservations going into this competition . I had n't made a " major " piece of beadwork or beaded jewelry since I had my son back in 2008 , and I had n't entered any kind of jewelry making competition since 2006 . But I wanted to enter this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wanted to push myself to create something entirely new . <p> I also learned a few things about entering jewelry making competitions that really changed the way I view these things , and I hope maybe a budding beaded jewelry designer can learn something about entering jewelry making competitions , too . <p> 1 . Just because your beautiful piece of beaded jewelry did n't win , it means your work is awful , worthless , or not good enough . This is a hard one for a lot of artists , because I think that most people equate artistic success with commercial success . However , that 's not always the case . There are many , many beautiful pieces of art that do n't make it into juried art shows or jewelry making competitions , but that does n't make them bad pieces of art . It just means that those particular judges did n't like them . And , really if you ask ten different people their opinion on the same piece of art , chances are that you are going to get ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to lose , do n't enter a competition . I know , it 's so easy to get wrapped up in the fantasy of entering a jewelry making competition and having your piece of beaded jewelry win top honors . But entering a jewelry making competition does n't guarantee that you 'll win anything . What it does guarantee , however , is that you will get your name and your work in front of a panel of professional judges , and sometimes , just getting your name out there at first can be more valuable than winning any prize . <p> 3 . Jewelry making competitions are harmful to your artistic development . This is one hot topic , and one that I will be exploring further in the coming weeks , but personally , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with a little healthy competition , even in the beading and jewelry making world . Jewelry making competitions are there to inspire artists , and I felt a great sense of accomplishment on finishing my bead embroidered collar for The Battle of the Beadsmith competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round ! <p> Davinia , by Australian bead artist Patrick Duggan , was another amazing piece of beadwork that did n't make it into Round 2 of The Battle of the Beadsmith . <p> Of course , being an artist means that you 're probably a little more sensitive to the opinions and criticisms about your work . I do n't mean to say that you should n't pay attention when someone has something critical to say about your beaded jewelery designs . But learning how to recognize what is truly constructive criticism and what is just someone 's opinion is an important part of being an artist . <p> I also do n't want to discourage anyone from entering their work in a jewelry competition , either . But do it with your eyes open and with the knowledge in your heart that no matter what the results of the competition , yes , you are good enough ! 
@@14363987 @2963987/ <h> Meet My Micro Torches , Blazer and Max Flame <p> I have two torches that belong to the butane micro torch family . Both are durable , high powered , and specifically geared for jewelry making . I have put both of these torches " through the wringer " so to speak . They have been in constant use in the classroom and on my workbench for more than five years and are still as good as new . <p> My Blazer torch is the first butane micro torch I ever purchased that actually worked well for jewelry . I found out the hard way that with butane torches , you really get what you pay for . When you are shopping for a butane torch , take a good look at it . Is it mostly plastic with a minimum of metal parts ? If so , put it back on the shelf , regardless of the great bargain it might seem . Torches that are kept on for an extended length of time ( during the soldering process ) get hot . That heat centers around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much plastic and you may find that your torch head may melt slightly , and that will affect the delivery of the butane to the torch tip , making the torch impossible to light . ( Ask me how I know ! ) Torches that are mostly metal can be used for extended periods of time without fear of damage in this way . <p> My other micro torch is my Max Flame torch. - The flame on my Max Flame torch is wider and longer ; - that means that I can solder bigger pieces with the Max Flame torch than with the Blazer . <h> Blazer vs Max Flame Micro Torch : When to Use Each One <p> So you may be wondering , " What exactly do I use each torch for ?

I use regular butane fuel that I get from the hardware store . You may have heard that it is best to use " triple-refined " fuel to keep your torch head clean , but honestly most of the time I use regular fuel right off the shelf , and my torches work great . This is not an endorsement , just my experience . <p> Filling the torch can be one of the " scary moments " with a butane torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk in the park . <p> Grab your micro torch and butane canister and go outside ( You want to have adequate ventilation when you are filling the torch ) . <p> If your torch has a stand at the bottom that can be removed , go ahead and take it off and put it aside . <p> Remove the cap from the butane . <p> Turn the torch upside down . You 'll see a filling point on the bottom of the torch . Insert the tip of the butane canister and press down firmly . <p> The butane will flow from the canister into the torch . If you hear fuel escaping out the torch head during filling , stop and tighten the knob that regulates the butane flow . I fill the torch until the butane makes a slight spitting noise at the filling point ( about a 10 count ) . Then I replace the stand on the micro torch , stand it upright , and let the butane settle for about 30 seconds or so . I store my butane canister out of the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Micro Torch <p> Consult the directions that came with your particular torch for directions on how to turn on your exact torch , but there are some basic concepts that apply to all micro butane torches:Cover your workspace with a fireproof surface ( a jelly-roll pan works well ) and put on a pair of safety glasses before turning on your torch . Point the head of the torch about 8 to 10 inches above that surface at a 45-degree angle and turn on the torch by starting the butane flow and clicking the ignition button . Adjust the flame to its highest point then to its lowest ( usually a lever or knob ) to get the feel of the size of the flame . I usually keep my flame at the highest point . <h> Understanding the Flame <p> Now examine the flame itself . ( Sometimes its best to view it under dimmed light . ) You 'll see an inner and outer flame . The outer flame is a dark transparent blue . The inner flame is lighter and more opaque in color and comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of that lighter flame is the " sweet spot " or the hottest part of the flame and the point to quickly heat metal and flow solder .

If you move the flame too close to the surface though , you 'll hear a sound that resembles wind or a slight hiss and see a dark spot in the middle of the heated metal . You have gone beyond the sweet spot of the flame . The inside part of the inner flame is cooler , which means soldering jewelry will take longer . <p> After you 're done examining the flame , turn the torch off . Place the torch upright on the fireproof surface . Remember that the tip will be hot , so point it away from you . <p> Congratulations !

@@14363988 @2963988/ <p> Have you heard about acrostic jewelry ? I learned about it watching an old episode of Antiques Roadshow UK a couple of weeks ago , and now I 'm fascinated by it . Just what I neededa new reason to be hooked on gemstones ! <p> The lovely old acrostic key brooch I saw on Antiques Roadshow . Can you read the message in these gems ? <p> What is Acrostic Jewelry ? <p> Acrostic jewelry is jewelry set with gemstones that spell out a message . Each gemstone represents a letterthe first letter of their nameand they were used like a sparkly alphabet to create messages of love and romance in jewelry . For example , popular gemstones such as diamond would serve as a D , rubies as an R , emeralds as an E , and so on . So if you wanted to spell out " dear , " you 'd create a piece of gemstone jewelry that featured a diamond , an emerald , an amethyst , and a ruby , in that order . Sweet , is n't it ? <p> Acrostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century Paris by Jean-Baptiste Mellerio , jeweler to Empress Josephine and Marie Antoinette , acrostic jewelry soon became a hit in nearby England .

They were also all about romance , secrecy , amusements , hidden meanings , games of the heart . <p> Most acrostic jewelry at the time was rings set with stones that spelled out the names of loved ones . According to the expert on Antiques Roadshow , in addition to names and romantic words like " dear , " other popular words in English acrostic jewelry were " regards " LONG ... and " dearest " LONG ... and " friend " LONG ... Two popular terms in French acrostic jewelry were " souvenir " ( French for " remembrance " ) and " amitiT " ( French for " friendship " ) . <p> *My research tells me that the I gemstone is iris ( in French ) , but I ca n't find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've spelled here in gems ?

" Lapis lazuli ( or labradorite ) , opal , something that starts with a V , and then emerald . . . but what common gemstone starts with a V ? Having started in France , however , early acrostic jewelry used the word " amour " much easier to spell out in gems than the English " love . " But then you have to consider that the French words were spelled using gemstones that also had French names , which adds a whole new layer of complexity to it , even though many gemstone names were the same or nearly the same in both languages . It does make that V easier , however , as hessonite garnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Language of Gemstones <p> Naturally being the pearl lover that I am , I 've started thinking of all the sweet words that have a P in them .

The name of one 's beloved was a popular choice in rings , so much so that a gentleman ( who by then had nearly stopped wearing flamboyant jewelry ) might give his special girl a nickname if her name was too long to be worn on a ring , as bracelets and brooches for men had fallen out of fashion .

How important do you suppose it was to the Victorians that the average observer knew what the gemstones in their jewelry spelled ?

For the letters that had no associated gemstone at the time , industrious English jewelers resorted to using colors of other gems to fill in the gaps ( fire opal for F , for example ) . If a piece of acrostic jewelry ended up with too many such substitutions , it could be nearly impossible for average onlookers to decipher the jewelry 's meaningthe secrecy of which only added to the popularity of acrostic jewelry . <p> The Gemstone Alphabet <p> Here 's a list of gemstones for the alphabet , off the top of my headthere are others that are less common .

@@14363990 @2963990/ <p> The debate rages among beaders as to which beading thread is the " best . " Are you a fan of nylon beading threads , or have you cross over to the gel-spun fishing line-type threads ? I 've heard passionate discourse from both camps as to which type of beading thread they prefer for bead weaving or bead embroidery patterns . Of course , your beading thread is a very important part of your bead weaving projects . Without it , how else would you connect your beads or attach them to your bead embroidery medium ? ( Glue does n't  count as an answer here , either ! ) <h> Two most common types of beading thread used in bead weaving : <h> Nylon Beading Threads <p> This is the type of beading thread I got started with when I was learning how to bead . Nymo is by far the most popular and widely available nylon beading thread available , and from what Ive seen , you either love it or you hate it for bead weaving . There does n't  seem to be a middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , multi-strand threads that were originally developed for the garment and upholstery industries . You can find nylon beading threads sold under brand names like Nymo , Silamide , K-O , and S-Lon . <p> What are the advantages of using nylon beading threads ? Nylon beading threads for bead weaving are easy to find in most local bead shops and online . They come in a wide range of colors and thicknesses , and are inexpensive ; usually in the range of one to four dollars for a large spool . Cutting a nylon beading thread is easy to do using a good pair of embroidery scissors , so no special thread cutters are necessary . <p> Nylon beading threads create bead weaving that feels like a supple fabric , so they are perfect for off-loom beading stitches like right-angle weave , herringbone stitch , and square stitch . The thinner nylon beading threads work well with beading stitches that require more than one pass through each bead . <p> What are the disadvantages of using nylon beading threads ? Because they are made up of multiple strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads when bead weaving with nylon beading thread . A split thread is a weak thread , and that can create a hole in your bead work , or worse yet , cause your piece to fall apart . To prevent splitting threads , always hold your beading thread to the top of your beads while passing your needle through the bottom . <p> Nylon beading threads ( except for Silamide , which is a pre-waxed beading thread ) should also be conditioned with thread conditioner before you start to stitch . Using a thread conditioner like microcrystalline beeswax prevents tangles and knots and makes your thread a little more waterproof . <h> Bonded Beading Threads <p> Bonded beading threads have taken over the bead thread market in the last few years . These types of threads are also known as gel-spun polyethylene threads and are sold under names like Fireline , Spiderwire , PowerPro , and Wildfire . They were originally developed as fishing line for sportsmen , but some clever beader somewhere discovered that these kinds of threads make a great beading thread , much to the chagrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantages of using bonded beading threads ? If you 've ever spent more than fifteen minutes trying to untangle a knot from your nylon beading thread , you 'll understand why I love bonded beading threads so much . Tangles and knots seem to undo themselves with minimal tinkering from me , and without conditioning . Although some bead artists advocate conditioning your bonded beading threads the same way you condition a nylon beading thread , I 've never had much trouble with an unconditioned bonded beading thread . <p> Its much more difficult to split your beading thread when using a bonded beading thread . It can happen , but you really have to work at it . Bonded beading threads create a slightly stiffer piece of bead work than nylon beading threads , so they can work well for sculptural bead weaving projects . <p> In addition to being sold at bead shops and through online beading supply companies , bonded beading threads can also be found in outdoor supply and sporting goods stores alongside fishing rods and fishing lures . <p> What are the disadvantages of bonded beading threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts , so for some folks , that 's a deal breaker . A good way to shop for your bonded beading threads is to look for weekly coupons and rebates offered in the outdoor supply stores where they are sold . <p> If you 're buying your bonded beading threads from an outdoor supply or sporting goods store , you can usually only find just a few colors " crystal/white , dark green , and black . When using the black or smoke colored bonded beading thread , its generally advisable to wipe each length of thread down with a damp cloth to prevent the color from coming off on your fingers as you stitch . <p> However , if you do n't  mind ordering your bonded beading threads online , you can find some gorgeous colors of Fireline available through Sparklespot Bead Shop in St. Petersburg , Florida . These colors are more stable than the smoke colored beading thread from the outdoor supply stores , and they work beautifully for bead-weaving projects where you might have a little bit of thread showing between your beads . <h> So Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about beading thread that I ca n't answer . Personally , I use both Nymo and Fireline for most of my bead weaving projects . I do n't  think I 'd be able to choose a favorite beading thread if I had to , because both of them have their advantages and are particularly useful for the way I do bead weaving and bead embroidery .

But potholder looms did n't  start out as toys . They were invented as a way for sock factories to use up waste cut from socks and hosiery during the manufacturing process . The looms were packaged with the waste fabric " loopers " and sold to Depression-era housewives who used the kits to make potholders and hot pads . <p> Over time , the potholder loom became more popular with children than their mothers , and by the 1950 's , it was seen mainly as a toy . But in recent years , talented adult weavers have reclaimed the humble potholder loom as a valuable weaving tool .

" Its called a spudger and is very simple to make . I use 30-gauge wire , usually copper , and loop about 8-10 loops around two or three fingers . Remove the wire from your fingers . Loop more wire around the top of the piece several times so that it will hold the 8-10 loops securely , then clip that wire .

Remember , solder likes to hide and works by capillary action , so it will run right up the spudger .

" You may need to hold the spudger with insulated tweezers or some inexpensive/expendable burn em up pliers because the spudger may get hot .

I bought every chemical , every cloth , every dip I saw that promised my jewelry would come out looking like new . <p> At some point , though , I realized that my taste was shifting more toward appreciating antiquities , and jewelry that looked as though it had just been unearthed . The aging process adds a natural patina that gives old pieces a warmth and a depth that just is n't there on new , shiny jewelry . Not everyone agrees , I know . Every time I show my latest creation to my sister , she says , " Mmmm , nice . I 'd like it better if it were shiny . " <p> But , I 'm not alone in my love of that aged look .

There is also an all-natural trick that will do the same thing , albeit a little more slowly . <p> Solutions such as Black Max will blacken a piece of silver instantly . Once its rinsed and dried , use a small piece of fine steel wool , or a 3M pad to polish away some of the oxidization on the high parts of the piece , leaving the recessed areas of the design dark . <p> Tumbling the piece in a rotary tumbler with steel shot will really bring back the shine on the high points , but still leave the black in the crevices . Its the contrast between the shiny and the dark that really gives a piece depth and character . <p> Liver of sulfur is the standard , most commonly used chemical for oxidizing silver .

Yes , its true . Cut a hard boiled egg in half , or in pieces , and throw it into a plastic bag with your piece of jewelry . After a day ( perhaps two ) , the sulfur in the egg will darken your silver . <p> By the way , all of these techniques will also work on copper , though the darkness of copper makes the contrast not quite as striking . <p> Check out the Spring 2009 issue of Step by Step Wire Jewelry or subscribe to Step by Step Wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance the wireworkConvertible Steampunk Necklace by Deborah Gray-Wurz and See Lantern Necklace by Gaea Cannaday .

( For our younger and future readers , they 're not hip homes for mice . ) When I first started metal stamping ( years ago as a crafter ) , I assumed it was wise to use something underneath to absorb the shockat least to absorb some of the noise of metal against metal . ( That was before it was music to my ears ; at that time , it was still just disturbing noise to my coworkers in adjacent cubes . ) So , I hammered and stamped with a mouse pad under my metal . <p> And it was just fine . <p> A few years later , I decided to stamp a special message on a jewelry gift for a beloved cousin , and I dug though my craft room looking for my mouse pad . I ordered my sterling-silver blanks from Beaducation ; I even traced my blank on a piece of paper a few times and used the metal stamps in ink like rubber stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the drawn blanks .

Huh . <p> Fortunately the dent was just a mere hint of a dent , so I figured I 'd just whack it again , harder , with purpose . That time , I got a bigger dent and ruined my blank . <p> I 'd at least been smart enough to order a backup silver stamping blank , and since it was almost time to give the gift , I had the second one engraved professionally and gave up on metal stamping for awhile , assuming the planets were in the third moon or some such that day and it just did n't  work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry-making world .

Make a grid to help you master stamp placement , especially if you 're going to be using metal letter ( alphabet ) stamps and stamping words or sentiments on metal blanks .

Avoid hitting the stamp more than once or you risk moving the stampand moving it even a smidge can create a blurred or double stamped image . <p> Experts have differing views on this point , however , as evidenced in Lisa Niven Kellys " Tap and Tilt " method . She taps a metal stamp directly with a hammer and then , without lifting it , she tilts it slightly to the side , hits again , tilts slightly down and hits again , and so on , until she has a good impression . here 's another time that practicing will helpafter awhile , you 'll know exactly how to tell if the impression is good or if it needs more taps . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Like I said above , use a hard metal surface under your blanks when stamping on metal .

A square kumihimo disk is used to make a flat braid , suitable for a flat bracelet . <p> If you find yourself completely smitten with kumihimo braiding techniques , you might want to look into purchasing a standing wooden kumihimo loom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these starting at around $40 , ranging up to several hundred dollars for a large , handmade marudai . <h> Kumihimo Bobbins <p> A kumhimo braid requires the management of multiple strands of fiber , cord , wire , or leather . To manage these multiple strands , and also to hold any beads in place while you braid , you 'll need a set of plastic bobbins . Again , these inexpensive plastic kumihimo supplies can be found in most local bead shops or from your favorite online bead supplier . A good rule of thumb is to make sure that you have one set of bobbins for each foam loom in your collection of beading supplies . I try to keep one set of bobbins for each foam kumihimo disc in my collection of beading supplies so that I can have more than one project going at once . <h> Cord for Kumihimo <p> There are lots of options for cord to use when making a kumihimo braid , with our without beads .

Leather can be used for making men 's kumihimo jewelry , or for more rustic and Bohemian-style jewelry . <p> And if you love making wire crochet jewelry , why not experiment with fine gauge wire and beads for kumihimo ?

@@14364005 @2964005/ <h> A Brief History of Chenille <p> Chenille is a soft , feathery yarn beloved by many weavers , and it gets its name from the French word for caterpillar ( presumably the fuzzy kind ) . The first chenille was developed in 18th-century France and was actually created by weaving leno and then cutting the fabric into thin strips . <p> Later , the production of a chenille fabric began in Paisley , Scotland . In this case , wool yarns would be woven into a blanket and then cut into strips . The strips would be heat-treated to make the fabric soft and fuzzy . This technique was used to create faux-Oriental rugs that could easily be mass produced . ( This chenille fabric , though , is different from the " tufted " chenille fabric popular in the 1920s and 1930s . ) <p> Today , the process of making chenille yarn requires no pre-weaving . Instead , short lengths of " pile " yarns are spun at a 90-degree angle between two core yarns . The pile yarns are what give chenille it 's feathery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rayon , silk , or other fibers . The core yarns , on the other hand , are typically low-melt nylon .

Let it sit until the knitting inside is completely damp ( this might take several hours ) . Steaming and spraying folks : Read on .

I patted the upper back into place and pinned the center neck , then working again from the ribbed waist , smoothed out towards the armholes and pinned those . Then I did the same with the lower half , always working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Measure and re-pin as necessary to shape your garment more accurately . This is where the fun starts , particularly for all of us OCD knitters . Measure , pin , repeat . Use the schematic or finished measurements as a guide . How much can I stretch my knitting to obey me ? Depends on the yarn , the gauge , and the garment . For most lace shawls , you can stretch it out to the fullest extent the stitches will reach . For all knitting , keep in mind that if you pull in one direction , your knitting will shorten in another direction to compensate . Try to keep the overall proportions correct and do n't forget to allow for things like negative ease , texture , and how the stitches look . <p> Do n't stretch out the ribbing ! <p> Special note about blocking ribbing : See the photo of the waist ribbing on my Bonsai ? Notice that it is NOT stretched out at all . I actually compressed it a bit , patting it evenly into place , and leaving most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck out of the lace skirt . ) This will allow the ribbing to maintain its elasticity and shape . <p> Step 8 : If you are a steamer or a sprayer , it 's your turn now ! Starting ( again ) at the center of the garment , carefully steam or spray the knitting , patting it with your hand to gauge the amount of moisture as you go . ( Use caution with the hot steam , and maybe wait a second after applying the steam to let things cool a bit . Do n't burn yourself ! Burns might get in the way of casting on your next project . ) Make sure to spray/steam your piece evenly so all parts of it absorb the same amount of water ( and in the case of steaming , heat ) . <p> Step 9 : Let dry thoroughly . Do not bother your knitting whilst it is drying . Leave it alone , close the door , keep your cats and overly-helpful roommates away . The impatient amongst you may use a fan to help the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember that a blow dryer adds heat to the equation and consider carefully if heat is appropriate to your particular blocking situation . <p> Each star marks a pin <p> Final and most important step : Un-pin , and admire the beautiful drape , the awesome workmanship , and lovely stitches that comprise your knitting . <p> As I was taking the photos for this post , I realized that some folks might want a clearer photo of exactly where I placed the pins . I quickly discovered that the little silvery pin dudes would n't show up in the photos , so I dug around in the supply closet ( I 'm blocking this in a spare office at work , because I have four very helpful Assistant Felines at home ) until I found some glittery foil stars . See the photo ? Voila ! Each star marks a pin location . Note that there are no stars at all in the ribbed waist section , but there are stars all over the lace skirt . Pinning out the lace patternI placed one pin near the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjoining . For lace patterns , I like to place pins in the center of an ssk or k2tog , as those are the strongest parts of the knitting and thus less likely to distort . You can put pins in the yarnovers themselves , but be carefulyou want the yarn to form a graceful " yarnover " and not an awkward " pointy-over ! " <p> Questions , Questionsand some Answers ! <p> Which wetting method did you use for the Bonsai ? My yarn is Berroco Bonsai , an absolutely lovely bamboo ribbon yarn , with drape and a teeny , tiny bit of " crunch " that adds texture and memory . I blocked my swatch using my garment steamer ( I LOVE my garment steamer ) , but I was n't thrilled with the results . The heat seemed to take away a bit of the sheen of this lovely yarn . So for the back of my tunic , I used the spray method , and sprayed liberally until the fabric was quite damp . I was really happy with how it came out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam-blocked ! It 's YOUR knitting , not mine . Experiment to find a way that works for you . <p> Do you block acrylic and other non-sheepy , non-planty fibers ? I 've heard blocking kills them ! What kills acrylic and some other human-made fibers is direct application of heat . So : Do n't iron them . ( If you must apply steam , keep the iron or steamer high enough above the fabric so you do n't melt or scorch the yarn . ) <p> But Sandi , tell us the ANSWER : Do you NEED to block acrylic ? Welllll . Here 's where I have to make an admission . I have not knit with acrylic yarn since I was a teenager , so I do n't actually have any personal experience with this . What I do know is that many experienced knitters say you do n't need to block acrylic . Given that , and given that I believe deep in my knitter 's heart that blocking has miraculous results , if I were to knit something out of acrylic ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would knit five swatchesyes , fiveand then try a different blocking method on each one : immersion , steam , spray , jelly-roll-of-wet-towels , and no blocking at all .

The swatch I liked best would be my guide for blocking the finished garment . <p> That saidthere are plenty of you out there in Knitting Daily Land who have tons of experience knitting with acrylic .

Do n't  use wire cutters , because theyll pinch the ends into points instead of cutting them evenly and straight ; then you 'll have to file more , wasting metal . <p> File and Pre-form : File the ends flawlessly even so they will match up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a tiny bit of the flat , interior side of the wire ( as shown by the red arrow in the photo at right ) to make room for soldering . <p> Use your fingers and flat-nose pliers to curve the wire into an oval ring . Do n't  bother with a mandrel and do n't  worry about the shape being perfectly round or even , but do be sure that the ends meet up perfectly ( in a butt joint ) . There should be absolutely no light passing between the two ends . Making the joint side a little flat will help the ends meet perfectly . Note : If you intend to keep your ring polished rather than add texture , use coated pliers or take care not to scratch or mar the wire . <p> Try on the ring to make sure it fits . If its too large , file and test again ; if its too small , start deciding who you 'll give it to ! <p> Pickle : Drop the ring(s) into hot pickle to clean it for a couple of minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure its clean , too ; then snip off a small ( about 1mm ) piece for each ring and use tweezers or a solder pick ( not fingers ) to place the solder on your firing brick . Lift out the ring(s) with copper tongs , rinse , and dry . Avoid touching with your fingers . <p> Flux : Holding the ring(s) in tweezers , paint them one at a time with flux and place each one on your firing brick so that each seam/joint is facing you and directly on a piece of solder wire . Note : If you 're making multiple rings all at once " yay you ! " but only heat/solder one at a time . <p> Soldering : Fire up your torch with a quiet ( non-hissing ) reducing flame . Keeping the flame moving and with the blue cone about 1/4 ? from the surface , heat the brick around the ring , from back ( away from the solder bit ) to the front ( near the solder ) , heating it gradually . Slowly move closer to the ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch for the flux to bubble and turn white ; that tells you you 're at about 400-F . Heat your ring more directly now , still moving the flame but staying on the piece , keeping the blue cone about 1/4 ? away from the surface . Pass near the solder more frequently now and watch closely ! <p> Look for the flux to turn clear and glassy . Then you know you 're at 1,100-F and your solder is melting . It will soon flow . When it does , you 'll see a bright silver line appear , and the solder will seem to slide up into the seam/joint , almost instantly . Remove the flame immediately . <p> Use tweezers to move the HOT ring to the cup of water ; tiptoe it in slowly to quench it before dropping it in the pickle pot . Repeat Steps 4 through 10 to solder your other rings . <p> After all your rings have been soldered , quenched , and bathed in the pickle for at least a few minutes , pull them out with copper tongs , rinse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . If your rings are secure , its time to round them . <p> Form : Drop one ring at a time onto a steel ring mandrel and hammer it repeatedly with the rawhide mallet . A little bit of magic happens here ; the ring spins a bit on the mandrel as you hammer it , and soon you will have hammered all the way around and it has become round . Be careful not to hammer downward ( from the smaller end toward larger end of the mandrel ) or you 'll stretch your ring . <p> Texture : I used a planishing hammer to add some texture to one of my rings and filed one in two directions with a checkering file to create a Florentine finish . I decided to leave the third ring smooth and shiny . Add whatever texture(s) you like or even mix textures on one ring .

School uniforms got their start in the early universities . During the Medieval period , universities in Europe were all run by the Catholic Church . All students were considered part of the church hierarchy , and so the students ' dress code was the same as the monks . <p> Over time , these robes transformed into different colors and included caps as well . Professors robes also became a bit flashier so one could distinguish not only their rank but their academic specialty .

Today , with few exceptions , most colleges do not require students to wear robes and caps to academic functions much less everyday classes . <p> Primary and high school uniforms are much more commonplace , and more likely than not the pleated plaid skirt of the Catholic school girl is the first one that comes to mind . This uniform has been around the United States since at least the 1940s as a way to identify students as belonging to a particular school . While these skirts appear to be mimicking the tartan kilts of Scotland , many ( but not all ) of the plaid designs are not official tartans .

The worsted yarn is called Twisted and the fingering ( in the middle ) is Socks the Rock , both in the Valkyrie colorway : lovely purples , browns , and grays . Its waiting to become a cardigan . <p> My original plan was to make a long vest out of this scrumptious pile of fiber ( photo at left ) , but when I got home and looked at the pattern I had in mind , I did n't  have enough yarn . Bummer ! And I only needed about 250 more yards . <p> Twisted comes in generous skeins of 560 yards , so I 'd have leftovers if I ordered another skein , plus the dye lot might not be consistent with my lot .

Underpricing your work can be just as bad as overpricing your work , so it 's important to be comfortable with the prices you set . <h> A Basic Formula For Pricing Your Finished Beadwork <p> Pricing your beaded jewelry is probably one of the hardest things you will encounter when you start turning your beading into a business . But if you want to make money selling your beaded jewelry , then you have to make sure that you price your work fairly to include at least two things : the cost of your materials and a fee for your time . <p> Most people will balk when I tell them that they should include a fee for the time they spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if you did it in your spare time or as your full-time occupation . You would n't go to work at a job for forty hours every week and then tell your boss not to pay you for the time you spent at the office , right ? It 's the same with the time that you spend creating beaded jewelry to sell for your business . <p> The basic formula for pricing your beadwork should be : <p> 1 . Your cost of materials + anywhere from 25% to 40% for profit <p> 2 . Fee for your time . This can range anywhere from $5 to $20 , depending on what you are comfortable with charging , but I encourage new artists to charge at least $8 to $10 an hour for their time . <p> You can also include any overhead charges that you might pay every year for your business , such as electricity for your studio ( if you have one ) or insurance . Those who make lampwork glass beads should also factor in the costs of propane and oxygen . <h> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've finished your piece of beaded jewelry for your business , done your math to calculate the price of the finished piece , and . . . you have sticker shock . You 've suddenly convinced yourself that no one will pay THAT much for a piece of handmade beaded jewelry . <p> But remember , you 're not trying to sell this piece as a bargain . You 're not appealing to the customer who wants to buy her jewelry for pennies at a big-box store or even a department store . You 're trying to sell your work to the customer who understands and appreciates handmade jewelry for what it is : a piece of wearable art . <p> No one says you have to charge the full amount that you calculate based on the formula I showed you . However , I always encourage bead artists to at least include a fee , however small , for their time . If you want to nurture yourself as an artist ( and as a businessperson ! ) , you should start thinking of your time and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished beadwork should reflect that ! <p> When you 're pricing your beadwork for sale , you also want to think carefully about underpricing your beadwork . Underpricing ( like asking $25 for a peyote-stitched needle case ) does n't help anyone . Underpricing your work can backfire on you , too to some buyers , a low price signifies inferior quality beads or poor workmanship . <p> The good news is that there are plenty of venues out there for selling your handmade beadwork at a fair price . It takes a little bit of research and a little bit of planning , but you CAN find people out there who will purchase and love your beadwork . <h> The Bottom Line <p> Being in the business of selling your finished beadwork means that if you want to have a successful business , you need to make a profit .

I know it will be expensive but the colors are gorgeous ! Sincerely , Laura W. <p> Hi Laura , Your math seems correct , based on the size of a 3/0 seed bead . However , I think it would be difficult to accurately determine how many beads you need per inch , because it will depend on your tension ( loose vs. tight tension ) , as well as the weight of your cord . The best approach is to create a sample to see how many of a particular bead size you use per inch . Then you can make a more accurate estimate of how many total beads you 'll need .

I am a visual learner , and I wanted to show viewers like myself just how a tool works and then where to lubricate the moving parts or how to use furniture polish to maintain a like-new finish . This segment has been incredibly popular . <p> Something I never imagined of when we shot the video was how it could help people choose between fixing up an old loom or throwing in the towel and looking for another loom .

Way back in 2009 , Knitting Daily founding editor Sandi Wiseheart did a couple of wonderful tutorials about picking up stitches , and I thought we could all use a refresher course : <p> What does " pick up and knit stitches " mean ? <p> Picking up stitches is a way to add new stitches to an already finished bit of knitting " along the sides for a button band , perhaps , or at the neckline for a collar . You can add stitches to any edge : a cast-on edge , a bound-off edge , or the side edges . <p> There are two steps involved : <p> 1. - Pick up loops along the edge of the knitted piece , using a spare knitting needle . ( This is the " pick up " part . ) <p> 2. - Knit new stitches into those newly picked-up loops . ( This is the " and knit " part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knit " " it is a two-step process . Many knitters do both steps for each single stitch " pick up the loop , then knit a new stitch into it " before moving on to pick-up-and-knit the next stitch . <p> However , there are many skilled knitters who pick up all the loops along the edge at once , placing them on a spare needle . They then switch the spare needle with the new loops to their left hand , and knit all the new stitches onto the loops in a second , separate step . <p> It does n't  matter which way you do this , as long as you do both steps " pick up , and knit " for each stitch . <p> I 'm one of those knitters who picks up all of the stitches at once , and then knits them as part of the next step " button band , collar , heel flap , whatever . <p> One question that I get all the time concerns picking up stitches evenly . I have a knitter friend who finds this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up stitches for her button band five times before she got the correct number . <p> Anyway , here 's how to pick up stitches evenly : <p> When a pattern instructs you to pick up a specific number of stitches along an edge , save yourself some frustration with a simple trick . <p> First , measure your piece , then gather locking stitch markers or safety pins . If you have only a small area , you may find that just dividing your piece into two sections will be enough . <p> For longer edges , use more markers and divide your piece into four or more equal sections , using a ruler and placing locking markers at even intervals along the piece . <p> Now divide the number of stitches that you need to pick up by the number of sections you 've created and you 'll have a much more manageable number to track . <p> I found this great tip in a back issue of Interweave Knits ; I hope it helps you out the next time you have to pick up stitches for a project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knits , there are tons of useful tips , such as the one above .

Note that this is pre-blocked , so when it 's blocked it 'll be impossible to find . Now , the puppy hair that 's knit into the sweater ? I think that 'll be visible forever ! <p> There 's no getting around it : there are some knitting bummers that we just ca n't avoid . Joining a new ball of yarn is one of them , but I think I 've finally figured it out . <p> I always try to join a new yarn at the edge of my piece of knitting , but there are some instances where that 's not possible , such as when knitting in the round . <p> I 'm currently working on the Lapis Yoke Pullover knit-along , which is knit in the round . On the body section , which is basically a tube , all of the yarn joins happen at about the same placeor within an inch or two of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yarn joins to look nice ( or be invisible if possible ! ) . <p> Throughout my knitting career I 've been joining new balls by knitting a stitch with both the new and old yarns and then dropping the old yarn , just like all of the knitting instructions say . But I always got what looked like a twisted stitch ! So frustrating . <p> So I switched to a method of simply starting the new ball on a new stitch without knitting the two yarns together . Technically it works , but it 's not elegant . There 's a hole that needs to be fixed when weaving in ends and the tension is so loose that I have to tie the end of the old ball and the tail of the new ball in a bow to secure them until I weave them in . <p> I was getting fed up with this technique so I decided to check my knitting Bible , Vicki Square 's Knitter 's Companion , to see what it recommended . <p> There are a lot of ideas for joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perfect the knitting with old and new yarns method . <p> I studied the entry and I realized that my mistake was that I was wrapping the yarn the wrong way and therefore making a twisted stitch . Here 's the correct way to execute this join and avoid the bummer in the process ! <p> Overlapping the Old and New Yarn <p> Use this joining method in an inconspicuous place , such as 1-2 inches from the side edge or in a textured area . This method is well suited for wools , synthetics , blends of any kind , and novelty yarns that are worsted-weight or finer . When worked with nonelastic yarns such as cotton and ribbon yarn , this join may be visible from the right side . <p> Step 1 . Overlap the end of the old ball and the beginning of the new ball for about 6 inches.Step 2 . Work two stitches with the two strands held together as if there were a single strand.Step 3 . Drop the strand from the old ball and continue working with the new.Step 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were single-strand stitches . During finishing , secure the two loose ends by weaving them diagonally into the wrong side of the knitted fabric ( weaving them horizontally or vertically may create a visible ridge on the right side ) . <p> From The Knitter 's Companion by Vicki Square <p> Now the trick here is how you position the new yarn with the old yarn . Take a look at the " Step 1 " illustration above . See how the tail of the new yarn ( shown in blue ) points to the right and the end of the old yarn points to the left ? that 's the key . I was holding the tail and end of the old and new yarn together and not overlapping them correctly , creating a twisted stitch with the new yarn . <p> No more bummer ! ! <p> You can turn your bummers around , too , with The Knitter 's Companion , now available in iPod app !

We were all so impressed that someone could be so thoughtful at such a young age , to make a choice like that . He was full of love in life and continued to love even after his death . <p> I 'd had ideas before , when I first started planning this project , but none of them would come back to me now .

The maroon and silver glitter represents Hunter 's school colors and his many , many classmates and bandmates who loved him . My aunt and uncle 's house was always full of them . <p> Hunter had a huge heart and we know at least one little boy will continue to live because of Hunter 's donation , so I placed the heart in the forefront , on top of the resin .

After Hunter 's memorial service , I was driving home late at night and saw two stars in the sky that seemed extraordinarily bright . Then it occurred to me that they were way too bright and too large for their spot in the sky . Thinking they must be helicopters or planes , I pulled over to get a better look . But they were n't moving and there was no sound .

@@14364027 @2964027/ <p> Soldering is one of the most basic techniques in metalworking , but also one of the hardest to master . For a very good reason , we are taught in early childhood to fear fire , and the possibility of melting a piece that has a lot of work ( and expensive materials ) in it is always present . However , as with any process that has a certain mystique about it , understanding how and why soldering works will make us much more comfortable with it . Especially knowing why the process works will let us do some intelligent troubleshooting , rather than simply guessing when a problem arises . <p> There are five basic areas that make up the soldering process : solder , flux , heat , fit , and cleanliness . If the optimum conditions are maintained in each of these five areas , the soldering process will go smoothly . It is when we begin to " fudge , " or get sloppy , that things go wrong . Knowing why something happens will let us solve the problem quickly . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wire and Sheet Solder . Photo from Rio Grande . <p> Soldering is the process of joining two or more pieces of metal by using a metal alloy whose melting temperature is lower than the metals being joined . Hard soldering is also called low-temperature brazing . Soft soldering uses very low melting temperature solder alloys , usually of tin and lead , and is not commonly used in fine jewelry . <p> Solder is a nonferrous ( without iron ) metal alloy , the major percentage of which is usually the same as the metal being joined : gold , silver , copper , or brass . Gold solder is available in different colors to match various alloys . Because brass and copper solder , both also known as brazing rod , has a high melting temperature and is brittle , silver solder is usually used on these metals as well as on silver . All of the nonferrous metals ( gold , silver , copper , brass , or bronze ) that have a relatively high melting temperature can be soldered with either gold or silver solder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting temperatures and are manufactured in several forms . <p> Paste Solder . Photo from Rio Grande . <p> Forms of solder include sheet , wire , pallions ( clippings or chips ) , and paste . Which form of solder to use is a matter of training and personal choice . I prefer to use sheet cut into small pallions , because wire solder , being round , will sometimes roll away from the force of the flame ; sheet stays where you put it ( usually ) . Paste solder , a mix of tiny bits of solder mixed with a paste flux , is used primarily by mass producers in machine soldering and is the most expensive form of solder . Knowing how much paste solder to use requires a bit of experimenting . <p> Melting temperatures of solder are determined by the zinc content : the higher the zinc content , the lower the melting temperature . Zinc is what turns the lower melting temperature silver solders a yellowish-gray ; to avoid conspicuous solder lines , use the highest temperature solder feasible . Pits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zinc burns out . Again , using a higher temperature solder ( and controlling the heat ) will help to prevent pitting . <p> The most common divisions of melting temperatures in silver solder are : <p> IT : the highest melting temperature , used on fine silver when enameling ; <p> Hard : used for bezels and as a first step when doing multiple soldering ; <p> Medium : used mostly when only one or two steps will be done ; <p> Easy : used as a final solder or when soldering on findings ; and <p> Extra Easy : used primarily for repairs ( distinctly yellow in color ) . <p> Gold solders come in hard , medium , easy , and extra easy as well as different karats and colors . One manufacturer has recently come out with a medium hard silver solder , with a melting temperature between that of hard and medium solder . <p> Photo by Robert and Wendi Beauford . <p> Because sheet and wire solder are indistinguishable from regular sheet and wire metal , these solders should be marked as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 1 , 2 , 3 , or H , M , E ( for hard , medium , easy ) ; wire solder can be hammered or even have knots tied in one end . In order to distinguish between the different melting temperatures , some schools like to use a different form for each : wire for hard , sheet for medium , and flattened wire for easy . <p> Why use different melting temperature solders ? When fabricating a complicated piece , using different melting temperature solders will help prevent the previously soldered joints from remelting and either shifting or coming unsoldered . <p> There is no industry standard for exact melting temperatures , and each solder manufacturer has its own specifications . Therefore , buying all your solder from one source will help keep the different melting temperature solders straight , although a combination of solders from different manufacturers may give you more versatility . <p> You will often see two temperatures listed : a melting point and a flowing temperature , which is higher . The melting temperature is when the solder starts to melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely molten . The difference between these two temperatures , or spread , can be from 25F to more than 100F . It 's important to know the spread , since it will affect where and for how long you apply the heat . Experimenting with solder from different sources will give you the opportunity to find just the right combination that suits you . Sara M. Sanford

Its more fashionable , more interesting , more creative . So I 'm extra happy to see Fort Collins , Colorado , artist Jennie Milners new series of jewelry-making video tutorials . Jennies videos are like two classes in one , covering both metalsmithing and using resin in your metal jewelry designs . I love that mixmetal and resin , hand-fabricated and handcrafted , colorless and colorful . Plus colored resin is a great way to add color to metal . <p> We often focus on metalsmithing basicshow to create texture , how to cut metal , how to dap and dome metal , and other techniques . But after you 've mastered the basics , you need the specifics . I gathered these six handy and tips about piercing metal , sawing intricate interior shapes , and sawing two identical pieces of metal at the same time , such as for earrings or other multiples , just from watching Jennie work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same design out of or in two pieces of metal for earrings and such , use rubber cement to glue them togetherand then saw both pieces at once . Jennie applies rubber cement to one side of both pieces of metal ( and her template , if using one ) and let it dry . Put them together when dry and apply your template on top . <p> 2 . When sawing an interior shape out of metal sheet , you have to drill a hole to thread your saw blade through before beginning . And before drilling into a piece of metal , its a good idea to create a starter divot , which will help keep the drill bit from sliding or bouncing off its mark . Normally you could hammer on a metal punch to create a divot just fine , but if you need to drill into these two pieces of sandwiched , glued-together metal , use a ball bur in a flex shaft instead to avoid the two pieces slipping out of alignment . <p> 3 . Saw out all of your interior or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . Doing this ensures that you 'll have more surface area of the metal glued together , keeping your pieces in contact while you do the more intricate interior cuts . <p> 4 . When all of your sawing is complete , simply peel off the template , push the two pieces of metal against each other to separate them , and rub off all of the rubber cement . If you 're making earrings with a directional design like Jennie does in one of her videos , just flip one of the pieces over after you separate them and both will be right-side-up . Then file and finish as usual . <p> 5 . Jennie shares that if your rubber cement has been in place awhile , it can get pretty solid , but there is a handy thing called a rubber cement eraser that will remove it easily . <p> 6 . If you intend to pierce metal with a lot of detail , Jennie recommends letting the rubber cement set about a week for a better bond before you begin drilling and sawing it . <p> Wouldnt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos are ready in the Jewelry Making Daily Shop .

It sounds as though you are experiencing some draw-in ( your weft is pulling the edges inward so the warp threads are being frayed by the reed ) . The rubbing of the reed on the threads also keeps the reed from moving quickly through them , which prevents a firm beat . The temple will keep the warp threads parallel to each other so that the reed does n't  rub on them .

The weft must be inserted at an angle ( or bubbled ) to allow enough length for it to take its over and under path as it interlaces with the warp threads . If too little slack is allowed , draw-in will occur even when a temple is used . If the temple becomes harder and harder to insert ( i.e. , pushing it flat feels as if it will tear the selvedge threads ) , insufficient weft slack has been allowed . The solution is to unweave or start over , not to make the temple shorter . My rule of thumb is to allow a weft angle of at least thirty degrees .

For a long time , I just chose colors on a whim . If they worked together , I always thought it was purely by chance . But after doing some intense color studies with bead artist and renowned color expert Margie Deeb , I began to realize that I was actually just trusting my inner color sense . <p> There are still times when I sit down with one of my beaded jewelry design ideas and have no idea what color seed beads to select before I get started .

In fact , using your color wheel can teach you a lot about how color theory works ! <h> Tints vs. shades . <p> To start , look at your color wheel . You 'll notice that each color has been sectioned off into other shades ( colors that have had black added to them ) and tints ( colors that have had white added to them . ) You 'll be using the corresponding numbers on each color to determine a harmonious match or contrast .

Look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored shape are pointing at to determine what colors to choose to accent your main color ! <p> As an example , with the color wheel pictured , if you wanted a basic palette of three colors , you would choose your colors using either the orange or red triangles in the center of the color wheel . A color palette of beads chosen using one of these triangles is also known as a triad . <p> You could also choose a palette of four colors using either the purple square or the green rectangle in the middle of this color wheel . A color palette of beads made with four colors from these points on the color wheel is called a tetrad . <p> You can also choose a palette of bead colors called a complimentary palette . Complimentary colors come from opposite sides of the color wheel .

Its very stretchy , so its useful for socks , mittens , gloves , and hats . Its also the perfect beginning for ribbing , which it mimics . The edge looks rolled over ; it appears to have no real beginning , so its very attractive on hats and cuffs of all sorts . <p> This cast-on is aptly named , because it forms a tube as its knitted . The knits stay in front and the purls go to the back . You achieve this by alternately knitting and slipping each stitch , creating two layers of fabric . Be aware that the edge may flare undesirably if its worked in bulky yarn , so you might need to go down a needle size when casting on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you how to knit the tubular cast-on . <p> I think this cast-on is pretty ingenious .

@@14364039 @2964039/ <p> Nothing sets your metalwork off like finely finished edges and a nicely polished surface . In the rush to finish a piece , sometimes this is a job that does n't  get the attention it deserves . There are a variety of methods that you can use for the process , but this is my tried and true method that I use for hand-finishing my jewelry . There are speedier methods , but I look at this time as " bonding " with my piece . It requires a minimum of metalsmithing tools and a bit of elbow grease . Let 's get started ! <h> Metalsmithing Tools : First , You File <p> Use the half-round file first . Place the piece to be filed on a rubber block or other stable surface . Hold the file in your dominant hand . The file works on the forward stroke . Lightly push the file forward to remove metal but ease up on the backstroke so the metal that is removed does not get ground back into the piece . Move the file in one smooth motion back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into smaller spaces if needed . <p> Follow up to refine the edges with a salon board , sanding pads and sandpaper . Choose the grit according to how rough the edges are after the initial filing with the metal file . All of these remaining files are multidirectional and put a nice finished edge on the piece . <p> Editors Note:When filing fine silver , Argentium silver , or sterling silver jewelry especially , try to keep a tray or fabric under your work to catch all those filed-off bits of silver . They might not look like more than dust , but all collected , they add up to money ! You can recycle the metal yourself or send it off to be recycled into cash . <h> Metalsmithing Tools : Second , You Polish <p> Hand finishing and polishing with a variety of abrasives after fabrication and soldering your piece is an alternative to traditional pickling and polishing methods . Here is what I use . <p> From left to right : 1000-grit wet/dry sandpaper , 3M metal finishing pad ( found in the paint section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foam pad with a micro-abrasive found at jewelry supply stores ) . <p> Start the polishing process with the wet/dry sandpaper . Sand the surface in all directions to remove all traces of firescale from the silver or other metals . Continue with the metal finishing pad . This pad gives a nice matte surface , so sometimes I just stop there . To really get some shine going , I give the piece a final buff with the Pro Polish pad . I love the smooth , just-enough-shine surface . <p> Here is the progression from raw material to firescale and final polish . Do n't  discount the beauty of firescale ! It adds an antiqued look to a finished piece of silver jewelry as well as other metals and can be used instead of liver of sulfur or other oxidizing methods . Just skip the sandpaper and use the metal and Pro Polish pads to soften the look of the firescale.

@@14364046 @2964046/ <h> The Origins of Filet Crochet <p> As with many of the crochet techniques , filet crochet was created to mimic lace . The lacemaking art of filet ( sometimes called lacis ) was worked by creating a mesh of squares before filling in some of the squares with weaving to create a design or picture . With the basic crochet chain and simple double crochet , the lace pictures of filet could be crocheted more quickly and easily , making this technique much more easily accessible . Interestingly , the filet technique is now often used to mimic filet crochet . <p> Doily made by Elsie Norman using a single chart for the cross-stitch and the filet crochet . <p> The term " filet crochet " appeared as early as 1912 , but the technique-then known as square crochet- appeared much earlier . In her PieceWork article , A History of Filet Crochet : Creating Pictorial Designs , Nancy Nehring talks about the first filet crochet patterns : <p> Instructions for filet crochet appeared within the first twenty years of written crochet instructions ( it was then known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as charts , tables , or written instruction . Needlework books in the 1850s were small , usually measuring about 4 + by 7 inches ( 11 by 18 cm ) , and this limited patterns to small projects such as little doilies and edgings . ( A History of Filet Crochet : Creating Pictorial Designs , PieceWork March/April 2013 ) <p> Briar Rose pattern by Mary Card from the October 1933 Needlecraft Magazine . <p> I love the adaptability of filet crochet . With a rudimentary understanding of the technique , you can create filet crochet designs from cross-stitch , neeldepoint , or filet charts . You can even easily create your own filet crochet charts with a pencil , graph paper , and a bit of creativity . <p> I love filet crochet charts for several reasons . They allow you to clearly see how the final design is constructed . A filet crochet chart will generally take up less space than the full written instructions and is easier for many crocheters to read . Plus a chart eliminates the possibility of typographical or pattern errors . 
@@14364048 @2964048/ <h> Metalsmithing Basics : Tips and Tools for Cutting and Sawing Metal Like a Pro <p> One of the metalsmithing skills I like to emphasize with my students is good cutting and filing techniques . Conquering both lends a professional look to your jewelry and great cutting/sawing skills make filing and finishing your metal much easier . And we all like easier , right ? In this installment , we are going to focus on cutting metal . Filing and finishing will follow soon . <h> Tools for Cutting Metal <p> Here are a few of my most-used cutting tools . Pictured is ( from left to right ) metal shears , a Xuron Maxi flush cutter , and a jeweler 's saw with blades . These tools leave the edges of the metal straight and smooth so a minimum amount of filing is needed . Over-filing can take away that flush edge and make it difficult to fit pieces together for soldering . <p> Let 's start with the flush cutter . To make a smooth cut on a piece of wire , there is no substitute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line up perfectly , give the wire a snip with the flush cutter . Before you make that cut , check to see that your cutter is suited to the wire gauge that you are cutting . These Xurons are heavy duty and cut up to 12-gauge soft wire . Make sure you are clipping the wire with the correct side of the cutter and that the heads are lined up at a right angle to the wire To get this straight , flush cut <p> Use this side <p> not this side . <p> Metal shears or French shears are my favorite way of cutting metal sheet that is thinner than 20 gauge . The heads of the shears are nice and smooth , so the resulting cut edge is smooth as well . These shears work best for straight lines or slight curves . <p> I use a jeweler 's ruler and scribe to mark metal for cutting . Then I just use the shears like a pair of scissors to cut the metal along the scribed line . After cutting , I straighten the metal by lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench block . Then the edge is ready to fit and solder . If it is the final piece , just a touch of a file will be needed to finish it . <p> Now meet the jewelers saw . My students shy away from this tool , but really , it can become your new best friend . I use the saw to cut shapes from metal sheet . Nothing works better on intricate shapes . Here are my tips for cutting metal with a jewelers saw : <p> Keep the saw stationary and turn the piece that is being sawed . You 'll have more control over where the saw cuts . <p> Saw blades break all the time . Do n't get discouraged if your blade snaps . Just stop , take a breath , and change the broken blade . It happens to everyone . <p> Reduce the instance of broken blades by using a blade lubricant . Turning a corner can also snap a blade , so saw in place as the blade turns . The motion will keep the blade from breaking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't push the blade into the metal . A light touch will keep the blades from binding up in the metal and the saw will move up and down with ease . <p> Make sure the blade is clamped tightly in the frame . A loose blade will not saw well . A tight blade should give a high " pling " like a harp string when you pluck it . <p> Brace the piece that you are sawing on a bench pin that clamps to your worktable so you have a stable surface to work on . <h> Choosing Jeweler 's Saw Blades <p> I default to size 2/0 saw blades for 22-gauge metal sheet and higher . For 24-gauge sheet and thinner , I jump down to 4/0 . The finer teeth of the 4/0 blade make cutting thin metal much easier . This way I do n't have a tangle of unknown blades to wade through . <p> To insert the saw blade into the frame : <p> Loosen the screws on the frame and insert the blade in the top clamp with teeth facing out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-up view of the saw blade with teeth pointing down and out . ) <p> Place the frame against a stable table edge and push so that the frame bows slightly . <p> While the frame is bowed , insert the opposite end of the saw blade into the bottom clamp and tighten . <p> Remove the pressure from the frame and pluck the back of the saw blade with your finger . If you hear a high-pitched " pling , " the saw is ready to go . <p> Hope these cutting tips are helpful . Feel free to share your own metal-cutting tips in the comments below .

@@14364050 @2964050/ <h> Get the Kinks Out : Reusing Yarn <p> Anyway . Four years ago , I knit a sweater ; a lovely lavender sweater knit out of Tahki Cotton Classic . I was thrilled with it when I first knit it , but I never wore it . I had changed the neck from a split-collar , polo-shirt type neck to a crew neck , and it just did n't work on the body . So I took it out and put on a different neck : I picked up stitches around the neck opening and used seed stitch to make a cowl neck . The hem and cuffs were seed stitch , so I thought that would look great . ( You can see this process in the photo at left . ) <p> Well , this was a very bad idea because the neck opening was n't large enough to support a cowl neck . It looked ridiculous , and I pretty much hated everything about the sweater at that point . So I pulled out my needles , folded the sweater up , slid it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . <p> I recently came across that sweater , and I realized I was never going to wear it and that there were at least twelve skeins of perfectly good Cotton Classic just sitting there in a bag . So I took it out of the bag , tuned in a good movie , and unraveled the entire thing . <p> In the process , I relived the knitting of that sweater and realized that I 'd learned three important lessons when I originally knit it : <p> 1 . If you 're going to change the neckline , plan for it early in the process . This was a raglan sweater and I needed a wide neckline for the cowl I wanted , so I would have needed to cast off all four piecestwo sleeves , a front , and a backsooner than the original pattern called for in order to leave a wider area at the neck . <p> 2 . Be mindful of yarn joins when you 're using a smooth yarn . Cotton Classic has impressive stitch definition ( but it also shows imperfections ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project is where I learned to start a new ball at the beginning of a row instead of in the middle . When you add a new ball at the end or beginning of a row you can hide the endsand that loose stitch that I always seem to getin the seam . <p> 3 . If you think a garment would hang better with some short rows added , you 're probably right . See that extra fabric at the bust area on the front of the sweater ? I added short rows to this pattern ; another first for me . I have a dim memory of the short rows being too high on the chest the first time I tried them and having to rip down another inch before doing them again . The addition of the short rows made the sweater hang evenly in front and in back without coming up in the front , which happens to a lot of us bigger-busted gals . <p> ( And one more to grow on : lavender is n't my color ! But it is my mom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer top for her . ) <p> How Can I Possibly Re-Use This Pile of String ? <p> So . After I unraveled the sweater , I ended up with a pile of what looked like purple Top Ramen . What to do ? <p> I decided to wind the yarn into skeins and go from there . When I had several skeins , I tried a couple of methods to see what would work best for relaxing this yarn . The first thing I tried was soaking a skein in a sink of lukewarm water , rolling it in a towel to get most of the water out , and letting it hang dry . <p> That process worked , but it was a bit labor intensive since I had so many short lengths of yarn that I needed to deal with ( I do n't know why I had so many bitsI do n't remember cutting the yarn that much ! ) . <p> Luckily for me , I just watched the very first episode ofKnitting Daily TV series 400 , in which host and Interweave Knits editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swatch of yarn into a pile of " yarn ramen , " wound it into a skein , and then steamed it . Eunny used a steam iron , but <p> HeyI have a steamer ! Operation " Relax the Ramen , Part II " involved that steamer and a hanger . Here 's the process : <p> Here 's the yarn on the swift . I put the pile on the floor and wound it slowly onto the swift . <p> Ready for steaming . I hung a hanger on the bottom of the skein to add some weight and to give me something to hold onto while I was steaming . <p> Steaming the yarn . <p> The final productgood as new ! <p> And now a challenge : If you 've knit something that you know you wo n't wear , do n't let all of that good yarn just sit there ! Grab the garment , get out your Knitting Daily TV series 400 DVDs , settle in , and start ripping ! <p> And while you 're amassing piles of yarn ramen , think back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it teach you ? 
@@14364051 @2964051/ <h> Different Types of Warping <p> I 've heard you say some things about this in past Ask Madelyns , but I 'm finding it hard to decide what warping method would work best for me . I have a new Schacht Baby Wolf loom , and I 've downloaded the warping articles fromWeaving Today . But I 'm unsure which one to try . <p> Martha <p> Hi Martha ! <p> Generally , there are three basic methods of warping:from the front , from the back , and sectional . The labels " from the front " and " from the back " are determined by the threading direction : From the front means that you 're sitting at the back of the loom and threading the warp through the heddles from the front of the loom to the back . From the back means you are sitting at the front of the loom and threading the warp through the heddles from the back of the loom to the front . The order in which you do each step and small aspects of the steps themselves are different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warp in the warping board with a one-and-one threading cross . Cut the loops at both ends of the warp and , with lease sticks in the cross , sley the reed . Thread the heddles , taking the threads in order from the reed . Tie the warp onto the back apron rod and wind it onto the warp beam . Tie onto the front apron rod and beam . <p> Steps for warping from the back : <p> Wind the warp on the warping board with a one-and-one threading cross . Do not cut the loops at the end closest to the threading cross . Remove the warp , chaining from the end that is opposite to the threading cross . Place a rod in the looped end and lease sticks in the cross and spread the warp in a raddle ( spacing the groups of threads in the density equal to ends per inch ; i.e. , 10 threads in a raddle with 1/2 inch spaces for a sett of 20 ends per inch ) . Secure the lease sticks in the threading cross and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind the warp on the warp beam . Thread the shafts , sley the reed , and tie the warp onto the front apron rod . <p> Steps for sectional warping : <p> Wind a spool for each warp thread that you will need in the width of each of your sections . For example , for a sectional beam that has 2 " sections and a sett of 24 ends per inch , wind 48 spools . Each spool needs the warp length that will be used in every section ( for 10 sections and a warp length of 10 yds , you 'll need 100 yds per spool ) . Placing the 48 spools on a spool rack and the 48 ends through a tension box on the back beam of the loom , wind 10 yds in each section of the sectional warp beam , cutting the ends ( securing their order with masking tape ) , and moving from section to section . Drape the ends from each section over the back beam , and thread the shafts , removing each end from the masking tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front apron rod . <p> Your choice will probably be between front to back and back to front since for sectional warping , you need a sectional beam and special equipment . Sectional warping works well for people who put on long warps that divide conveniently into sectional widths and use color repeats that work well in the sections . <p> To choose between front to back and back to front , the most important factor to consider is where it is most comfortable to sit while you thread the heddles . If you have a new Baby Wolf loom , Schacht has made removing the back beam possible , so that it is more comfortable to sit there and thread from the front . If you use complicated threading orders , threading from the front makes it possible to wind each color in a separate chain on the warping board ( instead of cutting and tying at each color change ) , sleying the reed with each color separately . A disadvantage to from the front is that you may occasionally have multiple ends in each dent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be twisted around each other when they reach the heddles as you beam . To avoid this , you would need to " transfer the cross " from one side of the reed to the other so you can place lease sticks in the one-and-one cross . This is a painful task . <p> It is often said that warping back to front is easier on the warp since it does n't have to go through the heddles . This is not true , since passing through the lease at the lease sticks during beaming is as hard on the threads as going through the heddles . To reduce wear on the warp , a fourth method should be used : Back to front with two crosses . Info for this is also available atWeaving Today . 
@@14364052 @2964052/ <h> Ask Madelyn : Causes of Uneven Warp Tension <p> I 'm new to weaving ; I just started a few weeks ago . Im having problem with warp tension . After I 've been weaving for a while , the warp threads are very tight on the edges , but loose in the center , even though they all were under the same tension when I tied on at the beginning . I 'm not sure why this is happening . <p> " Ana <p> Hi Ana ! <p> My guess is that the warp threads on the outer edges of the warp were wound on the beam differently from the warp threads in the center . This can happen for two reasons . One is that as you wound the warp on the back beam , the threads on the edges spread out from the width of the warp in the reed . That is likely to happen if you do n't  do anything to prevent it . As the warp goes from the reed or raddle , it tends to spread out on both sides since there is n't anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or raddle is from the warp beam , the more they will spread . The warp is therefore less dense on the edges than in the center . As a result , it winds on at a smaller circumference on the edges since there are fewer threads in each layer there , which means less bulk between layers . Then , when you start weaving , eventually those threads get tighter because they are actually shorter . You might have expected this problem if , when you finished winding on the warp , the threads were longer on the edges than in the middle . <p> To prevent this , I tie a strong cord firmly on the back beam on each side of the warp to constrain it at even a slightly narrower width than the width in the reed so that as the threads reach the beam they wind on at exactly that width . It is important to have heavy paper or sticks between the layers of the warp , too , to keep the edge threads from falling off the edges in subsequent layers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible cause for a difference in warp tension on the edge threads such as you describe . If you held the warp under tension as you wound on or had someone else hold it under tension , you ca n't help but apply more tension to the threads on the edges because of the angle they have to go through to get to your hands from the reed or raddle . For that reason , I do n't  apply tension when I wind the warp on , but instead wind a turn and then pull on groups of warp threads very firmly so that each group gets a lot of tension and the same tension ( the crank and yank method ) . There are other ways to achieve even warp tension , but this one has always worked best for me . ( I show all these steps in my video- Warping Your Loom . ) After you wind the warp on the warp beam , it should make a perfect cylinder with the same circumference from one side of the warp to the other . <p> It does sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I hope you 'll get some good use from these bind-off techniques , as well . <h> Bind-Off Knitting : A Fitting End <p> At some point , all knitting must come to an end and the stitches must be removed from the needles .

If worked too loosely , the edge will flair and look sloppy . Worked too tightly , the edge will fray and eventually break , especially along edges that are subject to stretching such as necklines .

Or maybe more than one question . I have always been interested in weaving , and have said so to everyone in my life , which is why a friend gave me this loom . But I am wondering about looms since this one does n't  look like the looms I see in photographs . What is the difference between this loom and others ? What can it or cant it weave ? <p> Lynda <p> Hi Lynda ! <p> I may have answered this question before or at least a question like it , but it comes up often enough that it might be good to re-address it . <p> The rigid-heddle loom is a frame loom in the center of which is positioned the rigid heddle . It is usually made of plastic and has narrow bars with holes in them alternating with narrow spaces , called slots . Warp threads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you lift the rigid-heddle , the hole threads ( every other warp thread ) are raised above the slot threads , if you lower the rigid-heddle , the hole threads are lowered below the slot threads . By raising and lowering the heddle , you can weave a plain-weave cloth . <p> The advantages to this type of loom are many . The loom is very portable . You can weave with it on a table or in your lap . The action of the heddle itself is very easy on warp threads . Extreme warp tension is not required , so fragile or softly spun yarns ( or knitting novelties or eyelash/ribbon yarns ) can be used . The spacing of the warp threads depends on the number of slots/holes per inch in the particular heddle , usually eight , ten or twelve per inch , so you can weave fabrics with those warp setts . To weave with finer setts , two rigid heddles can be used . <p> For weavers who love patterns in cloth , pick-up techniques can be used with rigid heddle looms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick behind the heddle , and the pick-up held in place for rows of weaving . <p> The other basic type of loom used by contemporary weavers is one with shafts . Every warp thread goes through the eye of a heddle ( a needle-like item ) that is placed on a frame ( the " shaft " ) . If there are two frames on the loom and the warp is threaded in the two shafts alternately , you can weave plain weave by first lowering ( or raising ) one of the shafts and then lowering ( or raising ) the other shaft . Looms with four shafts can weave patterned fabrics ( twills , laces , overshot , summer and winter , etc . ) . The more shafts a loom has the fancier the possible patterns and the greater the number of possible weave structures . <p> Shaft looms can either be table looms or floor looms . Table looms are portable but usually not as portable as rigid-heddle looms and need a table or stand ( you cant use them in your lap ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench that you sit on to weave ) . Most table looms cost more than rigid-heddle looms , and floor looms cost a LOT more . ( In the cost area , there is usually less loom wasteyarn used for warping that is left over after weavingon rigid-heddle looms than on table or floor looms . ) <p> Table looms allow many different combinations of raising and lowering shafts without being dependent on the number of treadles on the loom . If the shaft loom has treadles , it provides an additional advantage over a rigid-heddle or table loom . It allows what we call the " rhythm of weaving " that happens when you step on a treadle to open a shed ( rather than use your hands to raise the shafts or the rigid heddle ) , throw the shuttle across , catch the shuttle on the other side , move the beater to position the weft , step on a treadle to open a shed . Doing this , over and over , as you watch a cloth grow is an experience I think of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaving is also much faster when you do n't  have to use your hands to move the shafts ( or heddle ) . <p> Shaft table loom : portable , less expensive , good workshop loom , can do many weave structures and patterns depending on number of shafts , no limit to combinations of shafts forming the sheds . <p> Shaft floor loom : not portable , more expensive , needs space , can produce fancier patterns and more weave structures relatively speedily , allows a weaving rhythm , treadles require tying up ( to make the different combinations of shafts rise or sink ) , number of possible combinations limited to the number of treadles.

I ca n't go into an antiques store or junk shop without finding some fabulous metal whatnot that , more often than not , I want to make into ( hopefully ) even more fabulous jewelry , and my newfound respect for jewelry making with alternative metals fuels this passion . <p> My friend Katherine Wadsworth , a lampwork glass artist and metal jewelry designer , recently told me about jewelry she 'd seen made out of old cookie ( etc. ) tins , and I was immediately interested . I love gorgeous old . . . well , everything , really . . . but tins are among my faves and I wish I 'd thought of this first ! She graciously agreed to write about her experience with it for Jewelry Making Daily readers . Enjoy ! Tammy <p> Most of my own work is in lampwork glass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my exploration of handcrafted jewelry making with straightforward metal fabrication techniques . One of my friends refers to these as the " hack and cuss " techniques , and maybe that 's why I set it all aside for glass a dozen years ago or so . But a recent experience inspired me to dust off some of my basic metalsmithing skills and try to have some fun making jewelry from metal again . <p> My first encounter with this idea was on a trip to Austin , Texas . The Haven Gallery is a local Austin craft gallery that emphasizes art glass ( my first love ) , but the item I fell in love with that day was made of metalold enameled tins of all things ! <p> We happened to arrive on a day when artist Kari Stringer of Fat Cat Studio was visiting the gallery to show her latest work to the manager . A huge variety of earrings , necklaces , and bracelets were displayed across the counter , draped beautifully over the sides of the fantastic antique tins they were carried in . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawing through all the offerings . <p> Kari creates unique jewelry by repurposing beautiful antique enameled tins . People call them cookie tins , biscuit tins , or pie tins , but containers like these were once used to store all kinds of goodies , including cakes , pies , cookies , tea , coffee , candies , and even medicine . Kari seeks out a great variety of colors and images in antique tins of all kinds for her work ; then she cuts the metal into geometric shapes and joins the pieces to create fabulous jewelry . <p> Kate 's tins , before . . . <p> After taking some of Kari 's lovely things home , I decided I wanted to try my hand at making something simple and sweet out of these readily available and inexpensive raw materials . When I considered trying to make some cookie-tin jewelry for myself , I knew I could n't match Kari 's fabulous antique finds , which I 'm sure she acquires with a lot of effort and time spent scouring garage sales , thrift stores , and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around my house in a new light . I no longer saw them as just another useful little storage box for the many ( many ) miscellaneous findings and tools I have collected . Now I look at them and think , " How will I chop you up ? What will you be for my friends ? " Here are the steps I took to successfully deconstruct my tins and use the parts to reconstruct some fun earrings for my friends . <p> . . . Kate 's tins , after <p> 1 . Find decorative tins for your jewelry project . We had lots of Christmas cookie tins around the house , mostly ginger snaps , as well as some candy tins . You might not look at them with an eye for fashion at first , but once you get going with this idea , everything metal looks like it has possibilities ! You may even have a few antique tins cluttering the back of your closets , who knows ? But I would recommend that you do n't start dismantling really rare and lovely tins until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even fairly plain tins can be combined to good effect or accented with engraving tools . <p> 2 . Disassemble your decorative tins with basic metal-cutting tools . We call them tins , but most are actually made of very thin pressed steel , not tin . The metal has a lot of spring to it , but the thinness of it means it 's not too challenging to cut , so you wo n't need huge manly tools for this project . I used a pair of small snips that I usually use for cutting silver solder pallions . They have small jaws , long handles , and are very sharp , so they make quick work of snipping and work well around curves . Larger hardware-store tin snips will do the trick for the basic deconstruction but can be awkward for details . Also , some tin snips have a shallow serrated texture on the jaws to keep the metal from slipping , but these will leave a ridged texture behind that you may not want . Good sharp shears of any kind will work , but remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Basic disassembly of an enameled cookie tin means snipping down the side at the join , and then cutting around the bottom to remove the wall of the tin . That will give you easy access to lots of nice flat material to cut up for jewelry elements . The top of your tin is already nearly ready to go , but you probably want to remove the rim . The cutting process can be a bit difficult at this stage , because the tin has been pressed into a shape it will want to keep and it will resist you . Persevere ! And more importantly , protect your hands and eyes . <p> Your snipping will probably leave sharp edges and pokey burs , and it 's very easy to get focused on what you 're trying to snip and end up cutting yourself on a part you already snipped . Good gloves to protect your hands are a must . Pointy snippets can also fly up as you work , so protective eyewear is very important . Try to keep your snips straight and cut clean edges .

I was struck by her constant respect for the engineering aspects of jewelry design recently while reading her book , The Jewelry Architect , which is still one of my favorite jewelry-making books ever . <p> While most animals are content to leave nature as they find it , Kate writes in The Jewelry Architect , we want to " paint it , bejewel it , rearrange it , and sparkle it up .

" <p> Being able to incorporate those treasures and found objects into wearable art through jewelry making is a characteristic of Kate 's that I admire , because it 's a large part of what my jewelry making is all about . Having the ability to create just the right findings and components to incorporate anything nature shows me in my jewelry designs would be nirvana to me . <p> Kate is a master of incorporating mixed-media elements in her jewelry designs as well .

" When making a piece , my focus is on how to bring what I know about movement , connection , longevity , and presentation to its design , " she writes . " When I sketch , or when I daydream about making things , I am usually focused on things such as areas of joinery or small ideas for engineering that grow into bigger ideas for finished pieces . My finished jewelry is usually an illustration of some concept I had about movement , structure , or an improvement on a common theme . " <p> While Kate is most known for her work with metal and metal clay , she incorporates quite a bit of beading in her designs and has advice for remembering the principles of design in that kind of jewelry making as well . " In the spirit of making all of your connections as smooth , functional , and as strong as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickest gauge that will go through your elements while still remaining flexible , " Kate writes . " Think of the wire as your support cable ; you want it to be sturdy enough to hold the weight of your piece , but remain supple enough to allow for it to dance and move when you wear it . I choose the gauge of my wire and the weight and number of my crimps based on not only the size of the piece , but the length of wire between connections-longer spans are more vulnerable . " <p> " My first exploration into the world of jewelry design , and my first burst of engineering curiosity about jewelry , involved sewn beadwork . A friend gave me a cuff that she had made , hand-sewn with Czech glass beads and freshwater pearls , and I was hooked .

Hold the saw frame lightly , keeping your arm and body relaxed , and saw using long , even strokes . <p> Start sawing with the blade tilted at a slight angle ; then move to a vertical position and continue sawing . <p> From a reader , Diane Brooks , featured in Merle 's tips from Lapidary Journal Jewelry Artist magazine : Place a scrap of mat board used for framing pictures between the bench pin and the metal you 're sawing . It will help you in several ways . Starting the blade in the mat board prevents the metal from skittering around when the blade bites into the metal , and it cleans the blade as you saw .

One solution is to use your pliers to twist your saw blade 90 degrees so that the saw frame is perpendicular to the axis of the saw cut .

You 'll have more control over where the saw cuts . <p> Reduce the instance of broken blades by using a blade lubricant . Turning a corner can also snap a blade , so saw in place as the blade turns . The motion will keep the blade from breaking . " I default to size 2/0 saw blades for 22-gauge metal sheet and higher , " Kate says . " For 24-gauge sheet and thinner , I jump down to 4/0 .

Anita <p> Many weavers can clearly recall the moment that they knew how fabric was made ; for me it was in January 1976 . The fabric I was making was no great textile : a simple weft-faced sampler on a frame loom . <p> But now I understood . I knew what warp and weft were and how they had to intermingle to become cloth . My fellow students in the beginning class and I could walk next door to the room with floor looms and translate what those women were doing , how structures could vary , and how the making of cloth worked ( and they were nice enough to show us and tell us things ! ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about the Industrial Revolution , Ned Ludd , the Spinning Jenny , and Richard Arkwright .

After just a little fun destruction , you now have a decorative metal sheet that you can make into useful jewelry components . You can freehand cut some shapes with your snips or plan out your design more carefully . I decided I wanted layers of metal in one shape but in graduated sizes for my earrings to give them some depth and movement . <p> cutting around the traced design <p> I made templates using plastic sheet protectors to mark the shapes I wanted to cut . Clear plastic makes it easy to see exactly what part of the design will show in your cutout shape . I used a wet-erase marker to draw my lines ; these lines will rinse off the metal when you 're done . You can also use standard templates for basic shapes . <p> Start cutting ! Straight lines are most easily accomplished with your snips , and are also the easiest to finish afterwards . It 's always a bit of a challenge to cut a smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing to do to finish those shapes . <p> using a disc cutter to cut tin circle pieces <p> For circles , a fabulously useful item is a jeweler 's disc cutter or disc-cutting punch . It 's much easier to get perfect circles this way than to try to cut them by hand . They are generally made to cut soft metals up to 16 gauge , so they will work well on old tins . <p> Note : With all the snipping , filing , and sanding , it 's very easy to accidentally scratch or mar the design on your enameled tin with your tools , especially when you 're just starting out . If you want to protect the enameled images , you can cover the parts you want to use with clear tape before you begin your detailed cutouts . Scotch Magic Tape is great for this because it 's clear and easy to remove . <p> using a hole punch to create functional holes in tin pieces <p> 4 . Prepare the metal for jewelry construction .

Once you have your shapes cut out , you will need some basic tools to finish the edges of your metal cookie tin pieces . Finishing the edges makes them look better but also removes sharp edges or burs that pose a hazard . Small jeweler 's files and wet/dry sandpaper for metal will do the trick . Even an emery board will do in a pinch . <p> filing ( top ) and sanding ( below ) to finish tin edges <p> Finish your edges by first filing from each side .

A quick pass with a small round file works well . <p> 6 . Assemble your recycled metal pieces into jewelry . I used 18-gauge sterling silver jump rings to connect the parts in a pair of earrings I made with dangling graduated circle shapes , and I made my own ear wires using 20-gauge sterling silver wire .

I mean , we 've barely met . But hey . It 's what I do . And you manly folk deserve to have great-fitting sweaters , too , right ? Yup . So shake hands and let 's get down to business . <p> Recently , a young man approached me at a yarn shop and asked for help " upsizing " and fitting a pullover . He was a big dude ( and handsome , with a charming southern accent , and yes in fact , I am married so nevermind ) , and took great pride in knittingand wearinghis own handknit garments . But he had some " challenge areas " in terms of sweater fit : He had extra weight across his upper back ; he was large in the belly , but not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest measurement , it hung loose over his chest , stretched tightly across his back , and clung uncomfortably to his belly and hips . Sound familiar ? No mystery here . Men have bust measurements too , although knitting patterns refer to these as " chest " measurements . They have hips and waists . And sometimes , men need shaping to help their garments fit over generous bellies , buff chests , and other wild , untamed bits of manly landscape . <p> Measuring Men : Key Areas of Fit <p> The key difference between men 's fashions and women 's fashions is : Women 's fashions are designed for curves , and men 's are designed for straight lines . ( In General , folks . I just covered seven thousand years of fashion history in those thirteen words , so there 's gon na be some wiggle room , particularly around the Renaissance period . ) Either way , curved or straight , male or female , the lines of a given knitting pattern may not match YOUR lines , and that is where careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When knitting for men , there are seven key areas of fit to consider : <p> ( For grammatical sanity purposes I am speaking as though the knitter is a woman measuring a man ; those of you knitters who are men knitting for yourself please forgive the limitations of the language and translate appropriately .

Some folks like to do this one with his arm outstretched ; I prefer to do it with the arm down at his side , so that the muscular curve over the top of his shoulder gets accounted for . <p> Armhole to neck opening : This is the place where you find out how broad or narrow his shoulders are . Measure across the top of the shoulder , where the shoulder seam goes . <p> Neck opening : No dude likes to wear something that chokes himor makes him look like a chicken neck ! Measure a favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armhole depth : Give those biceps and triceps some room ! But not too much room , or it will just add bulk at his upper chest ( unless that is something he needs ) . Again , a favorite sweater or sweatshirt of his will give you some help here . <p> Hip circumference : Also known as " the widest part of the lower torso . " This includes his belly and backside . If the gent 's widest bit is n't technically at his hips , but a bit higher or lower , measure the widest part so you know how big to make the biggest part of his sweater . <p> Chest circumference : This is the base measurement for most sweater patterns . For guys , this is measured exactly like for the gals : Over the fullest part of his chest . If it is n't clear just where this is , then wrap the tape measure around his chest loosely , and slide it up and down his chest a bit until the numbers tell the tale . Oh , and tell Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in holding his breath ! He would n't want a sweater that tight anyways . <p> Total length : Too short , and a perfectly good sweater can make any guy look silly instead of svelte ; too long , and it can make him look sloppy instead of suave .

Knitters are clever , and we 've come up with lots of clever ways to make more and to make fewer . This abundance of cleverness means that we have an abundance of choices to make when we are putting a little shaping into our sweaters , and , as MT of the comments points out , for so many of us , our knowledge has been handed down from one knitter to anotherbut this does not necessarily mean that we know what our choices are and how to choose wisely . <p> Let 's focus on the increases and decreases used in shaping , such as the waist shaping we 've been talking about lately .

This does n't mean the increases or decreases have to be invisible , it just means they ought not to be little divas and shout " LOOK AT ME ! I 'm a DECREASE ! " One way to ensure that your shaping stitches support the rest of your sweater design is to work your increases/decreases so that they slant towards some sort of center line . This center line can be a side seam , for sweaters worked flat ; or if the sweater is done in the round , the centerline can be a pretend " side seam " set off by markers .

Always take fiber type into account when washing-what is good for some fibers is a disaster for others ! <p> Wool Wash <p> There are a number of great products designed to gently wash your handmade items . Soak and Eucalan are two of my favorites , but you can find similar solutions in the laundry aisle at the store . Fill a container with lukewarm water and a dime-sized drop of wool wash . Submerge the item and let it soak overnight . Check the stain in the morning-you may need to repeat the process , or apply some of the wool wash directly to the stain and let it soak for another night . In a pinch , baby shampoo makes a great substitute for wool wash ! Be sure to lay your project out flat to dry , especially if you are treating a stain . Putting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bleach <p> NOT chlorine bleach . That would be the opposite of good for your project . OxiClean is one example of this type of product . Generally , a solution or paste is made and applied directly to the stained area , then allow the item to soak overnight . The process may need to be repeated for stubborn stains . <p> The Cleaners <p> Sometimes , you just need a professional . No , not that kindalthough maybe , if you 're looking at chocolate rubbed into the carefully crocheted cables of some fine merino . I mean the kind that are trained and prepared to care for your fabrics . They have an arsenal of tools and techniques at hand to battle the really tough stains . I find it 's worth the small expense for the peace of mind . <p> And lastly , for Silly Putty , use rubbing alcohol and a toothbrush .

If you are making jewelry for others to wear , it is important to be familiar with common sizing terms and measurements . Even though the terms for sizing are consistent , bodies are less so . Be aware of this when you design for others and be sure to take appropriate measurements before beginning . <p> Sharp WordsThe focal bead in this choker is significantly heavier than the vulcanite heishi beads surrounding it , therefore it remains at center-bottom on the wearers neck even though the design is asymmetrical . <p> Necklaces <p> Unlike other types of jewelry , necklaces have an added design challenge : a necklace sometimes just does n't  look as good hanging on a neck as it does during the design process when its laying on a flat surface . Unfortunately , there is n't any magic formula to address this issue . Choker-length necklaces are a little less challenging because they 're designed to simply ring the neck , while a longer necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collarbones , breasts , and all sorts of anatomical challenges affecting the drape of the necklace . Here are a few strategies to help you with this designers quandary : <p> Do n't  ignore the laws of gravity . Think about where to put the hole in a pendant or focal bead . If you put the hole directly in the middle of a top-heavy element , it may flip over because of the weight at the top . <p> When designing necklaces , I often make the beads that are closer to the clasp with lightweight cores , but I make the focal bead-and sometimes the beads right next to it-out of solid polymer clay so that they are heavier and will therefore be more likely to stay at the bottom of the necklace . <p> Tell your clasp to stay put . Whenever possible , secure your focal element in place on the cable , chain , or cord it is hanging on so that it will stay put , and the clasp wont travel downward . If your focal element has wire , you can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chain . If you are n't  using wire , then use a drop of cyanoacrylate glue or a dab of two-part epoxy glue to keep the focal element in place forever . <p> Do n't  ignore anatomy . Think about how beads will lie against the wearers body . Many women have prominent collarbones . If your design includes branch-like elements you may want to limit them to the bottom of the necklace . <p> A choker of large beads will make the wearers neck appear larger , so many women prefer necklaces that have an interesting focal element , but are strung on a narrow cable , cord , or chain . Chunky-bead chokers are one of my favorite styles , but be mindful that they are not universally popular or practical . <p> Bracelets <p> A standard bracelet size is 7 ? ( 18 cm ) but different wrist sizes may require adding or subtracting length from this base size . A difference of an inch or two in a necklace can often be negligible , but in a bracelet even 1/4 ? ( 6 mm ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be annoying-uncomfortable if it fits too snugly and easily lost if it fits too loosely . Be careful to size bracelets according to the wearers wrist size , leaving enough length for the bracelet to move easily on the wrist but not enough to slip off the wearers hand . <p> A Walk Down Madison AvenueThe focal element of this bracelet is very light and therefore stays put on top of the wearers wrist . <p> The following strategies will help you design bracelets that work within the laws of physics as well as aesthetics : <p> Make the focal section lighter than the clasp . Because clasps are usually lightweight , it can be challenging to counterbalance them in the design process , particularly if you want to feature large beads in your bracelet . <p> One way to address this is to use lightweight beads in the part of the bracelet that you want to sit on top of the wrist . Fortunately , polymer clay beads with foil , cornstarch packing peanut , or cork clay cores are lightweight , as are free-form , open-wire designs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focal bead with a light core and make the beads closer to the clasp solid clay and/or larger and heavier wire beads . As an added bonus , using large lightweight beads also makes a bracelet more comfortable to wear . After all , who wants to be weighed down ? <p> Metal-plated plastic beads are lighter than solid metal beads . Consider using lighter plated beads at the focal area of the bracelet and heavier solid metal beads closer to the clasp . Natural materials such as bone , seedpods , and wood all make lightweight and interesting materials for bracelets . <p> Make it stretchy . Bracelets strung on elastic cord hug a wearers wrist and therefore stay in place . It still makes sense to be mindful of gravity and aim to make the focal area of the bracelet lighter , but you do have more flexibility when the bracelet is strung on elastic cord . Elastic cord also has another important asset-the wearer does n't  have to fumble with a clasp . <p> Hopes GardenA wide shank provides a solid foundation , both structurally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love big fat impractical rings . What makes a ring impractical ? If it is higher than about an inch , you 'll have trouble putting on and removing jackets and sweaters while wearing it . Ditto for bracelets with vertical embellishments . That said , sometimes you just want to have a little fun with jewelry and make a statement , and rings offer the perfect opportunity to do just that . <p> Physics of ring design : The part of the ring that wraps around your finger is called the shank . If the shank is narrower than the focal embellishment , you run the risk of having the focal element slip down rather than staying upright because it is heavier than the shank . If you want to design a ring with a substantial focal embellishment , use a wide shank . <p> Pins <p> Pins are a lot of fun to design , and because they are , generally speaking , on a flat plane , you have fewer laws of physics that you need to pay attention to . But like every other kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you get to have fun with the aesthetic decisions . <p> Consider physics . If you attach your pin back too low on the back of the pin , then the pin will be too top heavy and the top part of the pin will tip outward because gravity is pulling it down .

Here are some tips and tricks to consider when designing earrings : <p> Think in terms of mirror images rather than exact duplication . If an earring design has a curve or bend or is asymmetrical , consider how it hangs in the earlobe so you can determine whether the two earrings need to match exactly or whether a design element requires that one earring be a mirror image of the other . <p> Watch out for metal sensitivity .

Even after finishing my 200-hour yoga teacher training program back in March , the beads are following me into my yoga and meditation practice " last weekend , I taught a workshop on how to make your own mala beads using gemstones . <p> Meditation has always been a tiny bit of a challenge for me . Wait , did I say tiny ? Maybe more than tiny . When I was pregnant with my son , I took a childbirth class that focused on breathing and meditation techniques to deal with labor . I remember going home to practice , and getting frustrated because I found myself so relaxed as I practiced that I would fall asleep ! At the time , the instructor assured me that it was a good thing , and it was for childbirth , but when I sit and do regular meditation , I need something else to help me focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads as a tool for keeping my mind engaged while sitting in meditation . <p> I prefer to use knotting techniques when I make my gemstone mala beads , just the way I prefer to knot my strands of freshwater pearls so that one bead flows into the next . It makes for a particularly lovely , tactile experience when I 'm meditating with my gemstone mala beads , and when I 'm feeling inspired , I can wear them around my neck , just like a beaded necklace . <h> Materials for knitting mala beads : <p> S-Lon cord or silk thread ( size F silk thread is a good choice for pearls or small gemstone beads ) <p> Clasp or other finding for finishing your strand of beads <h> Tools <p> Scissors or thread cutter <p> Beading awl <p> Glue ( optional ) <h> How to Knot Gemstone Beads : <p> Select a thread . <p> Take into account the size of the gemstone beads that you 're using , the diameter of the bead hole , and the weight of the beads . Silk thread is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , garnet , or citrine . ( Thinking spring with those colors ! ) When I make my gemstone mala beads , or if you 're using a strand or two of larger , heavier beads ( around 8mm in size ) , I prefer to use S-Lon cord . It 's the same beading cord that I use for beaded kumihimo , and it knots beautifully between gemstones , too . Added bonus : it comes in dozens of colors , so chances are , I can find something to perfectly match whatever gemstones I choose . <p> Test knotting . <p> I like to make a few test knots with my gemstone beads and thread to make sure that the knots wo n't disappear into the bead holes . If you find that your gemstone beads swallow up those knots , you can either try double-knotting between beads , or use something like a flat washer or other spacer bead to make a smaller hole on either side of your beads . You do n't want to get a long strand of beads strung onto your cord and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> String your beads first . <p> To begin your knotted gemstone project , you 'll want to cut a length of cord and string your beads on the cord before you begin . A general rule of thumb is that a wingspan 's length of cord is good for a longer necklace made with larger beads . I use about 10 feet of cord for a 36 inch strand of knotted beads . To reiterate what my good friend Jill Wiseman teaches , cord is cheap " it 's easier to have leftover cord at the end of your project than it is to have to add a new cord 3/4 of the way through your stringing project ! Once you 've cut your cord , tie a knot about 8 inches from one end . String on all your beads in the order desired for your finished piece , and then tie another knot about 8 inches away from the opposite end of the cord . You can also use one of these professional finishing techniques for knotted strands of beads before you get started with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clasps and other jewelry findings onto your cord with the rest of the beads ! ) <p> Basic knotting technique . <p> Slide the first gemstone bead all the way down to the " empty " end of your cord . Make a loop by passing the end of the cord with the single bead under the rest of the cord with the remaining beads . Pick up that gemstone bead and drop it down right into the center of the loop , but do n't tighten it into a knot just yet ! Holding the loop in your non-dominant hand ( the hand that you do n't write with ) , pick up your beading awl with your dominant hand and slide it into the loop from the bottom . Gently tighten that loop around the awl , and use the awl to slide that knot down so that it 's snug up against your gemstone bead . Slide the next bead down , make the loop , and use the awl to slide the knot down against the bead , until you 've finished knotting your strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end , maybe using a little drop of glue to secure everything , and trim your threads . <p> What I 've found through making new strands of mala beads using things like rudraksha ( organic seeds ) beads and gemstone beads is that the process of knotting itself has a meditative quality for me . The rhythm of sliding and knotting the gemstones induces a relaxing , peaceful state of mind in me " very useful when I make a mistake and have to somehow undo a tiny knot in that silk cord . And I love the simplicity of using just a plain ol ' beading awl for my knotting . It 's light in my hand , it 's easy to use , and best of all , it 's inexpensive . And then there 's the gemstones themselves . My interest in the metaphysical and symbolic properties of gemstones has been renewed through my meditation practice with my mala beads , and I 'm always on the lookout for new gemstone beads now .

Laura is the designer and creative force behind Prism Yarns , a company that produces exquisite hand-dyed yarns created with an artist 's eye . <p> I knit a cowl out of Prism yarn , and it was so wonderful to knit with . The design was a smaller version of Laura 's Foxy Cowl , ( shown at right ) . The picture does n't do this piece justice ; that fur is not your run-of-the-mill faux fur . It 's truly luxurious . The colors are deep and sumptuous and the fur is so soft you can barely feel it . I want to make a pillow out of that stuff ! <p> A small part of the full spectrum of Prism 's Layers palette . <p> Laura 's story is an interesting one , and she told it in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chat about Laura 's background , her ideas , and her unique thirty-year perspective on the handknitting industry . Here 's a bit of that profile for you . <p> My Colorful World <p> I returned to knitting seriously as a hobby after graduating from art school and moving to Buffalo , New York , where I began working part-time at a yarn store as I continued to work in studio on my artwork . By the early eighties , my art was selling fairly well to the corporate market , but then a recession hit , and people stopped buying as much art . <p> I talked my way into a job as an area representative for what was then Tahki Yarns ( now Tahki-Stacy Charles Inc. ) and Berroco , covering upstate New York and visiting yarn stores to show product . It was a lean territory , but the job got me into the national yarn trade shows , where I realized there was a market for hand-dyed yarns . There were very few artisan dyers at that time , but seeing their yarns gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! I talked to Diane Friedman at Tahki and suggested a line of hand-dyed yarns using Tahki stock ; she agreed , and Prism was born . I went solo in 1986 , continuing to make artwork as I was building Prism slowly into the company it is today . <p> Prism really blossomed after my husband and business partner , Matt , and I moved to Florida in 1992 , where we bought a 3,200-square-foot building that gave us room to grow . Our signature yarn , Wild Stuff ( a yarn made of dozens of individually hand-dyed , gauge- and color-coordinated yarns hand-tied end to end ) , was born the same year we moved . I became very involved with The National Needlearts Association ( TNNA ) , serving as a board member and then as president from 2000 through 2001 . Prism was bursting at the seams by then . Although we , like many companies , saw a recent downturn with the overall economy , we 're now happily at home in an even larger building and doing steady , healthy business . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in 2008 . But making art and making yarn tend to feed one another , giving my mind visual puzzles to solve that eventually result in new directions for both . <p> The Artist : Inspiration from the Universe <p> I am forever grateful for the education I received as an artist at the University of Michigan . The rigorous program taught problem-solving as much as art-specific skills . A color course late in my schooling changed my life and has been the basis for all the color exploration I 've done for the last thirty-five years . <p> I think about color all the time , keeping a clip file of combinations I see in magazines and taking lots of my own photos . I look at a stack of fashion magazines and catalogs monthly to develop a context for Prism 's color , silhouette , and detail directions for upcoming seasons . My inspirations tend to come from the universe rather than from specific knitting sources . <p> Designing , like making art , is an organically serial process for me . A shape in ready-to-wear may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior in a knitted garment , or I 'll see a compelling color combination . Each piece is a result of everything that came before it , one building on another until I 've followed a specific theme through to its end . I think that being a good designer has a lot to do with being a good self-editor , which I learned through the critique process in art school . Just because you made something does n't make it automatically good ; a design can always be improved upon . <p> Given the wildness of some of my yarns , I take a surprisingly austere approach to designing . I try to avoid the " everything and the kitchen sink , too " trap . I want my designs to tell a strong , focused story , whether it 's about shape , color , stitch , or texture . Color is obviously a huge part of designing for me , but I 'm also very particular about fit . I used to sew a lot of garments , including making our wedding clothes , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fit , hand , structure , silhouette , and colorthey all need to work together . <p> Seaglass Shell by Daniella Nii , from Interweave Knits Summer 2012 <p> My favorite designs tend to be those where all those aspects interact in a compelling way . I tend to use pattern stitches to enhance color rather than as standalone elements , since my hand-dyed yarns have complex colors that already make a strong statement . I also enjoy frivolous , over-the-top ideas such as our Foxy Cowl , a simple tapered tube worked in exuberantly textured Wild Stuff and trimmed with Plume , an outrageous faux-fur yarn . <p> As told to Eunny Jang , Interweave Knits , Summer 2012 <p> Laura 's designs and yarns are incredible .

The one that really appealed to me was the Roam Cowl by Jennifer Dassau . Its really an infinity scarf that you can either wear hanging in a long loop or wrapped around your neck as a cowl ; its equally stunning worn either way . <p> The thing that sets Roam Cowl apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is achieved with a combination of the moebius knitting design , a merino-cashmere blend sock yarn knit on size US 6 needles , and an openwork stripe pattern .

Do not count the slip knot ( it is not on the needle ) or those on the cable . <h> Get Ready to Start Knitting <p> Hold needles crossed together as if about to start knitting , and tug at the cable rings to make them the same size . <p> Spread cast-on stitches until beginning and end are very close . <p> Check for one crossing of needle and cable by going for a " train ride " from the left needle around to the right needle , pressing cables into parallel tracks , pushing twist ahead to determine that there is only one crossing at the end . <p> Place a marker on right needle .

Repeat until all triangles have been knitted and the marker appears beneath the needles on the cable . You have completed the first of two rings . <p> The MCO looks like this : All stitches on the needle wrap in same direction . Stitches on cable alternate direction of wrap . Pivot point : Right hand pinches needle , slip knot , and cable . <p> Remember : Two rings of knitting = 1 Moebius round.The triangles are now gone , and the stitches on the left needle look more familiar ; in fact , they look like they were purled .

I also somehow managed to get a pretty verdigris using just water in my electroforming experiments ( as shown here ; more on that below ) . <p> I recently learned another great way to create a verdigris patina on copper and brass from Kerry Bogert ( author of Rustic Wrappings , a great book with a wealth of homemade patina recipes using ammonia , salt , vinegar , and more ) . One of Kerry 's great ideas for creating a pretty verdigris green on copper and brass ( her sample is shown on the left ) is with vinegar and sawdust , the fine shavings of which she says gives " an almost crystalline sheen to the surface of the metal that reminds me of The Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz . " Yes , please ! Here 's how : Put sawdust in a small resealable container , pour white vinegar on it , and mix until it 's paste-like . Submerge your metal in the wet sawdust , seal it , and set overnight ( or just a few hours in sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air dry and brush off any excess sawdust with a soft brush . That 's it ! Kerry recommends sealing the patinated metal with Permalac . <p> Flame Painting Rainbows <p> I 'm also a big fan of the beauty of raku-like rainbow colors that can appear on copper when you heat it just the right way , sometimes known as flame painting . This piece was flame painted by Mary Hettmansperger in her wire-weaving DVD . It 's random but fun and easy ! You can give areas of your copper passes with a torch flame and see what effect that gives you , or heat the entire piece , quench , and check out your results . You can keep doing this until you get an effect you like . Also , remember that you can make the copper turn and stay red if you quench it immediately after heating . If you wait a few seconds and then quench , it 'll turn dark or black .

The top piece has a variety of warm hues on the copper that almost look flame painted , and this electroformed shell and coral piece somehow developed that verdigris immediately after I rinsed it in plain water . <p> The Egg Patina Method <p> You probably always have an egg in the fridge , right ?

Eggs contain sulfur , so this technique is a play on using liver of sulfur . Speaking of which . . . <p> Liver of Sulfur <p> You probably already know about using liver of sulfur to darken your metal jewelry designs ( copper and silver , but not so much brass ) .

@@14364076 @2964076/ <p> If the word silversmithing intimidates you , get ready to get excited ! I recently had a discussion with Jewelry Making Daily 's Facebook friends about what we wish someone had told us when we first started making silver jewelry . What do I wish I had known years ago ? Silversmithing is not that hard . It 's not an extremely difficult process for only the most advanced jewelers , using scary jewelry-making tools . Thanks to a great teacher , I learned to do it quickly , and soon you 'll see that you can do it , too . <h> 5 Steps of Silversmithing Jewelry <p> There are basically only five steps from the design in your mind to the ring on your fingeror whatever piece of jewelry you want to make . Many silver jewelry-making projects wo n't even require all five steps . By breaking silversmithing down into manageable steps and learning them one by one , I realized that creating custom silver jewelry is an achievable ( and extremely fun ) process . <p> Sawing <p> A good silversmithing teacher will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good saw with the best blades you can afford and to master an effective sawing technique . Start with a 2/0 saw blade for best all-around use , and move on to a 4/0 once you get the hang of it . Later , a 6/0 saw blade is best for intricate silversmithing work . Lube your saw blade with Burlife , beeswax , or Gemlube and strive for a steady rhythm with a fluid sawing motion . <p> Filing <p> The better you get at sawing , the less filing you 'll have to do . The hardest part about filing for me was remembering which direction to move the file . Hint : It 's not like filing your nails ! Do n't go back and forthfile only in one direction : away from you . <p> Files are generally flat or half-round , and they are sized by number ; the higher the number of the file , the finer the cut it will make . Therefore , #0 and #1 files are large-tooth files that will rapidly remove the most metal in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very irregular or flawed edge , these are the files you 'll want to start with to fix it . If you can only buy one file , buy a #2 file ; it 's a good , almost-all-purpose , medium-tooth file . For finer work , move up to smaller-tooth #4 and #6 files . Clean metal bits from files after use with a file card . <p> A rawhide or plastic mallet can bend and form metal into just about any shape you like , around a ring , bracelet , or neck mandrelor any curved surface hard enough to receive the blows . Silversmithing hammers are available with just about any texture you can imagine , to create any effect you desire . Practice the hammering , texturing , and other metal-forming aspects of silversmithing on less expensive metals such as copper and then move onto silver when you 're familiar with what effect each hammer creates . Dapping blocks are like molds that help you turn flat pieces of metal into domed pieces of metalthat 's simple enough , right ? Right . Next ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more comfortable you 'll get with it . You 'll learn to tell the difference between an oxidizing ( hissing ) , reducing ( full yellow ) , and neutral ( yellow-tipped ) flame ; how to move the flame at just the right speed and just the right height as you pass over your silver jewelry piece to heat it ; how much flux to use to adequately protect your piece but not make a mess of your fire brick ; just the right spot to place your bits of solder and what it looks like when it melts and when it flows ; and how to determine the temperature of your metal by the appearance of the flux . <p> Tip : Turn on your Crock-Pot of pickle solution ( pH Down and water ) when you start a silversmithing project or a workday at your bench ; then the pickle will be hot and ready to clean your silver jewelry projects when you 're ready for it . Pickle cleans silver jewelry pieces before and after soldering . <p> Finishing ( Texturing , Burnishing , Buffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably have to file some more , sand a bit , and clean off any firescale that the pickle left behind .

Whether you add patina to your silver jewelry designs with liver of sulfur or through some other means , this optional step can create an antiqued look , enhance texture and details in your designs , and completely change the look of shiny white silver to dark . It can also highlight flaws , so you have to make sure that any finishing techniques are done before you apply patina . <p> Naturally , this is a simplified version of silversmithingbut it makes sense , right ?

And so it is with silver and copper . Copper and its alloys really warm up the whiteness of pure silver , and I love combining the two in my jewelry . As I 've said before , copper , I do believe , is my favorite metal . Nothing else hammers so beautifully , takes those gorgeous patinas , and accepts textures as well . Unfortunately , those who think " real jewelry " is only silver , platinum , or gold have not always given copper the respect it deserves ; yet if the prices for silver and gold stay up so high , copper and copper-alloy jewelry will be seen more and more , especially in fun art jewelry . That 's why were going to teach you how to solder copper to silver and more ! <p> If you have ever doubted the beauty of copper , take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most stunningly gorgeous metal art I have ever seen . If you think copper is a poor cousin to other metals , boy , you should see his work ! <p> Copper has had a rough reputation when it comes to soldering . Sure , plumbers have been soldering it for decades , but the esthetics of soldering copper plumbing and a seamless joint are not a consideration , whereas we usually want extremely clean solder joins in our jewelry . Many jewelry artists think this is close to impossible . Not so . <h> How to Solder Copper : Keep It Clean <p> The whole trick to being able to solder copper well is that with copper and its alloys , cleanliness is probably the most important rule . Copper , brass , and bronze have been repeatedly called " nasty metals , " and that name is well earned . They oxidize rapidly when the torch is just touched to the metal , and it happens very quickly . Its important that your metal is clean of any residue and fingerprints . Always scrub your metal clean with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandpaper , or 9-micron 3M finishing film . If your metal is textured , scrub with a brass brush , soap , and pumice , making sure you get in all those little crevices of texture . It is important that the water sheets off the copper . <h> Soldering Copper : Flux , Flux , Flux <p> Another huge tip is to use Prips flux , available from most jewelry-supply stores . This specially formulated pinkish liquid flux is a godsend when soldering copper . Purchase a small empty spray bottle , fill it with the flux , and keep it on your bench just for copper soldering . After you clean your metal , spray a thin coat on the metal and let it dry ; then spray on another thin coat and begin to heat your piece with the torch . If you are doing a bezel , be sure the bezel has been sprayed , also . Crank up the heat a bit and work fairly fast , because the longer you dawdle , the quicker the oxides will build up and the flux will burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solder on Copper ? <p> Ill answer one of the most asked questions readers write : Yes , I use silver solder and silver bezel on everything copper . Copper solder and copper bezel both oxidize rapidly and can create a real mess , so I use easy solder almost exclusively on all my copper work . Extra easy will work , too . ( The reason we do n't use extra easy on silver is because it leaves a yellowish line , which will show up a few weeks after soldering , unless you patina the piece . ) If your soldering is neat , you will never see that silver line of solder . If a silver bezel on a piece of copper bothers you , then throw a nail or a piece of binding wire into a small cup of pickle ; it will copperplate your bezel and also copperplate any offending solder . <h> Soldering a Copper Overlay <p> If you 're doing an overlay , it works well to sweat-solder the back of the top piece ( meaning to melt some solder on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dawn and a scrubber , and then lay it onto the backplate , but remember to spray some Prips flux between the layers . Then spray a coating of Prips flux over the entire piece . Crank up the torch and go in really fast . <p> When doing an overlay in copper and sterling silver , it may be easier to solder silver onto copper as you are practicing . Copper has a higher melting point ( 1,984F ) than silver has at 1,640F . If you are soldering copper onto sterling silver , you may overheat the sterling and the copper will sink into it . It can be done quite successfully , but watch for the softening of the silver ; if it starts to look molten , pull back with the torch and let it cool before going back in . <p> In all my years of teaching I have found many teachers who tell students to stay away from copper because it is so fussy . Nope , not me ; I say " Go for it ! " Practice , experiment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solder . Its not that expensive , and you can afford to play around with it . Silver was only $4 an ounce when I was starting out , so it took me some time to get around to experimenting with copper . But I 've learned what a giving ( and forgiving ) and gorgeous metal it is . <p> Now go get some copper , take a deep breath , and solder something . So what if it melts ( and it will take a lot of heat ! ) . Just breathe . Its only metal .

Here are some sizing notes Ive picked up along the way : <p> Most people wear about a 7+ " or 8 " bracelet , but that size can vary widely !

It 's a fun section , because each row is shorter than the last due to the raglan decreases . Whoo ! <p> I was getting really excited about that , until I realized I had a gadzillion ends to weave in . OK , I just counted , and so far , I have 31 ends to wrangle . Eek . Weaving in ends . Not so much fun . <p> I 've noticed a fair number of requests asking for helping with weaving in ends , particularly with yarns like this one , slick and shiny and just a bit slippery . So , let 's have a little adventure in end-wrangling , shall we ? <p> Let me preface this by saying : There are many ways to handle yarn ends . You , as Fearless Knitter , have to evaluate your particular knitting situation and choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A method that works with a fuzzy stockinette fabric may not work as well in a slick silky lace shawl . So it 's best to arm yourself with several methods , and , as the gentleman in Indiana Jones would say : " Choose wisely . " <p> In any yarn-tail weaving situation , you have several basic objectives . You want to weave in the ends so that : ( a ) they are hidden from the front side of the garment , ( b ) they do not distort the fabric in any noticeable way , ( c ) they do not make a stretchy fabric less stretchy , and ( d ) they stay woven in . <p> A Method For Weaving In Silky , Slick Ends in an Open Fabric <p> I knit my Drawstring Raglan ( Knits Summer 2008 , did I say that already ? ) in the yarn called for in the pattern : Berroco Seduce , a shiny , half-slippery , half-rough blend of linen , silk , rayon , and nylon . The yarn is slightly thick-and-thin ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held together with a shiny binding thread . <p> The lace skirt of the jacket is made up of 5 colors distributed amongst 13 stripes ; the stripes are too far apart ( methinks ) to carry the colors up along the edges as one might normally do in a striped fabric . Therefore , I 'm going to have to weave in a bunch of ends . <p> Considerations : I do n't want the woven-ends ends to show ; I certainly do not want them to come undone . The additional consideration here is that most of the ends will be woven into a lacy , rather stretchy fabric ; I do not want to destroy this property of the lace . <p> Here 's how I manage all those silky , multicolored ends : <p> 1 . I try really , really hard to change yarns at the end of a row . 2 . I tie both ends , old and new , together using a loose overhand knot , leaving about six to eight inches of both ends . ( This knot is just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be undone later. ) 3 . I knit until several inches past the yarn change , creating enough fabric to give the area around the yarn change a bit of stability.4 . When I am ready to weave in the ends , I untie the overhand knot , and thread one of the ends through the eye of a yarn needle . <p> 5 . Working on the wrong side of the fabric , I weave the needle through the first couple of " purl bumps , " up and down through each purl bump.6 . This is a lace pattern , so I do not want to run the yarn tail across any of the holes in the pattern . Instead , I make sure the thread follows the stitches already there , weaving in and out of various stitches as I go . Sometimes I go up , sometimes I go down ; but I never cross over a lace " hole " and I never cross over into another color.7 . Important : I do NOT pull the yarn tail tight as I am weaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am weaving into.8 . Every couple of stitches , I use the needle to " split " the yarn in the next stitch I am weaving into , so that the yarn does not just go " next to " other stitches , it literally goes through them . ( This will help keep the yarn from slipping out of place. ) 9 . After weaving in and out and through for a couple of inches , I carefully snip the yarn tail close to the wrong side of the fabric.10 . I repeat the above for the other ends in this areahowever , I try to weave in other directions , in other rows , so that not all the ends are packed into a single small area.11 . Final step : I give the fabric a gentle tug in all directions in the area where the yarn was woven in , to ensure that there is still plenty of elasticity and drape in that section <p> This all might seem like a lot of work , but I 've seen a lot of badly woven-in ends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an audiobook , turn on the TV , and take some time to weave in those ends properly , and you 'll save yourself from feeling like you have to make excuses later : " Oh , do n't look at that part , that part did n't work out so well .

@@14364085 @2964085/ <h> Lessons Learned in Torch Enameling Jewelry : You can do it ! <p> When I wrote about my newfound love of brass a couple of weeks ago , I was surprised at how many people commented , " I did n't know you could enamel on brass ! " Well , I did n't know you could n't enamel on brass , so I did and it worked just fine . For me , enameling on brass was no different than enameling on copper . ( I torch-fire my enamel jewelry , though . Maybe that makes a difference ? I do n't think it would , but not having tried enameling jewelry in a kiln , I ca n't say for sure . ) <p> I was also surprised and ever-so-happy to see how many of you were prompted to try torch enameling jewelry after that . I ca n't tell you how happy that makes me , because I love love LOVE torch enameling jewelry now and I want everyone to hop on that happy train with me . <p> If you have n't tried torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems the hardest part is getting comfortable with working so closely with a flame " intimately , even , since it 's right in front of your face ( and let 's be honest , faces are pretty dang important parts ) . It 's a pretty big flame , too , not a small flame like that of a micro torch , though if you solder , you 're already comfortable around the flame . I made friends with the flame pretty fast and learned a few other lessons along the way . I hope they 'll be helpful to you . <h> 8 Tips on Torch Enameling Jewelry <p> Speaking of the torch and flame <p> I 've used both MAPP gas and propane , in the short-and-wide wide " fat boy " canisters that are shaped so that they can stand up on their own . ( You 'll see that I keep mine on a big metal tray . Much like for soldering , you want to have a fireproof workspace for torch enameling jewelry . If molten glass or metal drops out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm enameling off my mandrel , it will land on this metal tray and not burn the house down . ) You could use brackets and such to attach canisters to your work table . I heard that propane is n't hot enough for enameling and can cause " muddy " or dull enamel colors , but I did n't experience that . I have n't been too picky thoughfor example , I have n't tried to enamel anything solid white or solid yellow , which are the colors I think would be most susceptible to getting " muddy . " Honestly , even during my earliest experiments with enamels , I did n't see anything I thought was muddy or ugly . It 's like when a little kid makes you art " it 's all gorgeous ! <p> Mandrels are important . <p> You 'll want them in a variety of sizes , because undoubtedly your beads will have a variety of holes . I ordered some small mandrels from Barbara Lewis 's Painting with Fire Studio , and I bought some larger-diameter rods at a hardware store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , because it does n't conduct heat and wo n't get hot in your hands . My steel rods are both threaded ( like a screw ) and unthreaded ; the threads are helpful in keeping things from sliding off , but of course they can also hold enamel in them and make it harder to remove the beads . Kind of like metalsmiths always on the lookout for more hammers , I 'm still trying to find more mandrels , ones that are shaped just right with tapered ends that are n't slick . I have an old awl that 's my favorite so farit 's roughed up and tapered on the end , which helps it fit snugly into the holes of whatever I 'm enameling . Somewhere I got a really long nail ( we 're talking about 8 inches longwhere on earth did it come from ? ) that also makes a good mandrel . <p> When you buy enamels , make color test chips on scraps of metal . <p> I glued my tiny test chips right onto the tops of the enamel jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under your lighting and working conditions . That 's the only way to know what color each one will truly be to your eyes , and even then there 's a little difference depending on the enamel layers , the metal you 're enameling on , and the position of the moon when you 're enameling . ( Of course that last one is n't true , or is it ? Sometimes that 's the only answer ! ) Use the kind of metal you 'll most often be enameling ( copper , silver , brass , iron , etc. ) for your test chips . If you put enough layers on an enameled piece , the kind and color of metal underneath ultimately wo n't make much difference ( silver vs. copper , etc. ) unless you 're using transparent enamels . Then the metal color does show through some , of courseit can also be a wonderful design element , as I mentioned before with the transparent red I enameled onto brass , creating a look of rose gold . <p> If you 're using transparent enamels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test chip on a scrap of whatever metal you 're enameling on when you begin a project . You do n't always know how the metal will change in the heat during the enameling process ( turn dark with firescale , form colorful flame patinas , etc . ) . It might turn icky , or it might be lovely . . . either way , it will be visible through your transparent glass . <p> Make every effort to find out what metal your beads or other components are made of when you intend to enamel on them . <p> Most of those purchased in bead and craft stores are something-plated pewter or aluminum , both of which will melt faster than snow in Louisiana when you put it in the flame . Then you 'll end up with a splat , like the one on the left , which used to be a pretty cool charm . Solid copper , brass , iron , and silver will hold up to the heat and enamel nicely . <p> Wear safety glasses . <p> For real , wear them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case , I wear them . When you 're working with an unknown metal , it can spark and pop and shoot out little flaming bits in every direction . You 're also working with molten glass . Right in front of your face . Wear the safety glasses . Do it . For real . Please ? <p> Gloves are n't a bad idea . <p> Speaking of safety , it 's good to remember that you 're working with powdered glass that , when torched , becomes real glass that , if it gets pulled during the torching process , can become long glass needles . In my early experimentations ( but not now , because I know better now ahem ) , if I got too much enamel inside a bead hole , trying to get that bead off the mandrel while it was still molten would pull a long glass needle , much like what lampworkers call stringers . You can burn , break , and/or sand them off ; either way , you 'll probably end up with tiny shards of glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry workstation , gloves are n't a bad idea . I do n't think I 'd recommend them during enameling , unless you get snug-fitting fireproof ones . <p> Keep a metal bowl of water nearby . <p> Use metal , or even glass , but not plastic . Do n't ask me how I know that . ( But I bet you can guess ! ) Note that you do not quench enameled pieces after enameling " definitely do n't , because that rapid cooling will shock them and make the just-turned-glass crack and probably fall off . But the water is important for other reasonsto quench heated metal if you see it 's going to melt before you enamel it , to quench your fire tools if you 're holding a metal component in the flame with them , to quench your fingers if you touch something that 's a little too hot . ( A fire extinguisher is wise to have on hand , too , but that goes without saying . ) <p> These are some of the trial-and-error lessons I 've learned while I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seriously , I ca n't say enough about how much I enjoy it , and I encourage everyone with even a little bit of interest to try it .

See #6 above . ) Torch-fired enameling is very hands-on , allowing you to feel like you 're not just making jewelry but you 're creating art . <p> You probably already have the torch , so you just need enamels and a few small tools , like mandrels .

And if after that , it is not what you think will work , go back to step 3 , and pick again . <p> After trying two or three yarns , you are going to have a lot of swatches , and know exactly what yarn you need to complete the project . ( You controlling types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this really does take less time then planning out a yarn . ) <p> And that 's it . That is really that is all there is to mastering your stash .

@@14364091 @2964091/ <h> The Hardest Part of Necklace Making <p> Last weekend , I started a new necklace making project using a huge crystal stone and an antique Chinese carving I bought from the FamilyonBikes Etsy shop . Designing the focal point of the necklace was structurally challenging , but I had a clear vision in my mind of how I wanted it to look . Making the necklace straps , however , was a whole other problem . <p> At first , I thought about making a single strap on either side using herringbone stitch . But I could n't figure out how to attach them securely . Then I thought about making one long herringbone rope , but again , the weight of the pendant pulled on it too much for me to feel comfortable wearing it . Finally , I went through my sketchbooks from last year and found a drawing I did of a three-strand beaded rope necklace that I wanted to create . The three herringbone ropes will be the perfect combination of structure and shape to both support and complement the focal point . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so easily or so quickly . It 's easy for me to come up with ideas for the focal points and pendants , but when it comes to adding the straps , I struggle . I feel like I 'm really just not that good at designing flat beadwork for necklace straps , but I do n't want to just use jewelry stringing every time I need a strap for a necklace making project . If you 're like me and you get stuck when it comes to making the necklace straps of your necklace designs , here are a few ideas to get you thinking a little more creatively : <p> Ribbon , satin , or leather cord . Sometimes , a simple necklace strap is all that you need to complement a stunning focal piece .

The colors of the satin cord complement or contrast with the colors of your beaded pendant or focal piece . <p> Chain . When I needed a way to quickly create bead embroidered pendants and necklaces for my summer farmer 's markets and craft shows , I found that adding a length of chain to a finished beaded pendant was a fast and professional-looking way to add a strap to any necklace making project .

Leave it plain , or add embellishments like crystals , pearls , or swags of seed beads . Use it plain or with a lovely beaded pendant hanging from the center ! <p> You can also use herringbone stitch or peyote stitch around the outside of your flexible plastic tubing to create a sturdy necklace strap that has a hefty form for supporting a larger pendant . <p> Of course , it always helps to keep a sketchbook handy full of ideas for finishing your necklace making projects .

@@14364094 @2964094/ <h> Top Tips for Beginning Wire Jewelry Making <p> When you start working with wire to make jewelry , I know it feels like there 's a lot to learn about it . For instance , there are several hardnesses , different gauges , numerous shapes , and various metals . Even after you grasp that the higher number gauges are thinner wire and lower number gauges are fatter wire , there 's still always the questions about which wire gauge works best for which elements . One of the questions about wire jewelry making I get the most is what gauge is best for ear wires . ( The answer is 20 gauge . ) Once you make wire jewelry for a couple years , it starts to become second nature , just as it is when you 're learning anything . <p> A- wire gauge is an essential tool for determining which wire is perfect for your project . <h> Wire Jewelry Making Primer <p> Here are some basics to know when working with wire . <p> The diameter of wire is known as the gauge . In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as American Wire Gauge . The diameter of wire in inches or millimeters is translated into a numeral from 0-34 . The higher the number , the thinner the wire . Most findings are made from gauges ranging from 14g-24g . Working with heavier gauge wire is more difficult by nature . <p> Additionally , jewelry suppliers will sell wire in three hardnesses : dead soft , half hard , and full hard . All wire will get harder and stiffer as you work with it ( that 's called work hardened ) . So if you 're going to be weaving or coiling wire , you should work with dead soft . But if you 're making head pins or ear wires , you want it to already be stiffer , so that it maintains its shape . In that case , its best to buy half hard . Remember , you can always harden wire more by tumbling or hammering with a nylon or rawhide mallet . Nylon and rawhide will harden without flattening . <h> Your Best Bets <p> Making simple findings is one of the easiest things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most useful . Imagine the money you can save if you never have to buy head pins , ear wires , jump rings , and hooks ! Some general rules for the wire gauge to use for each are : <h> Ear wires : <p> 18g-22g- ( Some people cant tolerate a wire as fat as 18g , and 22g must be very hard to hold its shape . I find 20g half hard to be perfect for ear wires ) <h> Head pins : <h> Jump rings : <p> 16g-22g- ( Again , your particular project will determine how thick a jump ring you need . The finer the gauge , the less secure theyll be ) <h> Hooks : <p> 14g-18g- ( Heavier gauge wire will make a chunkier , more substantial hook clasp . Hooks made with finer gauges should be tumbled or hammered to stiffen them ) <p> Some examples of the different sizes and shapes of head pins you can create with different wire gauges . <p> One great tip ? You can make perfect earwires by bending the wire around a Sharpie pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings , you can create beautiful jewelry with custom clasps and ear wires .

There seem to be infinite lace stitch patterns , and you can use them in so many ways , from an intricate lace stole to a bit of lace inserted in a hat or collar . <p> Knitting lace looks so complicated , but its really a series of increases and decreases worked strategically to create holes in knitting that form a pattern . Knitted lace patterns are almost always accompanied by charts , and its important to know how to use these charts to knit lace successfully <p> One of the questions I get a lot on Knitting Daily is " What does no stitch mean in a chart ?

This effectively removes two stitches from the row , leaving you two fewer stitches to work individually on Row 2 and , subsequently , Row 3 . <p> By placing a no-stitch box next to each decrease , the chart-maker is telling you , " This stitch will no longer exist and should not be worked on this row .

We love our accessories , and as knitters , we love to make them ourselves . If sweaters are the staples of a knitters wardrobe , knitted accessories are the embellishment . Knit accessories are the fun in your wardrobe-and in your knitting bag . <p> I like to have an accessory project on the needles all the time so I can take a break from sweater knitting , and accessories travel better than big sweater projects . <p> Whether its a knitted scarf , knitted mitts , or a hat knitting pattern , we love our accessory knitting ! The bonus is that since these projects are small , its fun to try a new technique , such as a lace scarf , a cabled hat , or some Fair Isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and in todays economy , we could all use a couple of one- or two-skein projects , right ? You can also " shop your stash " to find yarn for many of these patterns . <p> Below are some wonderful knitted accessory patterns and some knitting techniques that will help you make them ! <h> The Perfect Cabled Hat Knitting Pattern <p> Snowball Hat <p> The Snowball Hat is such a cute hat , and a wonderful first cable project . It can be knitted as a beanie or with a giant pom-pom " snowball " on top . <p> All you need to know is how to knit in the round and how to knit rop cables . If you need a refresher course , here 's a quick tutorial : <h> The Basic Cable <p> The most familiar type of cable is a simple rope cable . A rope cable is worked over a set number of stitches that are ( usually ) worked in a straight column , without- moving over background stitches to the right or left . <p> The cable strands are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purl on wrong side ) , which tends to come forward when viewing the right side of the work . The background is usually worked in reverse stockinette stitch ( purl on right side , knit on wrong side ) , which tends to recede when viewed from the right side . The flanking areas of reverse stockinette stitch make the central stockinette-stitch cable pop forward in high relief . <p> The actual cabling in a rope cable couldnt be simpler . At predetermined intervals , and usually while working a right-side row , half the strand stitches are placed out of sequence before knitting . Cable instructions and chart keys often direct you to do something like " place two stitches onto a cable needle , hold in front , knit two , knit two from the cable needle . " This means that you use a third , smaller cable needle to hold half the strands stitches out of the way , knit the former second half of the strand first , then knit the former first half of the strand . Doing so switches the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and creating a cable crossing . <p> If you hold the first half of the stitches to the front of the work while you knit the second half , you will have a left cross , where the first half of the cable passes over the second . <p> If you hold the first half of the stitches to the back of the work while knitting the second half , you will have a right cross , where the first half of the cable passes under the second . Rope cables typically repeat the same cross direction over and over for a continuous twist that resembles a rope . <p> Whether you 're a beginning lace knitter or an advanced lace knitter , here 's a fabulous technique that will get you back on track if you make a mistake , which is so easy to do in lace knitting ! <h> How to Use a Lifeline <p> Spectrum Scarf <p> A lifeline is a temporary thread inserted through a row of stitches that serves as a checkpoint if you need to rip out and redo several rows . here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifeline row . A good choice is an- unpatterned " rest row , " which is defined as a plain knit or purl row that usually occurs at the beginning or end of a pattern repeat . <p> 2 ) After completing the designated row , thread a fine , smooth thread ( crochet thread or embroidery floss works well ) in a contrasting color onto a tapestry needle and run it through the bottom of each stitch on the needle , but not through any markers . Pull the lifeline thread out on each side of the row , leaving tails at least 6 ? hanging down on each side . When you resume knitting , be careful not to knit the lifeline into the new stitches you make . <p> With luck , you 'll never need to use the lifeline . But if you discover a mistake , remove the knitting needle and ravel down to the lifeline thread . With a smaller size knitting needle , pick up stitches along the lifeline thread by inserting the needle tip through each stitch held by the lifeline ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the original marked row so that they are mounted on the needle properly . Do not remove the lifeline . Count the stitches to be sure that you have the number you should have on the designated lifeline row . Then resume knitting with the original size needles . <p> When beginning a lace pattern , some knitters place lifelines between each lace repeat until they 've become comfortable with the pattern . <h> Preventing Mistakes <p> Practicing a few good habits will make it easy to work even the trickiest lace pattern . <p> Be sure that you can easily read and keep your place in the instructions . Enlarge charts and , if necessary , transcribe texts or charts into terminology or symbols that work for you . <p> Use a magnetic strip , ruler , or Post-it just above the row you are working . Doing so helps your eyes focus on that row while it allows you to check previously knitted rows as a reference point . <p> Create good working conditions : increase lighting , minimize distractions , and avoid knitting when you are tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use markers liberally , place lifelines , and visually compare your knitting against any available charts and sample photographs . <p> Read the pattern out loud as you work through the lace repeat the first few times .

When I started I did n't know anything about beading . Now I teach over 100 different classes at the shop as well as major shows , bead societies , and local groups . I love teaching and inspiring beaders . <p> Has your work won awards ?

I should have a bumper sticker that says , " A Day Without Soldering Is a Day Without Sunshine . " Most of the letters I get from you have soldering questions . But I also get tons of requests about how to make pieces have that antique or gently loved look , that look that makes them feel like they were dug up yesterday from some ancient civilization . Guess what ? I have a new metalsmithing DVD coming out on how to do just that very thing , titled Metalsmith Essentials : Hand Finishing Jewelry with Lexi Erickson . <p> The trick to almost all of my metalsmithing designs is in the hand finishing , and its much different than putting them in a tumbler or finishing them on the rapidly spinning wheels of tripoli and rouge . The trick is what I call " The Zen of the Process " . . . the metalsmithing process , of course . <p> Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lexi Erickson . Right : Gormans Gate , made in honor of the Taos artist R.C. Gorman and featured as a step-by-step project in Lapidary Journal Jewelry Artist . <p> Once upon a time I was the Queen of High Polish . My university professor taught that the high polish was the hardest finish to achieve , so there I was , every day in class , goggles on , hair tied back in a pony tail , red rouge residue blackening my face , polishing and buffing away in front of those whirring six-inch wheels , making my pieces gleam with the high polish . Front , back , sides . . . nothing escaped my eagle-eye gaze , and I freaked out if there was a scratch or fingerprint on my mirror-finished piece . The pieces were sleek , contemporary , and you could see yourself in them . Laid out at the end of the semester , my work had that " Do n't  dare touch me " look . It was cold and as perfect as I could get it . I got the " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a single piece . <p> Fast-forward a few years . My husband was transferred to South America because of his job . I had no visa for working , and my usually active lifestyle came to a screeching halt . My new friends were ladies who lunched and played bridge all day . I 'd rather be shot out of a cannon than play bridge , so I started teaching the- women of Chile to make jewelry . The only thing was , many of them did n't  have electricity or many metalwork tools . The typical metalsmithing studio had a rolling mill and a propane torch , a saw and a dozen saw blades , one file , a few hammers , two pairs of pliers , a piece of sandpaper , and the ever-present kitty rubbing against my legs . Teaching these women was a tremendous challenge for me , but as it turned out , they taught me so much . It changed my jewelry and me , forever . <p> The first thing I noticed about their jewelry versus mine was theirs had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the look , and how they achieved it was by not overworking a piece . There was no frantic buffing-wheel finish , but a gentleness to their handling and sanding of a piece . The jewelry now felt really good in my hands , and the ever-present angst over a scratch was not therein fact some scratches were okay , because they gave the piece character . <p> So I will share with you how to give your metal jewelry soul , that enduring feeling of gentle aging and timelessness . You do n't  have to run get the polishing cloth each time you want to wear your jewelry . And it all starts with hand finishing your metalwork . <p> Metalsmithing Techniques : the Zen of Hand FinishingAs I say in my Hand Finishing Jewelry video , when you come to my studio , its calm and relaxing ; maybe soft Native American flute music is playing ; there is the smell of pi+on incense from Santa Fe ; and there 's the ever-present kitty . Youre transported to another time and place . No loud machines or loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of Fretz texture hammers , files , and finishing films . I love the 3M Imperial Micro-finishing Films . They are backed with plastic , and one sheet will last a looooong time . They are also micron graded ; that gives you a consistent finish without some errant large " boulder " that can creep into your regular run-of-the-mill hardware store sandpaper and make a scratch that ruins your smooth finish . After soldering and final clean up , I like to go to the 30-micron ( equal to 400-grit ) finishing film . Cut yourself about a 2-inch square of the film and sand your entire piece , front , back and sides . The trick ? Go in one direction only ; do n't  sand in circles . <p> After the surface looks even , move up to the 15-micron ( 600-grit ) film and do the same thing . You will notice a smoothness and consistency of finish that is not always possible with other sandpapers . In addition , this should be a thoughtful process on your part ; enjoy watching the finish happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , and enjoy the feeling that you may stop this process any time . You are n't  rapidly removing metal ( or texture ) that can happen quickly if you are using a 60-mile-an-hour spinning tripoli wheel . You have complete control over the metal , and you see what is happening . You are learning the Zen of the Process . You have a consistency of texture . <p> For all the tools I have , these plus a rawhide mallet and my Knewconcepts saw are the ones I use the most . This is the 3M Micro-finishing Film , the Fretz sharp hammer , a burnisher , and my tiny 3-inch #6 Grobet file . All you need for properly hand-finishing metal jewelry . <p> When your sandpaper marks are satisfactory , you may move on up to the 9-micron ( 1200-grit ) film , or you may stop where you are . When I get the finish I like , I rapidly burnish the edges and top , too , if there is some texture that I wish to highlight . What you must remember is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With hand finishing , you decide exactly what finish you like on your metal , when to stop , and what to highlight . Hand finishing , to me , means the ultimate in fine craftsmanship . The " scratches " or textures that give the piece soul are not the result of bad craftsmanship but of a highly thought out , controlled metalsmithing process . The highly burnished edges and attention to detail all come into sharp focus when you enjoy the Zen of the ( hand-finishing ) Process . <p> I demo how to do this and share many other details of hand finishing in my DVD , Metalsmith Essentials : Hand Finishing Jewelry . ( You can also get it in a special metal finishing collectionsee below for details . ) I know the things I learned from the women of South America changed my metalsmithing for the better .

@@14364101 @2964101/ <h> Choosing the Right Yarn : Felting <p> Sometimes all it takes to get us knitters to plunk down a chunk o ' change for a ball of yarn is a blend of pretty colors and a yarn that feels good against our cheek . Sometimes , however , you need a yarn with certain qualities : you 're sensitive to wool , you want to make a felted project , you want something washable . How do you know if the yarn you are holding in your hand is the RIGHT yarn for your felting yarn project ? <p> Ah , now . This is something I learned about from my spinning classes , folks . So all you out there who were wondering why the heck I was going on and on about spinning last week . There is a method to my madness . Over the next few months , I 'll have some posts about choosing yarn , the RIGHT yarn , for your knitting " and I will share some of the knowledge about felting yarn I learned whilst learning to spin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn for a felting yarn project " one you knit first , then toss into the washer with the intention of shrinking it and matting it up into a solid-ish , fuzzy-ish fabric . <h> On Choosing and Felting Yarn : <h> How do you know which yarn will felt ? <p> If you are making a felted project , the first thing you need to ask is : did the fiber come from an animal ? If it did , then it might felt . ( Notice : I said " might . " ) Next , look at the label and ask : Is it ALL from an animal ? Any non-animal fibers in your yarn will either cause it to not felt at all , or cause the felting to be a bit less consistent and " felt-y " than you probably want it to be . <h> Why does yarn-from-an-animal felt ? <p> Sheep and other animal fibers are scaly " picture a fish 's scales covering each fiber . When you dunk wool into hot water and swish it around , these scales open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along the length of the fiber . When they open up , the scales catch onto nearby scales and grab on . The more fibers you have , and the more you rub the fibers around , the more scales there are to catch onto each other . The fibers get all tangled up , and more scales grab tight , until you have felt . <h> Do all animal fibers felt ? <p> I would have to say " to varying degrees " and " eventually . " A disclaimer is in order : I am by no means a felting expert , and I have n't read every single book on the subject . So if you know more than I do , please chime in here ! <p> Some wools have smaller scales , some have larger scales . Some have " smoother " scales , some coarser . All of those little details will affect the degree to which the wool felts . Also : The way in which a particular fiber is processed and dyed affects felting . Did you know that a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same type and brand ? This is because the dyes can smooth down , or raise up , the little scales on the colored yarns . White yarns may be bleached , which affects the yarn differently . Naturally colored yarns may not be dyed or bleached at all . <p> Some yarns are specially treated with a substance that smooths down the scales . These yarns are called " superwash " or " machine washable " wools , meaning you can wash them in a washing machine and they wo n't felt . However , over time , with wear and a lot of machine agitation , the special fiber treatment may rub off , and your socks may start felting . <p> So : No scales , no felt . Sheep 's wool is not the only fiber with scales , so it is not the only animal fiber that felts . Alpaca will felt . Llama will felt . Each animal 's fiber is slightly different , however , so ( you 're going to hate me for thishere it comes ) swatch carefully , including felting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use is the RIGHT yarn . <h> Really ? ALL animal fibers ? <p> The ONE exception to the Animal Fibers Are Candidates For Felting Yarn rule is silk . Silk comes from silkworms , and I would argue that worms are not animals , they are worms , thus : bugs . Silk is not worm hair . Silk is extruded from the worm ; silk starts out as a liquid . ( Ahem . Use your brains , here , folks : " extruded " plus " liquid " equalsoh yes . That 's what silk is . Hardened Bug Extrusion . Very pretty and wonderful hardened bug extrusion , it is , too . ) <p> Bug extrusion hath no scales , therefore , silk wo n't felt . <p> Have you learned something about felting yarns that felt and wont felt ?

Admittedly , I do n't  do it nearly often enough . Its an incredibly versatile bead-weaving technique that can be used to create incredibly strong beaded structures for beaded necklaces and bracelets . <p> Cubic right-angle weave differs from tubular right-angle weave in that it is a solid piece of beadwork with little " walls " between each unit . Tubular right-angle weave is just that : A hollow piece of right-angle weave that you can wrap around a cord or other armature to give it structure . Cubic right-angle weave does n't  need an armature to give it a sound structure . <p> In writing up and photographing this little tutorial , I realized that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else !

@@14364104 @2964104/ <h> The Basics of Blocking , Part One <p> Since I finished the back of the Bonsai Tunic last weekend ( from Interweave Knits Spring 2007 ) , I figured the best way to start talking about blocking was to do a bit of show-and-tell , starring my new best friend : the charming Miss Blocking Board ! The board was a birthday treat for myself , and now that I 've had a chance to drive Miss Board around the block a bit , I 'm wondering what I ever did without her . <p> Note : The instructions given here will work for a variety of knitted and crocheted items . Lace shawls and certain other pieces require a bit of special red-carpet treatment , which we can talk about later . <p> Step 1 : Gather the basic tools . You 'll need the following : <p> A surface to block on . Blocking boards , mattresses , towel-covered tables , foam floor mats , cork boardsyou people had a zillion creative ideas for this , as we discussed last week . <p> Some means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose ( see below ) , you will need one of the following : spray bottle for spraying , sink big enough to immerse the piece , wet towels , or an iron or garment steamer . <p> Something to measure with .

This is to guide you in coaxing the piece into its proper size and shape as you block . <p> Pins . Some people swear by using blocking wires , or strong cotton thread , to help eliminate pin-marks and scalloped edges . Try them if you have them . Whatever you use , make sure all materials are both waterproof and rustproof . <p> Step 2 : Weave in your ends ! Really . Take a deep breath and just do it .

Tip for weaving in slippery yarns : The Bonsai is knitted out of a lovely , silky bamboo ribbon yarn , so when weaving in the ends , I used my yarn needle to pierce individual strands of the last few stitches I was weaving into , in order to lock the ends securely into place . <p> Use the schematic as a guide <p> Step 3 : Check the pattern measurements . Look at the schematic , if there is one ; otherwise , look to see what the " finished measurements " section says . Measurement tip : If you made alterations to the pattern , you made notes along the way , right ? Of course you did ! Make sure that you account for any changes you made , such as a slightly different gauge , or customizations , when you block . <p> Step 4 : Decide which wetting method is best for your knitting . You can spray , steam , soak , or roll in wet towels to get your knitting wet . Which method you use depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch pattern , garment type , and your personal experience and preferences . But which is the BEST method ? The best method is the one that gives you the results you want with that particular yarn and stitch combination . ( Sorry .

Right ! ) , and then experimenton a SWATCH , of course , not on the cabled pullover it took you months to knit ( see , swatches are good for something besides driving us knitters insane ) . <p> The most important thing about learning to block your knitting is : It 's YOUR KNITTING .

We are going to use " nonferrous " metals , meaning that all of these metals belong to the same iron-free family and therefore can be treated the same way when used for making jewelry . Specifically I am using copper , brass ( an alloy of copper and zinc ) and nickel ( an alloy of copper , nickel , and zinc ) . See the common thread with these metals ? Yep , its copper . Think of these metals as a bunch of cousins belonging to the same family but with very distinct personalities . <p> If you have worked with sterling silver in jewelry making before , you 'll see that copper , brass , and nickel act in a similar manner due to their copper content .

It is hard to control where solder paste flows , so special attention must be paid to the amount applied and where it is placed .

Clean and polish just as you would when you use silver solder . <p> Copper Wire Solder Finally let me introduce you to copper wire solder . Remember these all contain flux , so copper wire solder is also ready to use . It comes in one flow point , so again it is perfect for soldering single-step copper pieces .

If your bezel wire ends do n't match up perfectly , you 'll have a noticeable gap between the ends of it that solder will not fill . So you can see why getting bezel wire ends to be perfectly straight and match up juuuust right is so important . <p> Photo by Wendi Beauford . <p> The key to creating perfect bezel wire ends is in the cutting .

If so , what scissors are best ? <p> Photo by Micah Jones . <p> Lexi The Soldering Queen 's answer : <p> The very best bezel scissors are dental scissors . They will cut a hair 's width of bezel .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a minute amount of silver that they save countless hours . <p> On bezels , remember , they must fit vertically as well as horizontally . Most jewelers only fit it vertically , from side to side . But they have to fit smoothly on the top and bottom , too . Also , do not make a bezel to fit exactly . This must be one of the biggest secrets in all of jewelry-making-dom , because it 's written in most of the books that the bezel must fit snugly . Then you solder it down , it shrinks , and you can not get the stone in the bezel any more . <p> Photo by Michele Grady . <p> I teach this in my classes at BeadFest . When you fit your bezel around the stone , the easiest way to do it is with your fingers . Anything else just takes up time and does n't give you an accurate measurement .

Some bezel is not sold dead soft and must be annealed before you bend it , or it will keep springing open . Hauser and Miller 's bezel is dead soft , but David H. Fell 's bezel needs to be annealed .

If everything is aligned properly , the bezel wire will look like it is going straight through the nippers , and if not , it will look bent in the reflection .

You can also sand the surface of the resin for a matte finish , if you prefer it . Resin can also be a faux counter enamel to provide strength on the reverse of an enameled piecewhile also allowing any heat patinas that form there during firing to show . <p> For a fragile patina like rust or verdi gris , Susan recommends just spraying with matte medium or some type of spray fixative . Anything else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of patinas . <p> For a quick and easy sealant , clear nail polish is her go-to sealant , because the alcohol in it makes for a short drying time . <p> Susan also shares that she does n't  usually seal a piece right away , she gives it a day or two to move into its natural state before sealing it . I think this is a wise point , because generally once its sealed , there 's little chance of changing it . If you give a piece a day or two to rest , you 'll see if anything is going to change and maybe have a shot at altering it before sealing it for good . @qwx186333 @qwx186323 @qwx186336 @qwx186338 @qwx186324 
@@14364112 @2964112/ <h> Cutting the Steek , Step-by-Step <p> I cut my knitting , and the sweater survived , and no one fainted , and in the end , it was n't as big a deal as I thought it would be . ( Two cups of coffee , max . No chocolate required , not even afterwards . No alcohol required . Strictly PG-13 . ) <p> I recommend Eunny Jang 's article " SteeksCutting the Edge " ( " Beyond the Basics , " Interweave Knits Winter 2006 ) as a reference for learning the basics of steeking . I ended up having this article open on the table next to me for every stitch and snip . <p> Ready to cut ! <p> I learned that cutting your knitting is all about the preparation ; if you prepare the knitting properly , then the cutting itself is a bit of an anticlimaxa few snips and the deed is done ! <p> Here are step-by-step photos of how I " steeked " the body of my Farmer 's Market Cardigan . Just remember : The steek is n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment in converting a flat pattern to knitting-in-the-round . ( So far , so good ! ) <p> SHOWN HERE : <p> The green dotted line shows the cutting line . <p> The blue arrows point to the purl ridges marking the " foldover " for each edge . <p> You can see the columns of neck decreases off to the side of each purl turning ridge . <h> Step 1 : First line of stitching ( and materials ) <p> To prepare a piece of knitting for cutting , you need to secure the stitches in the steek panel so they do not come undone when you cut them . <p> To secure my knitted stitches , I sewed VERTICALLY between columns of stitches , splitting the knitting yarn as I went . <p> Sewing materials : At first , I tried using embroidery floss and a sharp-pointed needle , as shown here . As I sewed , I noticed that the floss was slipping through the yarn really easilybut I did n't want something that slipped easily through the yarn , as the stitches might just slip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that worked beautifully . ( The sock yarn also shows up in the photos better . ) <p> Method : I backstitched from bottom to top of the steek panel , between the two columns of stitches as shown . <p> Stitch placement : My first stitching line was one full stitch-width away from the cutting line . <h> Step 2 : Second and third stitching lines <p> Next , I stitched two more vertical lines , each one-half column away from either side of the cutting line . I followed the middle of each column of stitches as shown here , again backstitching with sock yarn . <p> IMPORTANT HINT : As you stitch , pierce the yarn strands of the sweater with the sewing needle . Do n't sew between the strands of your knitted stitches , pierce the strands themselves so that the yarn splits . The twist and stickiness of the knitting yarn will help hold the sewn stitches in place . <h> Step 3 : Final line of stitching <p> I made a fourth line of vertical stitches , this timeone full stitch-width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo , you can see three of my four vertical lines of stitching . Remember that you ca n't see the first line of stitches , as the embroidery floss I used for the first try disappeared into the knitting . <p> And then I was ready to cut ! <h> Step 4 : Beginning to cut <p> Using a small , sharp pair of scissors , I made that first somewhat-scary cutonly to realize that I could Trust The Stitches and snip away happily ( but slowly ) . <p> Why did I use a small ( rather than large ) pair of scissors ? I found I could get better control and accuracyit was easier to " aim " the blades so they cut exactly where I wanted them to cut . <p> TIPS : <p> Go slowly . <p> Snip no more than about two stitches at a time . <p> Place the tips of the scissors carefully between stitch columns , and check before you cut that only the horizontal bars are between the scissor blades . <p> Here 's a close-up of the scissor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitching lines to the left of the scissors . You can make out one line of stitching to the right , but the other stitching line is hidden . <p> Here 's what the knitting looked like as I cut into it . <p> What about the ragged edges ? Remember , the steek panel itself will become a facingthe edges will be turned under at the purl ridge . Then I will whipstitch the raw edges down . The shawl collar and pockets will cover the front edges here so nothing will show . <p> Almost thereno chocolate has been needed ( yet ) <p> And I 'm done ! The raw edges here are rolling under all by themselves at the purl ridge , eager and ready to become a neat little facing . <p> I folded the edges under neatly at the purl ridge in this photo so you could see what it might look like after I have finished whipstitching the facing into place . <p> Every knitter has dreamed of the perfect cardigan pattern that he or she might knit some day .

@@14364113 @2964113/ <h> 6 Tips for Successful Hammered Wirework <p> Months ago , I got so excited about advancing my wire wrapping techniques beyond wire-wrapped loops that I had a big success-turned-failure . I did n't  have a mandrel or some of the other cool ( and necessary ) tools it takes to do slightly more advanced wire jewelry designs , so I rummaged through the garage toolbox and improvised.I dove right in and reached for a ball-peen hammer from the toolbox . In my stash , I had plenty of wire in various gauges , including 22-gauge half-hard , my favorite . Also , I did n't  have a steel bench block . But that did n't  stop me . I had a large hoop earring finding with five holes in it that just begged for dangles to be inserted . I envisioned five long wire wrapped dangles with a few beads strung on them for color and flared wire ends to hold the beads in place . I grabbed a piece of compressed wood board , my hammer , and headed for the studio . <p> Intrepid Wireworker Skips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding would only accommodate 24-gauge wire , I rationalized that the end results would be " delicate . " The word I did n't  consider at the time was " flimsy . " I attached five long pieces of wire to each hole with wire wraps . Then I strung a pewter size 11 seed , a small aquamarine rondelle , and a pearly blue size 8 seed bead to each . Last , I hammered a 1/2 " length at the tip of each wire until it flared at the end . A modern masterpiece ! <p> ( Check out the photo of those earrings today . They are , as my engineer friend , Michael , would say , " structurally unsound . " ) 6 Tips for Successful Hammered Wirework <p> Recently , while filming Beads , Baubles &amp; Jewels , I asked Mark Nelson from Rio Grande to demo how to make hammered wire dangles .

Here are Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more foraging in the garage toolbox . here 's why . The ball end and the flat end of the ball-peen hammer should be smooth . Scratches and dents in the hammer and hammering surface transfer to the metal . If you 've been wailing on walls with yours , forget about making jewelry with it . <p> Use a suitable wire gauge : That 24-gauge wire was too fine . A 20-gauge dead-soft wire is probably the thinnest wire to use for a nice flared-end dangle : 16- or 18-gauge would be even better . <p> Be gentle with metal : Do n't  whang away on your wire . As you use thicker gauges of wire , you will increase your hammering pressure a little . A gentle touch does the joband spreads the metal evenly for equal strength and a better look . <p> Do n't  let your first idea dictate your materials : Creating dangles was a good idea .

@@14364116 @2964116/ <h> Tips for Perfect Crimps <p> I 've seen some pretty bad crimping jobs since I started making beaded jewelry . My own first crimps were pretty darn bad , too . I used the wrong kind of crimp , and I never used a crimping pliers . ( I did n't even know what a pair of crimping pliers WAS ! ) My strung jewelry would fall apart after just a few wears , and I did n't know what to do about it . Enter the crimping pliers , one of my favorite jewelry making tools , and probably the most important jewelry making tool for making professional-looking beaded jewelry . Especially if you want to sell your beaded jewelry , learning how to properly use your crimping pliers is important for making beaded jewelry that will last . <p> First , let 's review the basics of proper crimping : <p> First , we need to get to know your crimping pliers a little better . If you look inside , you 'll see that there are two wells : one with a little notch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For successful crimping , you 'll use both of these wells to fasten and secure your crimp bead . <p> The first thing you want to do when you insert your beading wire into the crimp bead is to make sure that the strands of the beading wire do not cross . They should be lined up next to each other . <p> Place the crimp into the notched well of your crimping pliers and press down firmly . You should now have a little indent in the middle of your crimp bead . <p> Turn the crimp bead sideways and place it into the smooth well of your crimping pliers . Gently squeeze the sides of the crimp bead together , like closing the pages of a book . Sometimes I 'll place the closed crimp in the very tips of my crimping pliers and give it one more gentle squeeze to make sure that it 's securely closed . <p> Like any important skill for making beaded jewelry , learning how to close your crimp beads properly takes time and practice . Once you have the basics mastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished crimp beads look more professional : <p> Use crimp covers . These tiny little round findings are designed to slip over your crimps and can be closed gently using a pair of flat nose pliers . <p> Do n't scrimp on your crimps . The price of sterling silver and other precious metals is going up , but you should still insist on buying precious metal crimps for your beaded jewelry . High-quality crimp beads will not only give your beaded jewelry a professional looking finish , but they will also make it less likely that your beaded jewelry will fall apart . <p> Match your crimps and your beading wire . If you do n't use french bullion to cover the ends of your beading wire , make sure that your crimps match your beading wire . Maybe I 'm the only one who feels this way , but it makes me nuts to see a gold-filled crimp on a piece of silver beading wire . <p> Make your loop large enough . Before you smash your crimp , insert a beading awl or another similar beading tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want to have your loop so tight that you ca n't move the clasp in order to open and close it . <p> Reduce the stress on your beading wire . One way to prevent excess wear on your finished piece of beaded jewelry is to string an accent bead after your crimp and before your clasp . Adding a bead between the clasp and the crimp will keep the beading wire from rubbing up against the crimp bead . <p> Do you have a favorite style or brand of crimp bead ?

Be careful not to melt silver accent balls when fusing them onto a base . If you hold the flame directly on the ball for too long , it could simply melt into a liquid mess . Be sure to keep the flame moving so that you heat the entire piece gradually until it turns red ; then focus your flame a little more directly onto the area being fusedbut do n't linger there too long . <p> 5 .

@@14364122 @2964122/ <h> Knitting Terms : Throwing or Picking ? <p> I was flipping through our new special issue Interweave Knits:Weekend , and thinking about how much I usually look forward to knitting on the weekend ; " usually " is the key word here , because I 've got a project that I 'm ready to be finished with . Its a complicated cabled scarf that I 'm doing for someone else , and its one of those projects that is challenging- to work on and beautiful once its done . You know I love a cable project , but I cant wait to get back to my regular weekend knitting ! <p> As I 've been working on this project , I 've been using two methods of knitting : throwing and picking . When I first learned to knit I was a " thrower . " What was I throwing , you ask ? Well , I was throwing the yarn around the needle , I guess . I really was n't actually throwing the yarn around the needle , but " throwing " is a common term for what 's been known for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , I noticed a couple of the gals were holding the yarn in their left hands and sort of scooping it through the loop to make their knit stitches , and they were doing it pretty speedily ! ( This is the Continental method of knitting , also known as " picking . " ) <p> I asked for a lesson , and discovered my tension , which had been perfectly even , by the way ; ) , went crazy : loose stitches everywhere ! I decided to practice my picking skills on a felted bag , which is so forgiving ; once its felted , the loose stitches disappear . The bag gave me enough practice to improve my tension and get me comfortable with this new method . And the speed was amazing ! Purling was n't quite as fast as knitting for awhile , but I 'm adept at both stitches now . <p> The surprise in all of this was what a bonus it is to be able to pick and throw . Working on stranded projects is the most obvious use of both methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more control over the yarn , such as when doing large cable crossings ( more than four stitches crossing over , such as my current scarf project ) , - picking up stitches , and knitting or purling more than two stitches together for lace projects . I default to picking now , but I love having the throwing knowledge in my arsenal . <p> How Do We Knit ? <p> One day we decided to take photos of how we here at Knitting Daily knit so we could share them with you . Clockwise from left is Marilyn ( a thrower ) , Annie ( a thrower ) , me ( a picker ) , Anna-Liza ( a picker ) , Rebecca ( a thrower ) , and Eunny ( throwing and picking on a stranded project ) . <p> - - - - - - - - - <p> Even though we all either pick or throw , we each have a different way of tensioning our yarn . This is one of the reasons that gauge is so important when working on garments " there are infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some less , resulting in tighter or looser stitches . <p> Learn to Pick ( or Throw ) ! <p> If you 're a thrower , here 's a quick lesson on picking : <p> To knit : Hold the working yarn behind the needles and use your right hand to bring the right needle into the first stitch on the left needle ( from front to back ) , rotate it counterclockwise ( over and behind in a scooping motion ) around the taut working yarn , and back out of the stitch , pulling the new stitch through the old as you slide the old stitch off the left needle ( Fig. 2 ) . <p> To purl : Hold the yarn in front of the work and insert the right needle behind the yarn and down ( from back to front ) into the first stitch on the left needle . Rotate the right needle around the yarn counterclockwise ( over , behind , and around to the front again ) , then push the needle to the back , pulling the new stitch through the old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so ( Fig. 1 ) . Some knitters find it helpful to use their right thumb or forefinger to prevent the yarn from sliding off the tip of the right needle as they pull the stitch through . Others like to move their left forefinger downward slightly to hold the new stitch in place as it is pulled through to completion . <p> If you 're a picker , here 's a quick lesson on throwing : <p> To knit : Hold the working yarn in back of the work and insert the right needle up ( from front to back ) into the first stitch on the left needle , so that the needle tip extends about an inch ( 2.5 cm ) beyond the stitch . Grasp the right needle with your left thumb and forefinger ( without letting go of the left needle ) , bring the yarn forward with your right forefinger , and wrap it around the right needle tip counterclockwise ( behind the needle then to the front between the two needles ) Fig. 3 . Retrieve the right needle with your right hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as you slide the old stitch off the left needle . Tighten the yarn with your right hand to tension the stitch . <p> To purl : Hold the yarn in front and insert the right needle " down " ( from back to front ) into the stitch , so that the tip extends about an inch ( 2.5 cm ) beyond the stitch . Grasp the right needle with your left thumb and forefinger as you use your right forefinger to wrap the yarn around the right needle tip counterclockwise ( over and behind the needle , then to the front between the two needles ) Fig. 4 . Move both hands back into their starting position as you use the right needle to draw the new stitch through the old and off the needle . Tighten the stitch with your right hand . <p> As you practice these new techniques , you 'll feel like you 're a beginning knitter again " all thumbs wrapped up in string . Just keep at it , remembering to breath and relax your shoulders . And pick a project " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else thatll be forgiving but ultimately useful " and throw or pick away .

" <p> A Smooth Finish : The Applied I-cord <p> One of the best uses of the I-cord is in finishing . The technique is called " applied I-cord " ( or sometimes " attached I-cord " ) and it gives you a really smooth , nice-looking finish that 's perfect around armholes and necklines . <p> With garments right side facing and using a separate ball of yarn and circular needle , pick up the desired number of stitches along the garment edge . Slide these stitches down the needle so that the first picked-up stitch is near the opposite needle point . With a double-pointed needle , cast on the desired number of I-cord stitches .

Knit across the I-cord to the last stitch , then knit the last stitch together through the back loop with the first picked-up stitch on the garment . <p> Step 4 . Continue in this manner until all picked-up stitches have been used . <p> here 's a video tutorial , which includes the infamous I cord bind off ! <p> I 've seen the applied I-cord used well on felted bags , too . The bags are sometimes finished with two applied I-cords on top of one another , which felts into a sturdy , rounded border around the opening of the bag .

Then I come home and dump out my bag and , well , cuss . <p> The downfall of these little gems is their unstable finishes that can rub off or fadeit makes their beauty fleeting . Sometimes the change is caused by abrasion with other beads , thread , or skin ; other times its from sunlight ; and often it can happen from a chemical reaction with the oil in your skin . <p> The easiest way to find out if a bead is dyed is to ask the vendor . Most list that information right on the label with a " D.

If so , the bead is dyed . <p> Metallic , or galvanized beads , are much like dyed beads in that they are made by treating the surface with a coating to give it a shiny metal look .

However : In this case , there are misplaced cables where there is supposed to be only stockinette stitch , and cables use a slightly different amount of yarn over the same span as stockinette does .

That 's where the mattress stitch comes in ! <p> Garter stitch selvage edge . <p> My favorite knitting technique for making beautiful finished garments and the one I use- almost exclusively ( that means " all the time " unless a pattern specifically recommends another method ! ) is the mattress stitch . I have no idea why this seaming process is called the " mattress stitch " ; if any of you know , please leave a comment ! <h> Preparing to Seam <p> Its important to have a good selvage edge . When I learned to knit , a smart , experienced knitter told me to always knit the first and last stitch of every row . This makes a garter stitch selvage edge which is easy to see when you 're seaming . You do n't  have to add extra stitches , just knit the first and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting a P2/K2 rib , I just knit the first stitch then knit 1 , purl 2 , knit 2 , and so on . <p> Before you begin seaming , you should block all of your pieces so the selvage edge is easily accessible . I usually use a steamer to block my garments , but some folks swear by wet blocking , too , so use whichever method you like best . <p> I usually seam a garment with the same yarn I use to knit it . However , if the yarn used in the knitting is not quite suitable for seaming ( like a novelty yarn , a yarn that pulls apart easily , or a bulky yarn ) you might need to use something else . I find that Cascade 220 comes in a wide enough range of colors to suit . If you 're working on a lightweight piece and need thinner yarn for seaming , try using embroidery thread . The color range is endless and the thread is really strong . Some folks also use one or two plies of the garment yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Knitting Seams Together : Mattress Stitch Made Easy <p> One of my favorite knitters , Kathy Veeza ( a.k.a " Grumperina " ) , wrote a wonderful article in the spring 2008 Knitscene , which you can download now ! ) , all about seaming .

Repeat from * to the end of the seam , finishing by picking up the last bar ( or pair of bars ) at the top of the first piece . <p> The secret to streamlined seams is always working mattress stitch from the same vertical column . Never veer to the right or left of the seaming line " the stitch adjacent to the seam should be fully visible from base to top along the whole seam . If you veer into that stitch or farther away from it as you seam , your seam will zigzag in a distracting way . When seaming a sleeve into an armhole , make sure to follow this rule on the body pieces . <p> The most important step to making perfect knit seams comes after the sewing is done .

You may also lightly steam the seams to achieve the same result , taking the utmost care if your sweater is wool . <p> Knitting finished , pieces seamed , and seams streamlined : now you 're ready to show everyone your new sweater , proudly announcing that- yes , you knit it yourself " thoughtfully , methodically , lovingly , and with seams that will stand up to scrutiny every time you look in the mirror .

The problem is that most patterns are written so that row 1 , the row you do immediately after you cast on , is the right side of your fabric , leaving the purl bumps on the right side , and row 2 is the wrong side , leaving the nicer looking stitches from your cast-on on the back of the work . Lots of knitters simply make row 1 the wrong side of the work , which is a fine solution with 9 out of 10 patterns .

Her " best clasp " question is one of those questions that seems on the surface to be quick and easy .

I 'd love to know what you think about bracelet claspsplease share your own ideas in the comments section . Thanks ! Michelle Mach , Beading Daily editor . <p> Q : I have a question about bracelet clasps . I see lots of bracelets with the toggle bar clasps , but when I gave one to my friend she lost it for awhile . ( Luckily , she did find it . ) The next bracelets I gave away had a magnetic clasp and a box clasp respectively . One girl lost the magnetic one never to be found again and the box clasp broke . What is the best clasp that we can attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ! I 'm not sure there is a perfect claspmuch depends upon how often the piece will be worn , the weight of the bracelet , and the activeness of the recipient . Here are my thoughts on six types of clasps : <p> Toggle clasps require tension to keep them closed . This makes them a great choice for necklaces , since you have the collected weight of all the beads at the front of the necklace keeping the clasp shut . If your bracelet uses small , lightweight beads like freshwater pearls , then you might not have enough tension to keep the toggle closed . <p> I use magnetic clasps for much of my personal jewelry because they are so easy to open . But Nicole 's rightthey still can get lost . One beader I know went to a conference where she sat in a metal folding chair . The magnetic clasp attached itself to the chair and slipped off her wrist without her noticing . Jean Campbell , author of Getting Started Stringing Beads , advises that magnetic clasps should only be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use magnetic clasps on pieces to be worn by people with pacemakers . <p> A lobster clasp or spring ring clasp requires you to push a lever down to open clasp . An inexpensive option , these clasps can be difficult to open . Sometimes the bottom ring of the clasp can be weak and subject to breaking , particularly on spring ring clasps . <p> Box clasps often have inlaid gemstones or other designs that make them a beautiful finishing touch to a beaded bracelet . One half of a box clasp is hollowed out , while the other has a strip of metal that has been folded over . This metal tab slides into the hollow box with a snap . On high-end jewelry , I 've seen safety catches added for extra security . <p> Pearl clasps combine both a fishhook clasp and a locking box mechanism , which means that there 's a backup if the box mechanism fails . <p> Author of Findings and Finishings , Sharon Bateman writes about the fold-over clasp : " Even the most active person will have trouble snagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of this type of clasp is pushed down until it snaps over the bottom half .

While I 've known about resin for a long time , I did n't  actually use the two-part epoxy type until earlier this year when I volunteered to make a resin-filled ring for Handcrafted Jewelry magazine , our eMags older sister . In fact , the aforementioned resin article was my impetus " it calmed my fears ( How do I tame this finicky material ? Will I keel over from breathing it ? ) and gave me the confidence to give resin a go . <p> My first attempts at using two-part epoxy resin did n't  produce perfect results ( that 's my ring , above ) , but I was surprised at how easy the material was to work with . Let me share the top five resin jewelry making tips I learned or came up with along the way ! <p> 1 . Use your bezel as a stamp . Cutting out paper to fit inside a bezel is n't easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out shapes to fit perfectly inside their bezels . I came up with my own solution : Ink up your bezel in a stamp pad just as you would a rubber stamp and then use it to stamp on your paper ( or whatever material you 're putting inside your bezel ) . Wash and dry your bezel thoroughly to remove all the ink ; then use scissors to cut along the inside the of stamp mark . Trim as necessary . <p> 2 . Seal , seal , and seal again . If you do n't  want resin to seep into your paper , you must cover it with sealant , such as Mod Podge . Seal the top , bottom , and sides and apply several coats , allowing the sealant to dry between coats ( this does n't  take long at all ) . I did n't  seal my paper well enough the first time , and a bit of resin seeped into my paper , making that area look a little darker than the rest-a big bummer for a perfectionist like myself . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous one . Because I liked everything about my ring design except the small dark patch where resin seeped into the paper , I really wanted to salvage it . Cynthia Thorntons amazing Enchanted Adornments book to the rescue ! In it I had remembered reading about Cynthias technique for creating a satin finish on dried resin : You simply rub the resin surface with 600- then 2000-grit wet/dry sandpapers until you achieve the desired " matte-ness . " Surely Cynthia uses this technique for its visual effect , but its a great way to camouflage mistakes , too ! <p> 4 . Soda bottles make- great ring platforms . When it was time to pour the resin into my rings bezel , I realized I needed to find a way keep the ring steady and upright . A plastic soda bottle did the trick " the shank fit into the opening while the bezel rested perfectly on top . I filled the bottle with sand so it would n't tip over . If I had channeled my dad , I might have thought of taping the ring to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station wagon together , so I 'm sure it could affix a ring to a table . <p> 5 . Room temperature does matter . I admit that I mentally rolled my eyes when I read in Susan Lenart Kazmers instructions for her two-part epoxy Ice Resin that an optimal room temperature for mixing resin is 72-F . My first resin projects turned out great . They were created in late summer when it was probably at least 80-F in my studio . However . . . when some coworkers and I were playing with resin in the " studio " ( read : basement ) here at work where it was maybe 40-F , the bubbles that formed in the resin did n't  dissipate . That 's because its the heat that pulls them to the surface , apparently . Okay , Susan , I guess you 're right ! To fix this problem , I 've learned I could have set the resin under a warm task light or popped any bubbles that remained with a toothpick or piece of wire within about a half hour after pouring .

But the type of thread you buy is just as important as the beads themselves . Thread truly is the backbone of an off-loom or loomed piece of beadwork , so should be considered carefully . <p> If you 're not sure about what type you should use , the best place to start is the materials list in your projects instructions . The suggested beading thread is usually your best bet . As you learn more about beading thread , though , you 'll likely discover your individual preference . For instance , I used to only use Nymo or C-Lon . I liked the color selection and the silky feel .

Beaders love it for seed bead work because its strong , but its also enough like silk that the resulting beadwork is soft and supple , too . Its made up of many twisted fibers of nylon . Its most often available at bead shops by the bobbin in 00 , 0 , B , and D widths ( thinnest to thickestuse 00 for projects with small beads and lots of thread passes , D for wider-holed beads and few passes ) . It comes in a rainbow of colors , so its easy to match the thread to your beads . This thread tends to fray , so use lots of beeswax or thread conditioner to keep the fibers stuck together . It also stretches while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you start stitching . <p> C-Lon is a very strong polymer thread . It has all the same qualities of Nymo , but is slightly stronger and comes in a larger number of colors . <p> Silamide is another nylon thread . This one was originally made for the upholstery industryits a pre-waxed thread that feels slightly different than Nymo because its got a twisted two-ply . You 'll most often find it at bead shops on cards , but you can also buy it in spools . There are many different colors to choose from , but not as many as Nymo and C-Lon . Even though this thread is pre-waxed , another light coat of beeswax will ensure the plies stick together . <p> PowerPro was first made for the fishing industry , so it comes in " tests " , which relates to how big of a fish you plan on catching ! Its a crazy strong braided thread that is silky like Nymo , C-Lon , and Silamide , but it does n't  stretch . This stuff could just about pull a bus ( do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use with abrasive beads like bugles and crystals because it does n't  abrade like the other more traditional beading threads . It comes on spools , but only in white and moss . If you must have color , press the end of a length of white under a Sharpie in a color to match your beads and pull the thread through for instant colored thread . Since its so strong , it can be difficult to cutthe best way is with a childrens Fiskars scissors . This one is also tricky to thread , so if you 're impatient like me , you may want to try a Big-Eye needle for projects with PowerPro . Most beaders use a 10-pound test , which would work well for weaving a nice bracelet orcatching a delicious bass . <p> FireLine is another thread born out of the fishing industry .

I own a drawer full of assorted lentils , bars , triangles , squares , and cubes in a rainbow of colors . The problem ? I do n't  always know how best to use them . This is especially true of the two-hole beads , which add a layer of complexity . I know that I can always string them for an easy necklace .

In the " Artist Spotlight : Cindy Holsclaw " interview , Cindy states , " As with my interest in beadwork , in my studies I was most drawn to interesting chemical forms and structuresand I enjoy creating the same forms with beads . " I am not a scientist ( except occasionally an accidental one with forgotten foods in my refrigerator ! ) , but learning about Cindys passion made me look more closely at my own interests . Maybe shaped beads could be my launching pad to exploring beaded versions of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ? Or maybe instead of cursing the dandelions that are springing up on my lawn , I could try to study one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bar beads are a good choice for your first design with two-hole shaped beads . <h> Choose the Right Beads <p> Not all two-hole beads work best for all designs . In her DVD Weaving Beaded Beads with Two-Hole Beads , Cindy starts with two-hole CzechMate bar beads . These symmetrical beads have evenly spaced holes , making them easier to use in a jewelry design . In contrast , triangle beads with their pair of holes only on one side are more challenging to use . This is n't to say you should n't use them , but maybe save them for your second two-hole bead design . <h> Change Elements One at a Time <p> When doing a scientific experiment , you need to be able to track which changes lead to which results . Its better to make small changes one at a time rather than a bunch of changes all at once . The same basic principles can help you make your own jewelry design a success . Change the shape of just one bead , for example , to see if you like the results before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but challenging . If a bead weaving design is n't working , I might normally change the colors , sizes , and bead shapes all at the same time . My reasoning is that I 'm saving time by efficiently doing everything at once , but when my experiment does n't  work ( as it often does n't  ) , then I 'm unsure about the next step . Should I change the bead shape again ? The color ? The bead size ? Sometimes its not clear . <p> By changing a single element such as bead size , you can create a dynamic necklace . <h> Forget About Failure <p> What is the worst that can happen ? Even if you end up dismantling the whole necklace or bracelet , you 'll have learned something that will serve you in the next beading project .

In the Artist Spotlight : Cindy Holsclaw- interview , Cindy notes , " Although I like the overall project to have a pleasing color theme that does n't  look like its colors are clashing , a colorway also needs to have contrast in tone and hue to add interest . A great solution is to use both matte and shiny finishes in the same project to emphasize some areas and de-emphasize others .
