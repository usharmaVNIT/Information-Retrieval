@@35577665 @4577665/ <p> We all watch the news and see reports on Facebook of the latest crimes that happen in our home towns . But it can be hard to tell at a big picture level how dangerous our town actually is . <p> In order to help Virginians " and future Virginians " know just how close they are to danger , we took data from the annual FBI report and did some serious data analysis . <p> The data shows that these ten places are currently the most dangerous in Virginia : <p> Portsmouth <p> South Boston <p> Norfolk <p> Appalachia <p> Roanoke <p> Emporia <p> Richmond <p> Franklin <p> Petersburg <p> Tappahannock <p> Read on for a detailed explanation of the data and analysis we used in creating this ranking , along with more information on the top ten places . 169987 @qwx369987 <h> How We Determined The Most Dangerous Places In Virginia <p> While there are surveys and public polls on what cities in a state are the most dangerous , we did n't want to rely on speculation and opinion . Instead , we looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reporting . <p> Specifically , we analyzed the FBI 's Uniform Crime Report which summarizes the number of property crimes and violent crimes in each city per year . <h> 1 . Portsmouth <p> Portsmouth claims the dubious distinction as the most dangerous place in Virginia according to our analysis . <p> Home to a large navy facility and , it 's name sake , a large port , these institutions may0 contribute to the to large incidence of crime . <p> For the past 3 years of available data , Portsmouth ranked second in both violent crimes and property crimes . Residents had about a 1 in 18.7 chance of being a victim of a property crime in any one of the past three years . <h> 2 . South Boston <p> Source : Wikimedia <p> Population : 8,048 <p> Violent Crime Rank : 9Property Crime Rank : 3 <p> South Boston is a relatively small town in the southern part of the state , but with an outsized amount of property crime . For a town of only 8,000 people , it registers about 400 property crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> The main attraction in the town is the South Boston Speedway and it 's not too far of a stretch to think that the visitors for races contribute to the crime rate in the city more so than the full time residents . <h> 3 . Norfolk <p> Source : Flickr user conner395 <p> Population : 247,303 <p> Violent Crime Rank : 3Property Crime Rank : 12 <p> Just on the other side of the Elizabeth River from Portsmouth , Norfolk comes in 3rd on our list of most dangerous cities in Virginia . <p> Kind of like a semi , underachieving older brother , Norfolk has slightly less violent crime per person and substantially less property crime per person . <p> Again , the large incidence of crime in this city can probably be attributed to the outsize number of people coming through the port . And , like all cities , there are rougher sections and nicer sections . <h> 4 .

Roanoke 169998 @qwx369998 <p> Population:97,927 <p> Violent Crime Rank : 6Property Crime Rank : 9 <p> Roanoke is the principal municipality of the Roanoke Metropolitan Statistical Area and it 's also the principal location of crime in the area . <p> Coming in at number 5 on our list of most dangerous places in Virginia , residents of Roanoke had a 1 in 19.36 chance of being the victim of a crime . <p> Acting as a commercial hub for Southwest Virginia , the freight rail industry is a major component of Roanoke 's economy . This industry may also contribute to the higher than average crime rate of the city . <h> 6 . Emporia 169998 @qwx369998 <p> Population : 5,673 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike the last three places on the list , Emporia actually ranks higher for property crime per capita than it does it for violent crime per capita . <p> While it is a known speed trap with rigorous enforcement of speeding laws , it is also a relative hot bed for the occurrence of crime . <p> As the FBI aggregates crime data based on reporting from local municipalities , it would n't surprise us if Emporia ranks highly simply because the police department does an excellent job of reporting crimes that occur within its city limits . <h> 7 .

This level of industrialization may contribute to the higher occurrences of crime within the city . <h> 9 . Petersburg 169998 @qwx369998 <p> Population : 31,847 <p> Violent Crime Rank : 5Property Crime Rank : 22 <p> Petersburg ranks number nine on our list because of the prevalence of violent crime within the city . <p> It is an important transportation hub in the state of Virginia . It houses both CSX and NX rail systems , in addition to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major interstate highways that run through the city . <p> The sheer volume of people passing through the city probably contributes to the high occurrence of violent crime within the city . <h> 10 .

A score of 90 means its 10% less expensive . <p> San Francisco has a score of 243 meaning its almost 2.5 times as expensive as the average place in the country . 
@@35577834 @4577834/ <p> The Powerball is at like a billion dollars . Science says these are the best cities in OR to buy your tickets . <p> Are you feeling lucky ? <p> Chance are , if you live in Oregon , you 've played the Oregon Lottery at least once in your life . You may even have even considered your luck ' factor when it comes to your chances for striking it rich . <p> But did you know that , statistically , some cities in Oregon have a greater chance of winning ? Based on population numbers and winning results , some cities are luckier ' than others . HomeSnacks is the first site to figure it all out , and we 've got the winning formula below . <p> Hint : It 's certainly not Portland . Not even close . Read on below to see how these cities ranked , and how we compiled the math . <p> According to scientific data , these are the 10 luckiest cities in Oregon : <p> Wamic <p> Nehalem <p> Cloverdale <p> La Pine <p> Milwaukie <p> Newport <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How we compiled the luckies cities in Oregon <p> In order to determine which cities are lucky ' , all we had to do was see how many winners there have been over the course of time , and weigh in a population factor . <p> In this case , we decided that $25,000 or more winners on scratchers or draw games in the last ten years made sense . Then , we calculated how many $25,000 winners there have been per resident in Oregon cities . And just like magic , our winners emerged . <p> We also gave a heavier weight to bigger wins , meaning a $1,000,000 payout is considered a lot luckier than a $25,000 payout . <p> If your home town is n't in the top 10 , do n't worry , you can scroll to the bottom to see where all Oregon cities ranked . And here 's a tip : Smaller towns have much better odds , statistically . There have also been an unusually high number of lucky towns on the Pacific coast . 169987 @qwx369987 <h> 1 .

Actually , this part of the state is apparently really happy since Sioux Center was 2nd on the list . <p> What makes Orange City such a skippity-do-da place ?

What makes West Des Moines a relatively happy place ? They are 10th in college degrees ( 79% ) , and 9th in income levels . <p> What sets it back ? The cost of living is just about the highest in the state , and only 58% of the population owns a home . Plus , crime is about average . <p> Nearby Des Moines might not be happy to hear that they 're not so happy " at least in the grand scheme of things . Why ? It 's the 10th most dangerous place , according to the FBI . Yes , we 're aware that dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Illinois .

If you 're from Texas , you brag about it . If you 've made Los Angeles your home , typically , most of the people in your life are aware that you 're from L.A. <p> What about your zip code ? Often , only the wise , shrewd home buyer is aware that within individual zip codes of America are individually-wrapped nuggets of information that can make the difference between a good place to call home and a great place to call home . <p> You might think people across the nation like to think they live in the best place in the country . After all , you would n't spend your lives somewhere that you truly did n't love . Right ? Not always . In fact , according to a Pew Research Center study not too long ago determined that almost half of Americans would rather live somewhere else than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the zip codes we 're about to highlight , odds are you do n't want to go anywhere . <p> The purpose of this study is to use science to determine which of our great American zip codes are the absolute best . While unbiased , this research does take into account factors that almost all Americans would agree are desirable . Therefore , while you may have strong opinions either way , you ca n't argue against the methodology . <p> Turns out downtown NYC has the best zip code in the country . The worst ? You might not be too surprised that a zip code in the middle of a Native American Reservation in Arizona takes the cake . <p> After analyzing more than 22,000 zip codes in America , we came up with this list as the 10 best zip codes in our nation : <p> 10282 " New York City <p> 94105 " San Francisco <p> 10005 " New York City <p> 02199 " Boston <p> 02110 " Boston <p> 22213 " Arlington , VA <p> 22201 " Arlington , VA <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VA <p> 10021 " New York City <p> So basically , downtown NYC , Boston , San Francisco or a Washington D.C. suburb are the best places to live .

It 's a strong argument that we 'll let you guys debate about in the comments below , but keep in mind Columbine is n't an actual city , either . <p> The residents of Stonegate earn more per household than any other family in the state . Home prices are really high , which means people want to live there very badly . And the crime is very low as well . <p> Stonegate is located just outside of Centennial. <h> 2 . Columbine 169997 @qwx369997 <p> Population : 24,178Crime : 7th lowest in ColoradoHousehold income : $81,184Average home value : $284,430School ranking : 32nd best in the state <p> Columbine is just about as close to a perfect area as you can get . Residents here are gainfully employed , and the schools are some of the best in the state . It 's safe , and residents get to enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downtown Columbine on its own is quite a gem , too . <h> 3 . Highlands Ranch <p> Highlands Ranch is by far the largest area to top this list . And , the population density is really high , meaning there 's a ton of things to do to keep you occupied . LIke the two places above , it 's also a census designated place , not an actual city . <p> Residents in this Denver suburb are very wealthy . No wonder the population has exploded nearly 40% in the last 15 years . Seems everyone wants a piece of Highlands Ranch . <h> 5 . Louisville <p> Little Louisville , a city just outside of Boulder , has it made . It has the second-lowest unemployment rate , and crime is far below average for Colorado . Residents here have great jobs , and the home price proves it 's a highly desirable location in the state , for those who can afford the high cost of living . <p> More good news : Louisville 's population has actually ticked down over the years . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Superior is right next door to Louisville . The only real glaring differences between the two : Superior residents are far wealthier , but the crime is much higher .

A 10% population growth is just about perfect for an area of this size . Crime is low , and the people who live in Ken Caryl are in the top ten in the state when it comes to personal income . <p> Additionally , the schools are in the top 10% when it comes to financial support . <h> 9 . Parker <p> If you want to love the Denver area , you ca n't go wrong if you decide to make the Town of Parker your home . However , everyone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled in the last 15 years , and is showing no signs up letting up . <p> Can you blame them ? It 's a beautiful place with really low crime , where a majority of residents are wealthy . Plus , the residents are really involved with helping to make Parker as great as possible . You cant get it much better than in Parker . <h> 10 . Eagle <p> The tiny town of Eagle may not remain tiny forever . The word has been out for a long , long time about how special this place is . In fact , the population of 6,000 is double from what it was just 15 years ago . <p> The residents are heavily involved in making their community even more awesome , and as many Coloradoans know , Eagle is a great central spot for excursions that make Colorado one of the best states in the nation for outdoor sports . <p> There You Have It <p> On paper , it seems as if living outside of Denver is the best choice you can make , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzing places in Colorado with the best economic situations , where there 's low crime and there 's a lot to do , this is an accurate list . <h> Facebook Discussion <h> 7 thoughts on " These Are The 10 Best Places To Live In Colorado " <p> Maybe you should add one more metric to your criteria Ask people in Stonegate ( or Columbine , or Highlands Ranch , or ) would they rather live in Vail ( or one of OUR awesome suburbs ) , or where they currently live . <p> This is n't science . This is data mining and running an algorithm . And congrats , your top 10 , it is basically a list of places native Coloradans hate . You found the highest concentration of Chilis and malls . Maybe out east that 's your idea of a good time , but not here . As a Denver native , there is nothing I love more than open space , not the horrid burbs of Highlands Ranch . <p> I 'm not from Colorado , but were thinking of moving . This list and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no help at all . Darren , I agree completely with your opening statement this is NOT science . This is using a personal opinion to analyze data . Its biased , and its absolutely not science . The data itself is scientific , but the analysis is pure opinion , there is no objectivity at all . <p> Almost no one likes a high crime rate and almost everyone wants good schools , sure , but high housing prices and high population density ? Who actually likes that ? I want to move to Colorado for its landscape , not to cram myself into another city . I can do that here in Atlanta . <p> I agree . And how do consensus areas even count ? Plus you must be wealthy to live in any of them . I grew up in Boulder and all the people who have moved in over the last decade or two have ruined it and the Front Range .

This left us with a total of 69 cities in North Carolina to rank . <p> Finally , we made 2013 factor more heavily than 2012 , since more recent crimes are a bigger determining factor in how dangerous a place is . You can see our overall ranking at the bottom of the post . <p> In the end , we get a result based on the number of crimes per city , divided by the number of residents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report was available , there were a total of 175,367 crimes committed in the state of North Carolina , of which only 9% were considered violent crimes . That means 1 in 56 people in the state was the victim of some type of crime . <p> The safest city , based on population , is Pinehurst . The most dangerous ? Lumberton , where residents had a 1 in 7 chance of being the victim of a property crime . <p> We must note that this report is not an analysis of the effectiveness of local police departments , nor does it reflect the fact that people from out of town may come into a community and cause a crime . It simply looks at where crimes occurred most frequently , based on a city 's population . <h> 1 .

Morrisville <p> For a population of just over 21,000 , the town of Morrisville saw only 12 total violent crimes in the last reporting year .
