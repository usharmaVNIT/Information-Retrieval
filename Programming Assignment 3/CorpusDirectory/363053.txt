What you wear is a reflection of yourself ; your interests , your personality . Fashion can be an art form , taking elements from other types of art , like architecture or industrial design , and incorporating it into the creation of clothing and accessories .

The- highly influential Dutch-born artist is famous for his stunning oil paintings of fields , flowers , self-portraits , oh , and cutting off his own ear .

His original works are found scattered in various galleries and collections around the world , but in the coming months , you 'll find many of them at the National Gallery of Victoria ( NGV ) . The works are presented in an exhibition called Van Gogh And The Seasons , which has been curated by art historian Sjraar van Heugten . <p> The exhibition is made possible thanks to a few key sponsors , including audio brands Dynaudio and Astell&amp;Kern , distributed in Australia and NZ by BusiSoft .

Use a trimmer to fade it out and steer clear of harsh lines . Next , make your face shape do the talking . Beards with a little more junk in the trunk tend to suit a round or square face . A fuller bottom half means your beard will elongate your face . So , those with a longer face shape will want to avoid this and instead opt for hair on the sides of the face .

The 34UC88 comes precisely at 34-inches diagonally , noticeably curved and ultra-wide . It 's hefty , too , as I found out when I was first setting it up .

It comes with a few genre-specific display modes which are designed to maximise the gaming experience and the curve will surely draw you in . However , as someone who does a fair bit of editing , I immensely enjoyed the sharpness and vibrancy of the display . There was no glare issue nor any- inaccurate colour display of pictures or videos . <p> What I had noticed from the display is that backlight bleeding ( a common problem encountered when the LCD screen fails to completely block the light coming from the source at the back of the monitor ) while inevitable , was not a problem at all . There was only a little bit of bleeding in the lower corners . However , since the screen is so wide , it is only on the peripheral as you will be paying attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the monitor performed extremely well .

If you are looking to upgrade your monitor at the office or for your games , and money is not a problem , you definitely want to consider the LG 34UC88.

LED lights get damaged and lose their lustre when exposed to heat but this is n't the case here . Jake Dyson designed a- cooling system by running a copper pipe along the arm and storing a- single drop of water inside the pipe . When the LEDs get hot from usage , the drop of water evaporates and travels to the other side of the tube , carrying the heat away with it . The result is that the LEDs do n't  deteriorate from prolonged heat exposure .

Everything was perfect , the way we wanted it to be except one little thing , deliveries ! <h> The Problem <p> Each day we get a constant stream of deliveries from couriers and although we love parcels , we do n't  like the interruptions so much . It 's a hassle having to stop whatever we 're doing to run to the intercom , answer the call and sometimes go down the stairs to let in a courier . Sometimes we would all be out to lunch and miss the deliveries altogether . <p> To try and reduce this issue we scoured the internet for different possible solutions .

The front of the doorbell features a large button and a wide angled HD video camera . There are also two speakers , a- microphone and a- motion detector built in . <p> There are two ways to power the doorbell ; battery or hard wiring . You can mount it on the wall and let it run on a built-in lithium polymer rechargeable battery .

Alternatively , if you have existing doorbell wiring you can hardwire the device to the power circuit . <p> The Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to operate the doorbell .

This is super thoughtful ; without the drill bit , it would be like getting a new toy that runs on batteries , only to find that they werent included and all the shops are shut . <p> The Ring activates in two scenarios , the first is when someone presses the doorbell , the second is when the heat-based motion sensor is activated when someone is in close proximity to the door . When the detector is triggered , the camera starts recording and also streams directly to the phone . <p> Ring Video Doorbell is compatible with a number of smart-lock systems such as Kevo , Kisi , LockState and Lockitron .

The types include porters , pale ales , stouts , dark ales , and a pilsner thrown in for good measure too .

Being the worlds first 35mm half-frame SLR and with such a compact size and light weight , it was a bit of a game changer back in the day . Fast forward just over 50 years and the PEN-F is back , and just as exciting and impressive as the original . <h> Olympus PEN-F <p> The new , digital PEN-F takes a few design notes from the original , sporting a stunning body that 's hard to fault in terms of looks . The camera is constructed from machined aluminium with magnesium components and a black leather-look wrap around it . Its available in either all black or silver and black . While in our past reviews of Olympus OM-D cameras , we 've mentioned how they all sport quite a retro aesthetic , the PEN-F really takes it up a notch especially the silver and black version . Everything from the fonts- to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgic look . <p> The PEN-F is a great camera for day-to-day use and would be ideal for street photographers . It weighs just under 430 grams without a lens attached . I 've found that its perfectly matched to the Olympus M.Zuiko 17mm F2.8 lens ; together they 're balanced and easy to carry every day . It does tend to get a bit front-heavy with larger zoom lenses , though if you 're using it primarily for street photography you wont necessarily- have to worry about that . The PEN-F feels nice to hold in your hand , and- although- it does n't  have a grip on the front , we did n't  find that to be much of a problem . You can also attach an external one if needed . <p> Like the OM-D E-M5 Mark II , the PEN-F features a fully articulating LCD screen . This is super handy to have , especially if you 're taking shots higher or lower than your eye level since you can angle the screen to still frame- the shot perfectly . Being able to flip it out and have it forward-facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - there 's nothing worse than watching your video back and realising only half your face was in frame . <h> Sensor <p> Though the PEN-F is part of Olympus Pen range , it bears a lot of similarities to the OM-D cameras , especially the E-M5 Mark II . Like the OM-D cameras , the PEN-F features a Micro Four Thirds sensor , however its an impressive 20 megapixels compared to the E-M5s 16 megapixels . Until the E-M1 Mark II came along , this was actually the highest resolution of all of Olympus mirrorless cameras . <p> The PEN-F also features the really cool high-res mode that some of the other cameras have . This is where the sensor shifts slightly , taking a total of eight shots of the same scene , and stitching them together to create a higher res image . The results are beautiful , but the only caveats are that your subject must be totally still and its best taken with a tripod . Otherwise , you 'll be left with blurry shots .

It features the same 5-axis stabilisation that the OM-D- Mark II line up has , which accounts for natural shaking and movements . This results in super crisp shots , even when taking them really quickly . The stabilisation is also a great feature when it comes to vlogging . We 've all seen the shaky , hand-held videos people take of themselves . Video footage from the PEN-F is always smooth thanks to the stellar stabilisation . This is a huge advantage of having a stabilisation system in the camera body itself , instead of just relying on the lens .

@@58608431 @7608431/ <h> Driving The 2017 McLaren 540C <p> May 24 , 2017 <p> Every so often at Hey Gents , we have the opportunity to take home a- very exciting car for a weekend . More often than not , its a struggle to bring ourselves to hand the keys back on Monday . The latest instance of this happening was with a 2017 McLaren 540C . It was , as you 'd expect , an incredible experience , and the thought of going back to driving around in our non-supercars was disappointing . But as the saying goes , its better to have driven a McLaren for a weekend and then given it back , than to never have driven a McLaren at all or something like that . <h> 2017 McLaren 540C <p> The 540C is McLarens " entry-level " model in its Sport Series . It sits under the 570S and 570GT in the range . While these two have more power and a few more luxuries , it certainly does n't  diminish how beautiful the 540C is to both look at- and drive . <p> Our test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a head turner if we ever saw one . And turn heads it did ; nearly everywhere we travelled , we noticed people staring , mouthing " McLaren " when they figured out what it was . It looks incredibly sleek and sporty , sitting tremendously low to the ground . While we were driving the car , there were at least three incidents of being stopped at a traffic light and looking up into the rear-view mirror to see people in cars behind us taking photos . So to say the 540C looks impressive is a huge understatement . <p> The cars butterfly doors added to the allure , although- it did take some time to get used to them . Needless to say , we- were more than happy to put in the effort . It also took a while to be able to gracefully enter and exit the car , given that its so- low to the ground . But again , if we had to be the ones to drive the car for a while and figure this out , then so be it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-performance- with everyday usability for the driver . So in other words , its- not meant to be relegated to special weekend drives ; you can take it on your daily commute too . With that in mind , McLaren- has crafted a comfortable cabin with well-laid out controls . A seven-inch IRIS touchscreen floats in the centre console , offering controls for the infotainment system and air-conditioning too . <p> There are only two seats in the car , so your mates will have to take turns when you take it out . Storage is found at the front of the car , and while you would n't be able to fit a bunch of suitcases , you could comfortably transport- a couple of backpacks or grocery bags . That is if you 're willing to brave it in- shopping centre car parks . We would n't blame you for wanting to drive this car everywhere though- even if it is just up to the shops . <h> The Drive <p> The voracious roar that the- car emits when you put your foot down on the accelerator is enough to send a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Although McLaren says the 540C is the entry-level model , it still packs a massive- punch . Its 3.8L V8 Twin Turbo engine delivers 397kw of power at 7,500RPM and 540Nm of torque . These specs are only marginally different to that of the 570S , and in day-to-day driving , you probably would n't notice much- difference . The 540C is quick off the mark , racing- from 0 to 100km/h in 3.5 seconds . The cars breakneck speed is also aided by its lightweight carbon fibre chassis ; a component that 's common to all McLaren vehicles . The MonoCell II chassis weighs less than 80kg and delivers exceptional dynamics to the drive . <p> While driving the 540C around the city was nice ( driving it anywhere , really , was nice ) , it came into its own- when we had- a bit of space . We took it down to the Royal National Park , where it moved in and out of corners like it was built for that job alone .

This- offers- varying levels of control over how the car performs. - Drivers also get further control of the car- thanks to paddle shifters allowing you to change gears manually if preferred .

@@58608443 @7608443/ <h> Life Goals iPad Pro &amp; Simply Piano <p> May 16 , 2017 <p> Ever since I was a kid- I always wanted to learn the piano . Whenever I saw people playing the instrument I always thought that they looked so smart- as they effortlessly played the notes from a sheet of music . I wish I had the opportunity to learn it when I was young , but my family did n't have the spare cash for a piano , let alone those hefty- tuition fees. - I 'd like to think I would be pretty good at it by now if I started back then . Having said that , I wonder if I would have had the discipline . <p> As I got older I bought myself an electronic piano and decided to try and learn how to play on my own using tutorial books . Unfortunately , this did n't  work out well . I could n't really comprehend what the book was saying and I found that the music examples did n't really translate well in print . It was also really boring . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly busy with work commitments . I was about to give up on it- until two magical things appeared in my life : an iPad Proand the- Simply Piano- app . <p> iPads are great for watching movies and browsing the web in front of a- TV but I have n't used it for much else . Then along came the iPad Pro , its like a totally different product altogether . With the attachable keyboard and pencil , it became much more of a creative machine . But that 's another story , what was really cool was that while browsing the App Store for new apps that I could use with the Apple Pencil , I came across Simply Piano . Simply Piano teaches you how to sight read and play the piano by displaying sheet music on the screen in a series of entertaining lessons . There are a wide variety of courses for different playing levels and it is suitable for all ages. - The app had good reviews and the basic version was free , so I decided to give it a go . <p> I initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and after only a few minutes I knew it was going to be awesome . I upgraded my membership to get the full suite of lessons and exercises , its really cheap compared to getting a music tutor . <p> Being super busy at work I decided that I 'd only commit to 20 minutes of practice 3 times a week . All other days I would just do the 5-minute daily workout on the app. - This might not sound like much practice time but I have gone from no piano skills to now being able to sight read sheet music ( albeit slowly ) and play two-octave scales- within a year . I can also play several different chords and understand fundamental finger techniques . <p> Although you can use the app across other iOS- and Android- devices , I found that using Simply Piano on the- iPad Pro gave the best experience . The iPad Pro has a fast processor that renders the animations and music smoothly and the large retina screen made it comfortable for watching and following the tutorials . Having the four powerful speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backing tracks when I was playing along with them . This is not the case with an iPhone , iPad mini or other android devices as the speakers are just not loud enough and can distort on max volume , making the lessons much less enjoyable . <p> One of the standout features of Simply Piano compared to other piano tutoring apps is the listening feature that analyses what you 're playing and gives you feedback on how well you 're going. - The microphone on the iPad Pro picks up the notes from the piano quite well , however , I noticed that the app sometimes has trouble recognising four-note chords . <p> Simply Piano is probably not a complete replacement for a qualified piano teacher , but it definitely helps if you want to get started . If you are looking to learn the piano or brush up on your skills , the app will save you a bunch of money . Now that I have some basic skills , my next step is to find a music tutor to visit once a month just to get some human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simply Piano . Stay tuned for an update next year . 
@@58608444 @7608444/ <p> As far as carrying on family legacies goes , we reckon that Ernest Shackletons great-grandson has done a pretty good job of it . Shackleton is , of course , world-renowned for his Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century . About 100 years ago , he and his team attempted to cross the continent , sea to sea , via the South Pole . Unfortunately , they ultimately failed , thanks to their ship becoming stuck in pack ice , and they all had to be rescued . Enter his great-grandson , Patrick Bergel , who late last year successfully completed the journey that his ancestor and crew set out to achieve a century earlier . In 30 days , Bergel crossed the continent by car , in a 2.2L diesel Hyundai Santa Fe with limited modifications . <p> Considering cars generally are n't  made to be driven across entire continents and ice caps in temperatures that get down to -28 degrees celsius , - Bergel was n't the only one being challenged during the journey. - The Hyundai Santa Fe was carefully prepared by Gisli J+nsson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A testament to the quality of the car and the expertise of all involved in ensuring its road worthiness ( or ice worthiness ) , Bergel and- the vehicle made it back safely and successfully . <p> The impressive feat was captured on video , which showcases the ups and downs faced by all involved as they battled some decidedly intense conditions , followed by some rather beautiful moments . Things like driving past Mount Erebus , a mountain first climbed by Shackleton , were especially poignant . The video hits an emotional crescendo when Bergel finally reaches McMurdo Sound , Shackletons intended final destination . Its some pretty profound footage , and serves as a very inspiring story that ends with Bergel suggesting that his great-grandfathers expedition did n't  actually fail , " it just took a hundred years to complete .

@@58608455 @7608455/ <h> Interview : Montauk Style The Virtues Of Premium Linen Bedding <p> June 30 , 2017 <p> Travelling frequently for work and staying in dozens- of different hotel rooms would make you a pretty quick expert in all things bedding . You start to learn pretty quickly how firm you like a mattress , how fluffy is too fluffy when it comes to pillows , and what kind of sheets feel the nicest . This is how Martyn Feller learned that pure linen is a superior fabric when it comes to bedding . Soft , light , and smooth , its a material of many virtues . In order to spread the good word- about pure linen , Martyn set about launching Montauk Style . <p> Montauk Style offers a wide range of pure , premium linen bedding , crafted from French flax. - The pieces are available in different subdued and neutral shades , easy to style with each other and the rest of your bedroom . Their most recent release is Darkest Hour ; limited edition quilt cover and sheets in pure , deep black . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darkest Hour range , and what 's next for Montauk Style <p> What sets linen apart from other fabrics when it comes to bedding ? - <p> When anyone asks what linen sheets are like , I tell them it 's the business class ' of bedding . Once you 've tried it , it 's hard to go back ! Linen is known to be the world 's strongest natural fibre and is 2-3 times stronger than cotton . The fabric is cool to touch , smooth on the skin and becomes softer the more you wash and roll around in the sheets . It 's a thick yet lightweight fabric without being stuffy like some heavy thread count cotton sheets . Its long fibres have the highest heat conductivity of any fabric , keeping your body cool in summer and warm in winter . Linen has a tendency to wrinkle , but this is part of linen 's charm , creating a laid-back lived-in look and feel . Linen 's natural drape and relaxed texture make styling effortless and reflect the uncomplicated beauty of the fabric . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years ago I took a punt and dropped 15K on an order of pure linen quilt covers . It was risky and I paid through the nose for those quilt covers , but that was the MOQ ( minimum order quantity ) required for a linen factory to even look in my direction. - I began selling online , part motivated to recoup my investment , the other part to reclaim my apartment and clear the half tonne of linen crammed in my living room . I started receiving enquiries from satisfied customers about when sheets would be available to match their quilt covers , which was validation as well as the confirmation needed to extend the range to all sheet types as well as work on developing a colour palette . Montauk now occupies warehouse space in Sydney 's inner west , where we have set up an adjoining office and showroom , where customers and potential stockists can stop by , see and feel the linen . We encourage visitors to bring their jammies and roll around in our sheets . We see deliveries of over 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase as we extend our range . <p> What has been the biggest challenge since launching the brand ? - <p> The biggest challenge is an ongoing one which is to keep striving to improve the product in regards to aesthetics , design , comfort , and quality . These components carry equal weight and must each be considered as parts and whole when planning and locking down decisions in the pre-production phase . In this business you have to become a stickler for details and every production must see an evolution of the product . The modifications and tweaks are the results of research , constant testing , awareness of industry direction , listening to every word our customers say and lastly , trusting and applying your intuition . <p> Tell us about the limited edition Darkest Hour set you 've just released , and what kind of room you had in mind when creating it. - <p> We were looking to add something rich and dark to our palette . It had to exude decadence and sophistication as well as create depth and dimension in our collection . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular apartment I visited stood out in memory . The converted warehouse loft was one massive space of floor-to-ceiling white , featuring all white furniture , floorboards , and an enormous shag pile rug . Juxtaposed at the far end of the room was an enormous bed draped in layers of the darkest deepest black linen , blankets , and cushions . Darkest Hour was the culmination and appeals to those looking for a mature and sophisticated update to their bedroom . An all black affair in the bedroom was what we had in mind with Darkest Hour , but something we did n't  expect was how well it played with the other colours from the collection , most notably storm grey , almond , and cactus . Through normal wash and wear , Darkest Hour will tone down a notch to become a gritty industrial coal which we are equally excited about . <p> What 's on your bed at home at the moment ? - <p> The range has been configured adhering to the fundamentals of simplicity , minimalism , and sophistication . Whether it 's automobiles , film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to seasonal fads and the threads on my bed are no exception . At the moment I 'm combining the soft muted tones of Manhattan Grey and Glacier . The slight variation of hues couple beautifully together and brightens the room especially throughout the winter months . A stark Milkcloud White Flat Sheet in between gives separation and highlights the subtleness of pastels . On rotation with Manhattan Grey is a Vintage Denim Blue Quilt Cover . The concept here was to find a gentle matte blue designed to fade over time to the same shade as your oldest and most favourite pair of jeans . <p> What 's next for Montauk Style ? <p> Montauk Style is about bringing the effortless comfort and charm of a Hampton 's beach house into your home . Whilst the core of Montauk Style remains pure linen bedding , we 've recently added a range of lifestyle products that transcends the bedroom , including luscious pure linen blankets , cushions , amazingly soft stonewash-finished robes , sleepwear , and towels .

On the 29th June 1831 a man named Richard Phillips obtained a liquor licence for the Shipwright Arms on the north-east corner of Sydneys Kent and Argyle streets . The Shipwright Arms was to go through a number of owners and name changes- throughout the years- ( including a- minor- relocation across the road ) . In 1986 , now- current owner Blair Hayden- bought the pub and restored the ailing venue to- its- former colonial glory- think sandstone walls and old wooden tables . All this colonial appropriation got- Blair- thinking . Why did n't he , - like his publican predecessors , - brew his own beer ?

You do n't  always need to spend a fortune to have an enjoyable time away , but having enough money saved that you feel like you can splurge if you want to , is a good idea . Everyone on the Hey Gents team is a rather keen traveller , so we 've compiled a few tips and tricks that have helped us when it comes to the best ways to budget for a holiday . <h> Figure Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much money you think you 'll need . Things like airfares , accommodation , and travel insurance are easy to figure out , but delve a little deeper and research things like entry fees to museums and sights , transport within your destination , visa fees etc . The internet is , of course , a great resource for this , but its also handy to ask a family member or friend who 's recently been to your destination for ideas on things like the price of food , drinks , and souvenirs too . <h> BYO Lunch <p> Okay , so you 've worked out roughly how much money you 'll need , and now you have a goal to work towards . So how do we reach that ? In the time leading up to your holiday , you 'll need to tighten the belt a bit at home . This requires a bit of work and preparation on your part , but its entirely worth it in the end . If you 're anything like me , food is probably the biggest drain on your disposable income . Buying lunch out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance , so spend a bit of time each week planning out meals you can make at home and BYO lunch to work or uni . This works out all the better if you have someone to share grocery costs with , plus you 'll likely end up eating rather healthier too . Win-win ! <p> Coffee is another cost that can make a deceptively large impact on your savings . Sure , its only a couple of gold coins every day , but those gold coins add up to big numbers each week big numbers that could go towards a beach villa on Santorini instead . If you do have a caffeine habit that you 're not willing to break ( I understand ) , look into picking up a plunger or pour over kit that you can keep in the office . Itll work out cheaper in the long-term . <h> Stop Shopping <p> Do you- really- need a brand new wardrobe right before you jet off ? Especially considering a new pair of boardies probably wo n't get much use when you 're skiing in the Alps . You can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while if that means you can afford to stay in a private hotel room instead of a backpackers dorm while you 're overseas . I 've stayed in enough of the latter in the past to know that sometimes , splurging on a private room with its very own bathroom was worth not buying a new pair of leather sneakers before I went away . <h> Beg , Borrow , Or Steal <p> Okay , only one of those options is really viable . Hopefully , you 've saved enough on your own to cover the majority of costs for your holiday , but sometimes we all need a helping hand . This is where cash loans come in . Companies like Nimble offer flexible loans that can help when it comes to paying for unexpected costs you did n't  budget for ( hel-lo passport renewal fee ) . They 're also especially handy for airfares , which- can often be your biggest expense . Knowing that 's covered before you leave can be a big relief , and you can focus on saving the rest of your money for the holiday itself .

Having said that , if you do n't  really know how to approach a big purchase like this , it can be pretty daunting too . With that in mind , we 've compiled a few tips and tricks to help you through the experience of buying- a new car , from where to start to what to do once you 've found your dream car . <h> Where To Start ? <p> Knowing where to start can be the most difficult part of the process . If you do n't  have anything particular in mind , think about your family and friends and what kind of cars they have . Do any of them appeal to you ? Another good starting point is thinking about- what you like the look of when you see a car on the road . Check- out the manufacturer and model and go from there . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youve- spotted , but where do you go when the car that caught your eye is a bit beyond your budget ? Do some research on what other vehicles that- company- makes and figure out their different classes and models as well . Its likely that theyll have something in their- range more- suited to you . <h> Check Out The Competition <p> Youve decided what you want , but as it turns out , there 's a direct competitor to your car of choice , and its $3,000 cheaper ! Motoring.com.au is a great resource to have on hand when you need to figure out which one is better for you . Their team of vehicle experts conducts extensive comparisons between similar cars to determine exactly what the differences and similarities are , which makes it way easier for you to figure out which one to spend your money on . <h> Read Reviews <p> Once you 've slimmed your options down to a few , it time to read a few in-depth reviews to get an expert opinion on each vehicle . Its important to read a number of reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , Motoring.com.au is a great place to do this . Checking out thorough reviews by people who know what they 're talking about- is a great way to really get to know a car before you 've even gone to the dealership for a test drive . Furthermore , itll arm you with heaps of information that will help when you start talking to sales people . Knowledge is power , which is no exception when it comes to buying a new car ! <h> Go For A Test Drive <p> Your dream car may be perfect on paper , but when you actually get behind the wheel it can be a totally different story . Avoid disappointment after you 've already made the purchase- by taking it for a test drive beforehand . Its a good idea to give it a go in a few different road conditions . This helps you figure out how you can expect your car to handle in both your regular driving conditions as well as at other times too. - Its also important to ensure the car you 're testing has the same specifications as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprises later on . <h> Sort Out Your Finances &amp; Shop Around <p> Once you 've done all your research and decided on a car , go to a few different dealerships to see who can offer- you the best price . Chances are they wo n't all be wildly varied , but if you can shave off a bit from the final price or have a few extras thrown in , it always helps . Furthermore , customer service can affect your decision too . A car is no small purchase , so if one salesperson is n't treating you well , go- somewhere else . <p> Having your finances sorted out beforehand is also a good way of ensuring you stick to your budget , and it can help when it comes to negotiating with the salesperson . Theyll know that you 're prepared to purchase if the price is right and they could be more willing to give you a better deal . Before you sign anything , make sure you 've checked and double-checked all the forms and papers you see , too .

The business is- Australian Certified Organic which is no easy feat given that you have to go through a not insignificant on-site ingredients and equipment audit . Moreover , they tracked down legendary Aussie brewer Bruce Peachey ( the brain behind some very well known Australian brands like Bluetongue Brewery and John Boston ) who helped them source the very best organic malts and hops available .

The English design and engineering giants brought their Dyson- CSYS Task Light- to Australia this year , and were left wondering how we ever worked without one . You may think your current desk lamp works fine , but the Dyson CSYS is entirely functional and exceptionally bright. - Best of all , the CSYS Task Light has a super- minimal aesthetic that would look ideal with any kind of desk set up . <p> The Dyson CSYS emits a warm white light from eight high power LEDs . It has a really- powerful light output because the LEDs are positioned only 8mm apart. - The beauty of the product stems partly from the fact that the light actually stays where you want it . Everyone has had the experience of positioning a desk lamp exactly at the right level and angle , only to have it sag and move the light elsewhere . Dyson recognised this common problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traditional lamps use springs and pivots to stay upright , which are prone to weakening over time . - The CSYS Task Light utilises a counterweight pulley system using gravity to stay in position . <p> - With the simple touch of a fingertip , the light- moves smoothly- horizontally , spun- around 360 degrees or- up and down the stem . This allows you to get the perfect level of illumination exactly where you want it , and you do n't  have to worry about it moving anywhere . When you move the light down the stem , illumination is concentrated in a specific spot . This is ideal if you 're doing something really detailed and need light focused in a particular area . As you move it up , the light- spreads out evenly across the surface area its focused on. - Furthermore , a touch sensitive , continuous dimmer gives you the ability to adjust the brightness to any level you prefer . <p> Of course , a Dyson product would n't be complete without at least a few different innovations . The CSYS Task Light uses Heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This kind of technology is typically found in satellites and microprocessors . Its an important feature because when LEDs are exposed to heat , their brightness and colour diminish over time . The use of Heat Pipe Technology means the lights in the CSYS sustain their brightness for an impressive 144,000 hours . <p> On top of all that , the Dyson CSYS Task Light is an incredibly sleek looking product . Its a subtle design and the minimal aesthetic would work with almost any kind of desk set up . If space is at a premium in your workspace , then you 'll appreciate the- small footprint of the lamp , which can easily fit on any work table .

@@58608473 @7608473/ <h> Three Reasons The Apple AirPods Are Worth It <p> February 16 , 2017 <p> We looked strange when we first started talking into a brick that did n't have a cable connected to it . We looked like loonies holding up a wire and speaking to it when microphones were introduced to earphones . Once again , we will all look a little nuts- talking into- Apple AirPods , - which look like earphones but with the wires cut off . If history is any indication , then we 'll all get used to the look of the- AirPods soon enough and then revel in their convenience and usefulness . In the meantime , here are three ways they can be extremely helpful- while giving nobody a reason to judge you for it . <h> When Cycling <p> It was only a few weeks ago that I was wearing my trusty sports wireless earphones ( which is a misnomer really , as they actually have a cable connecting the two earpieces ) while cycling . I stopped at a busy intersection and was getting ready to turn right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then right again . As I started the process and was about to push off while turning my head right for the final time , the cable behind my neck got caught and yanked the left earpiece out . In a situation that commands utmost care and attention , my judgement was compromised by this trivial movement . I needed earphones that would actually be wireless in every sense so that I would n't have this issue again . <p> Although I was initially reluctant about their design , I tried the new Apple AirPods shortly after for this very reason . As a cyclist , I noticed that my helmet helped draw the attention away from what was protruding out of my ears . Despite the small size , the glossy white body of the AirPods do stand out . Regardless , they were very comfortable and stayed firm in my ears . The important thing was that I could turn my head in any direction with ease . That , coupled with some obvious sound quality improvements over the wired version , makes the AirPods- an excellent companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch on a bike has always been good but not great . You could easily miss a haptic tap here and there with the bumps on the road . Using it in combination with the AirPods , though , will ensure that you always get to your destination without missing a turn . <h> The Airport <p> You already have enough to worry about when you 're rushing through the airport , so the last thing you want is a tangled mess of wires dangling from your pant pocket . The AirPods are a great option instead of heavy headphones so that you can still hear what 's going on around you as you journey through airport obstacles . Plus , they 're lightweight and easy to remove when you need to. - If you happen to get a phone call while dragging all that luggage around , you can answer the call with a double-tap on one earpiece . When going through airport security , just take them off and stick them into your pocket . I 've tested this and the AirPods did not set off the body scanner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which went through the baggage scanner in my backpack . <p> The other thing about airports is that everyone is so preoccupied trying to get to their flight or thinking about the awesome destination that they 're heading to , they wo n't actually care about what other people are doing or wearing . Hardly anyone looked at me wearing the AirPods and if they did , they did n't  really pay any attention to it . <h> The Office <p> Initially , you might attract some looks and then some snickers , or as it happened in our office " a straight out crack-up from your- work mates . But soon enough theyll get it out of their system , while you get to enjoy the convenience of the AirPods . <p> Using earphones between Apple devices have never been this easy ; the AirPods work seamlessly between Apple products . In fact , once youve easily paired them with your iPhone , they stay paired every time you take them out of the case thanks to the embedded W1 chip . Once connected to your iPhone , they automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed into on iCloud . So if you need to watch a video on your laptop , you can simply connect it to your AirPods via the system menu . That means you no longer have to physically unplug your earphones from phone to laptop and vice versa . <p> Furthermore , the AirPods might be the most intuitive earphones ever . Music starts playing when you pop them in your ears , automatically pauses when you take one or both buds out , and then resumes when you put them back in . When you 're only wearing one , the music plays in mono and switches to stereo when both are worn . The bass on the AirPods is definitely better than its wired predecessor. - You can also use your AirPods to access Siri " just double tap and ask away , if that 's how you 've configured them . <p> So there you go , that 's three great reasons to get a pair of Apple AirPods and we know that soon enough , everyone will be sporting them around .

The initiative is designed to celebrate members of society we often see and walk past but do n't  often take the time to get to know . These are the street musicians and buskers who provide the background music to the city . Feeling The Streets aim is to uncover six of the best street musicians from around the world to form a- Global Street Band . This year saw 370 contenders enter the international talent quest , from who the public voted for and decided upon the winners . Combining their talents together , the six winners then formed a band and hit the road . Undertaking a road trip that took them through New South Wales , the band found themselves at the Blue Mountains , Hunter Valley , as well as local Indigenous sites and vineyards . All of this finally culminated in their biggest gig , on a super yacht at Sydney Harbour . <p> We were recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsed for a special , one-off show in Sydney . The night began at Potts Points The Powder Keg , followed by a short walk to a nearby hotel where the band was rehearsing with their mentor , Jason Kerrison , a musician and X-Factor New Zealand judge . <p> Ranging in age from 19 to 32 , the musicians possess an undeniable talent . With a chance to meet the band members during the intimate session , it was pretty incredible to hear the different stories of what brought each of them there . The bands vocalist , Chelei Solo , is 21 and had only been busking on the streets of India for one week before she entered Feeling The Street . 31-year-old drummer Albert Peres from Colombia , on the other hand , has been playing for 12 years . He s self-taught and used the internet and YouTube to learn his craft . <p> One of the stand out tracks from the night was the original song that the band had written together . They had only known each other a few days before crafting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@58608480 @7608480/ <h> Interview : Behind The Scenes Of gentSac <p> May 10 , 2017 <p> Changing male grooming habits of recent years has resulted in a proliferation of quality brands and products , as well as a whole lot of information , all targeted towards men . This is a great thing , however it can be pretty tough to figure out what 's right for you when it comes to your skin and hair . The Australian store , - gentSac- launched a year ago in response to this . The business is the brainchild of Shira- OSullivan-Linker and her husband , Ross OSullivan , who have set out to help the men of Australia navigate the often overwhelming world of grooming . <p> gentSac is celebrating the first birthday of its store in The Galeries in Sydney this month , - so we caught up with Shira to find out more- about the growing business . <p> How did the idea of gentSac come about ? <p> My partner and I noticed that I was always- curating grooming products and essentials for him whenever there was an- opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding something he could use that was different or more exciting to the ordinary purchase of everyday essentials at the supermarket . One day he made a comment that he really loved receiving these kits that I would make up and that he wanted to make a consistent effort in taking better care of himself . We realised that he- couldnt be the only guy that actually did care about looking and feeling good or establishing some kind of beard/shave/skin routine . We realised there were a lot of really cool brands that existed for men but nowhere in- Australia actually had a- full selection . The idea that we could bundle up essential products that were affordable but a little more luxe or lifestyle orientated and deliver them without the hassle of shopping felt like something Australian men would really appreciate . <p> The name was no pun intended ! I designed a Sac that we would curate the products into , so that the guys had something just for them that was nice to receive but also able to be used again . The name has definitely been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical store you opened last year . <p> The physical space evolved out of our initial strategy to pop up at curated and suitable markets . As a self-funded business with very little marketing budget , I felt we needed to have an opportunity to have a physical presence that could help us with brand awareness , whilst also testing the market and getting real-time customer feedback . <p> About three months in , we were discovered by a team member from The Galeries who had reached out to discuss the notion of creating a space within their centre . It felt like a move we would have made later on in the piece , however in this instance , the transition to a more permanent location was a great opportunity to further grow our presence . So we dived right in and within three months had designed and custom built the gentSac store . <p> A lot ! For one , men do care about grooming however , there is a lot of misinformation out there . Weve taken a lot of pride in receiving first-hand training from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products we sell is valuable and a part of the experience we offer . We also know that some men like to touch and smell product before purchasing , where a lot of guys do n't  particularly enjoy shopping and most are short of time , so having the subscription service that can be customised is a great option for those guys . <p> More importantly , we 've confirmed that the notion of a man taking the time to have a routine and the pride in himself is not far out of reach , its just not been huge in our culture in the 21st century and if it was , it was n't really talked about . Our mission is to make Mens Grooming not just a thing but the norm . We want Aussie gents to feel comfortable in their skin , confident and unapologetic for taking time for themselves to look after their skin and grooming . Its not just for the ladies its for humans who want to feel awesome . <p> What are some common grooming questions men come to you with ? <p> Anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beard , how to use a safety razor , through to understanding the hair products they need for the hair style they want . - This is why we 've launched Grooming consultations ! <p> What do you look for in a brand when curating products to stock ? <p> Initially , I look for a story and a purpose . I really want to know why this brand started and does the ethos of the brand align with our mission . I also look for the lifestyle aspect the packaging , the ingredients and most importantly does it do what its supposed to . I am also really passionate about helping Australia brands launch their product into the market as we have the opportunity to give them a platform whilst also providing hands-on feedback to help their brand grow . Ultimately we are about curating a collection of bespoke brands that offer a sense of affordable luxury . <p> Walk us through your regular day . How does it start ? How are you dividing your time ? <p> 3-4 days a week start with yoga. - I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most productive energy in the morning . I 'm usually either at the office by 7:30 or heading into a meeting with a team member , new brand etc and I like to do my store visits after midday where I 'm on the floor interacting with customers . My days are generally in the vicinity of 12-13 hours so when I go home I 'm all about down time with Rossco ( hubby ) and my dogs , dinner , chill and the occasional yoga at night ( or a massage for a treat ! ) . Unless there is a crazy deadline I 'm generally asleep by 9:30 ! <p> What 's been your biggest challenge since starting the business ? <p> Creating internal processes that support the counter-intuitive nature of a start-up . We are constantly learning and evolving so our processes should be agile enough to change seamlessly with our transition periods . <p> Youve partnered with beyondblue in the past to create a special edition kit ; are there more gentSac collaborations in the pipeline ? <p> Absolutely , we are passionate about our obligation to social causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allow us to give back to the community . <p> What 's next for gentSac ? <p> The release of our new service One on One Grooming consultations . Weve created an experience both in-store and online/over the phone that can ensure guys get the attention they need when it comes to selecting new products or dealing with specific grooming concerns . The Grooming consultation also allows them to sample the products they would like to try or assist them in selecting the right products for their customised subscription whilst also providing great value . <p> Were excited to announce that Shira will be contributing a series of guest articles on mens grooming on Hey Gents .

Since the Quantum dots emit their own light , the screen is able to deliver richer contrast and greater detail , regardless of how bright or dark the scene is .

@@58608483 @7608483/ <h> Samsung Galaxy S8+ The New Frontier of Smartphone Design <p> April 19 , 2017 <p> After a long series of leaks , speculation and unconfirmed release dates , Samsung has finally released its brand new flagship , the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ . It was definitely worth the wait . Both the S8 and S8+ are pretty much identical apart from its screen size and battery . This is what we like to see , as you shouldnt be penalised with fewer features just because you prefer to carry a smaller phone . Having said that , we could n't go past the jaw-dropping screen of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ , and that is what we managed to get our hands on to try out . <h> Design <p> At first glance , the Galaxy S8+ has a somewhat familiar look to past Samsung smartphones , but once you are up close and personal with the phone , the newly redesigned handset will blow you away . It is a beautiful device , with every corner and edge of the S8 now being rounded. - The S8+ features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) display that is packed tightly into the frame of the phone . This means that the phone is mostly just screen , with the lowest bezel-to-screen ratio we 've seen on a smartphone . The removal of the outer glass framing on the front of the phone has resulted in the S8 having a very striking , futuristic look that is completely unique . <p> One of the major changes in this version of the Galaxy is the removal of the home screen mechanical button and fingerprint scanner . These have been separated ; the home button is now embedded under the screen and a new fingerprint scanner can be found at the back of the phone next to the camera . This probably was n't the best place to put the fingerprint scanner as we found that from a tactile perspective , it could often be confused with the camera lens . This really is n't a huge issue though as we preferred using the other options to unlock the phone , namely the iris scanner and facial recognition . The iris scanning is much improved in comparison to the S7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its hard to fault the design of the Samsung S8/S8+ . The glass front and back gives the phone- a- beautiful sleek finish like no other . But if we had to pick a flaw , it would have to be that ( like all glass objects ) it does become a bit of a fingerprint collector. - <h> Features <p> Along with the announcement of the new phone , Samsung also introduced Bixby the highly touted new intelligent personal assistant that is included with the S8 and S8+ . Bixby is an AI system that was designed by Samsung to make interaction easier with the increasing complexity of everyday devices . Bixby is currently limited to 10 Samsung first-party apps . Once it is fully integrated it will work across a range of Samsung products . <p> An interesting accessory of the S8 is the Samsung Dex , which turns this Android phone into a true desktop-class environment . Using Dex is effortless , just plug the phone into the Dex dock that is also connected to a monitor , keyboard and mouse , and then you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit documents through Google 's productivity apps or Microsoft Office , or connect to a remote desktop using Citrix or Amazon WorkPlaces . Samsung Dex helps to harness the full capabilities of this powerful phone and leaves the door open for Samsung to upgrade on the idea of turning their phones into laptop-like devices in the future . <p> Every S8 and S8+ will also come bundled with AKG headphones that are lightweight and feature powerful sound . <h> Usability <p> When Samsung first introduced curved screen edges , they were pretty , but also pretty annoying . The original design of the S6 Edge , whilst innovative , did not factor in accidental finger contact on the edge of the screen from simply gripping the phone . This lead to the inadvertent triggering of functions and item selections- as a result . Whilst we never tried the S7 Edge , we also heard reports of this happening . However , we are happy to say that the dual curved edges of the S8/S8+ have not been prone- to this issue. - <p> Not as courageous as Apple , Samsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship . Alongside the headphone jack , you 'll also find a brand new USB Type-C port for charging , microphone and speaker . On the top of the phone , you 'll find the usual unified SIM tray that holds a nanoSIM and microSD card . The phone itself has 64GB of inbuilt storage which might be enough for some users but for those who need more , it can be expandable to 2TB through the microSD slot . <p> The S8- comes with an IP68 rating , so you wo n't have to worry about dust nor water getting in in fact you can pretty much take it swimming with you . Hooray for the party pool shots . <h> Camera Performance <p> The back camera is the same as the one in the Samsung S7 , but the new multi-frame image feature is excellent . Three snaps are shot and the sharpest one of the three is selected whilst using the other two to reduce motion blur . So despite having the same camera , the software improvement allows the S8 to take better photos in low light. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear , sharp and features a great low-light sensor . <p> The below images were taken with the Galaxy 8+ . All three shots were unedited , with the third one taken in low light. - <h> The Wrap-Up <p> Featuring the most incredible screen ever to be built on a phone , and if Android is your thing , then this is definitely the best phone you can get right now well in a few days time . Australia will initially get the Midnight Black , Orchid Grey and Maple Gold versions of both the phones on the launch date of April 28th.

Either way , its a good idea to stay in the know with the latest advice and products when it comes to taming your whiskers . In partnership with MR PORTER , we 've created a simple guide on how to get the most from your shave <h> 1 . Have The Right Tools <p> The last thing you want to do to your face is slice it up with a bad razor . This is not one of the areas of your grooming routine that you can get away with skimping on quality . There are a few routes you can go with the razor ; electric , straight-edge , safety , or cartridge . You 're likely most familiar with the electric and cartridge , or disposable , options . They both offer the easiest learning curves , however the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straight-edge razors . You 'll get the closest shave from the latter two , but you 'll first have to take the time to master the art of using them . When you do get the hang of them , it is entirely worth it in the end ; in terms of both overall cost over the years and shave quality . Were partial to a safety razor ourselves , with the D R Harris- as our go-to. <h> 2 . Prepare Your Skin <p> Its a good idea to shave right after you hop out of the shower , as the heat will help soften your whiskers , which makes them a hell of a lot more pleasant to shave off . Regardless of the type of razor you use , pairing it with a good shaving cream is a must . Shaving cream moisturises , protects , and lubricates your skin , allowing the razor to move across it way easier . This helps prevent razor burn too , which is caused when the razor drags and tears the skin . <h> 3 . Treat Your Skin Afterwards <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn your skin . There are some much nicer options available nowadays . The purpose of aftershave is to protect your skin from bacteria entering your pores and therefore causing problems like acne or infections . We 'd recommend using one to keep your skin looking its best . Stay away from alcohol if you see it as the main ingredient in an aftershave ; not only does it sting , but itll dry out your skin quickly too . Witch hazel is a good , natural alternative . The D R Harris Arlington Aftershave Milk is a favourite of ours ; it contains a mild , non-stinging antiseptic plus it keeps your skin moisturised. <h> 4 . Do n't  Neglect The Beard <p> You 're not off the hook if you 're not the clean-shaven type . If you have a beard , or are attempting to grow one , there 's still maintenance required to ensure it looks and feels clean . Trim it when there are strays so it looks neat , and wash it regularly . Conditioning in the form of a dedicated beard oil is an important step too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is part and parcel of growing a beard . If you 've already cultivated your ideal facial hair , the regular use of beard oil helps keep it smooth , nourished , and makes it easier to style .

With the new and improved pixel technology , the OLED TVs are able to deliver incredible contrast and detail in a wide viewing angle . Through the elimination of a backlight , each pixel has the ability to turn on and off individually , hence achieving a perfect black and rich , vivid contrast . That also means no excess light , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series is available in 4 different models at various screen sizes. - With the exception of the W7 , every model in the series has a built-in sound bar attached underneath the display . At only 40 watts the native sound component is good enough for smaller environments . However , if you have a mid-sized room or just want greater sound , LG has a new series of external sound bars available that are sold separately . <p> For a more- cinema-like experience at home , the new OLED range features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos technologies . Dolby Vision enhances picture quality and realism by dynamically adjusting the contrast in a scene-by-scene basis . Dolby Atmos brings forth multi-dimensional audio by locating separate sound elements to different channels to map out a true-to-life soundscape . Both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are relatively new technologies that are rapidly adopted by filmmakers and contents creators .

Together , they measure at just 4mm in thickness , with the display at 2.57mm by itself . To achieve this feat , all its processing and power components are transferred to an SJ9 sound bar connected through a ribbon cable . <p> The SJ9 sound bar has a slim design that can be mounted to the wall , underneath the W7 . At a whopping 500 watts , the SJ9 is capable of delivering powerful , cinematic surround sound with rich detail . <p> The W7 comes in one size only , at 65 inches .

By utilising a new technology called Nano Cell , the Super UHD 4K TV offers more accurate colour display as well as wide viewing angles . The technology employs a film of nano-sized particles to achieve precision in image reproduction . These particles are also light-absorbent so they absorb excess light waves , resulting in clearer and purer colour display . <p> In collaboration with leading audio specialist Harman Kardon , the Super UHD series boasts clear , refined sound at 80 watts . For more powerful and immersive sound , you can make an additional purchase of a sound bar from LGs SJ series ( discussed below ) . <p> There are 3 models in the series : SJ95 , SJ85 and UJ75 .

The world famous Italian motorcycle company , Moto Guzzi has celebrated its 95th anniversary by introducing two neo-classic cruisers to the market , the V9 Roamer and the V9 Bobber . <p> The Roamer is the more elegant and classic looking of the two , with a narrow 100/90-19 front tyre , comfortable riding position and finished off with gloss paint and chrome mechanical details . The steering is light , allowing it to tip in to corners a lot quicker , making it an ease to ride and manoeuvre . It comes in Solar Yellow , Classic White and Ruby Red . <p> The Bobber has a tough , sportier and rebellious appearance . It has a smaller but fatter 130/90-16 front tyre , giving it that dual sport look , but more importantly , a bigger contact patch for the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding position , it inspires more confidence when riding spiritedly though the twisty sections . Instead of chrome , the Bobber opted for a matte finish and comes in Black Massif with yellow highlights , and Sports Grey with red highlights . <p> At the heart of the V9 is Moto Guzzis 853cc signature transverse V-twin engine , which was developed with torque in mind , and there is plenty of it . From low revs to redline , the power is constant and abundant . Cruising at 60km/h , you could easily roll on in any gear and the V9 will happily pull away . The engine is so smooth that there is very little vibration through the handlebars cruising at any speed , which is unusual for cruisers . The drive shaft and gearbox combination made shifting gears so effortless , youd think it was made by the Japanese . <p> Both the Roamer and Bobber come standard with immobiliser , advanced dual channel ABS and traction control . Traction control can be turned off pretty easily but we left it on for the ride as many roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was plenty of grip from the Pirellis on the Roamer . Even under heavy acceleration , traction control never had to step in . I really wanted to see what the Moto Guzzi traction control was like , and finally got a chance test it out when we found the right road . We found one that was being resurfaced so it was all dirt and gravel . I was n't sure what to expect so I gave the throttle a small but sharp blip , nothing , no wheel spin . So I rolled on a bit harder , and all I could feel was the Roamer accelerating as though we were riding on dry asphalt . It was such an unusual but reassuring feeling knowing the electronics was doing its job by limiting the torque to ensure I had maximum grip at all time . <p> You can tell that Moto Guzzi has put a great deal of thought into the design of the V9 and built a motorcycle for this century . Theyve included a USB port that can be used to charge external devices such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Multimedia Platform option which connects to the riders smartphone wirelessly to show a whole heap of real time information . Through the smartphone app , the rider can choose to see the speedometer , tachometer , instant power , torque , fuel consumption , acceleration , lean angle and battery voltage . The app can also perform all your usual navigation task , and is also smart enough to direct you to the closest petrol station when you 're low on fuel . <p> Moto Guzzis unique longitudinal engine mount , with its cylinder head projecting distinctly from either side of the motorcycle is a characteristic you 'll either love or hate . A blip of the throttle at idle creates a slight gyroscopic effect which moves the V9 left/right , but this was not noticeable while riding . The placement of the cylinder heads was never a problem during our more leisured parts of the ride . For the faster paced sections on-board the Roamer , I found myself having to shift forward on the seat to grip the tank , and my shin would hit the left engine pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more upright riding position of the Roamer , as I did n't  experience this with the Bobber . <p> After having ridden various cruisers throughout the years , the V9 has definitely made it to the top of my list of motorcycles to own . The unique authentic Italian styling , refined craftsmanship , torquey engine and modern technology undoubtedly ticks all the right boxes .

@@58608540 @7608540/ <h> Interview : Capital Brewing Co . New Craft Brewery In Canberra <p> November 3 , 2016 <p> Taking on the big companies who own most of the beer labels were used to seeing at the pub or bottle-o , craft breweries offer new and unique flavours . The craft beer market in Australia- has grown significantly in recent years . Safe to say , its a pretty good time to be a beer drinker right now ! Our choices are endless , with many different labels offering such different styles . If you do n't  feel like drinking a traditional lager , why not reach for an IPA , saison , stout , or pale ale ? <p> Capital Brewing Co. is one of the newest additions to Australias burgeoning craft beer scene . Based in Canberra , hence the name , the label was launched by a group of friends last year . Included in the founding team are brothers Rich and Sam Coombes , who also founded Batlow Cider Co. and Will &amp; Co. coffee together . Sam is also responsible for surf fashion label The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on his plate before starting a beer company too ! <p> Rich and Sam joined forces with the operators behind iconic Canberra venues Honky Tonks and Hippo Co. , Tom Hertel and Laurence Kain . Through a shared love of craft beer , Capital Brewing Co. was born . The team recruited Wade Hurley as their Head Brewer , whose experience at some prominent craft breweries in California gives him great insight into what makes a good beer . Together the team have set about creating their own contribution to the Australian craft beer scene , with their Coast Ale being first cab off the rank . <p> With plans to launch their own brewery in Canberra this year , Capital Brewing Co. has also been able to take advantage of the new Batlow region hop program . Though the area is predominantly renowned for their apples , a recent successful foray into hop farming means the brewery will be able to use fresh hops in their brews . <p> We recently had the chance to chat with Wade about beer , food , and Capital Brewing Co . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you found between the California beer scene and Australia ? <p> Some of the main differences Ive noticed between the Australian and American craft beer scene is style preferences . In the States people tend to gravitate towards big hoppy IPAs while in Australia low ABV- sessionable beers are more popular . <p> Where do you see the Australian craft beer scene heading ? <p> The Australian beer scene is growing bigger every day . The key to its growth is breweries making tasty approachable beers that everyone can enjoy . After people get a taste for craft beer their palates start leaning towards hoppier and more flavour forward beers . I think IPAs and barrel aged beers will keep gaining in popularity . <p> What attracted you to Capital Brewing Co. ? <p> The opportunity to build a brewery and create my own recipes in Australia is what drew me to Capital . Also , its a great team behind the brewery and I knew working with them would be fun . <p> Youve just done a collaboration with Grifter . What do you enjoy about working with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun learning experience . When you have two Brewers working together you end up using different ingredients and usually come up with a unique beer . <p> You 're using fresh hops from the Batlow region . How will this influence the beers you brew ? <p> Fresh hops gives- beer a unique flavour . The Cascade hops grown in Batlow have a great fruity aroma . I am looking forward to using more of their hops in different recipes . <p> What type of beers would you recommend people opt for coming into summer ? <p> I tend to lean towards lagers and session IPAs during the summer . The warmer weather calls for many beers and the lower the ABV the more you can drink ! <p> What 's the best food to pair Coast Ale with ? <p> Coast Ale pairs really well with seafood . Its light and has a subtle citrus note . Drink one with a prawn pasta or some fresh oysters by the beach .

We were lucky enough to stay there while in the city recently , and it surpassed all expectations of what we had perceived as five-star service . With a history that spans over 80 years , the hotel has had ample time to hone their super high-end offerings , and it really shows . <h> Airport Transfer <p> In the past , we 've found that some airport transfers to hotels just are n't  worth it . The cost is often double that of a taxi and the service usually does n't  justify the price . At The Peninsula Hong Kong , its an entirely different story . Their high-end service began from the moment we stepped off the plane . At the end of the aerobridge , we were greeted by an airport rep whod been assigned by The Peninsula to pick us up via a shuttle cart service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immigration . Hong Kong Airport is massive and the walk takes forever , so this was already a nice start . The rep asked for our luggage receipts , which left me slightly perplexed as I thought they surely must need to know what our luggage looked like to find it . Not so , apparently , because when we got through immigration , it had all been collected by a porter who had neatly stacked it onto a baggage trolley ready to take us where we needed to go . As we were led to the exit by another rep with porter and luggage in tow , we were met with a pretty magnificent sight . Parked exactly in line with the exit door was a Brewster Green Rolls Royce . It sat there gleaming , waiting for us to hop in . Important to note that at this point we had made it through the entire process of arriving at an airport without having touched our luggage once ! <p> 45 minutes , free in-car WiFi , and some soothing music later we roll into The Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . They walked us through the hotel and directly to the room , which is where check-in occurred . Our luggage arrived in the room shortly after we did and we still had n't  touched it once since- leaving our last port . <p> For those who need a faster transfer than a luxury Rolls Royce , The Peninsula Hong Kong also has a helicopter airport transfer available . Well save that for next time . <h> The Peninsula Hong Kong <p> The Peninsula Hong Kong boasts a stellar location , being found on Salisbury Road , Tsim-Sha-Tsui . Right at the doorstep of the harbour , the hotel looks over to Hong Kong Island and its incredible display of architecture and lights at night. - The towering building itself is a sight to see . While the hotel opened in 1928 , a 30-storey extension was added to the original facade in 1994 . The new tower follows the same architectural style of the original building , which exudes a great deal of grandiosity . <p> 10 floors of the hotel are dedicated to office spaces , shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floors houses the Fitness Centre , which is huge and offers such beautiful views of the harbour that it was enough to convince me to get in a couple of work outs while on holiday not always an easy feat by any means . The indoor pool was just something else entirely . Eight floors up and it felt like you were swimming over the city. - With its columns , statues , and friezes , it felt and looked like something from the lost city of Atlantis . <p> The Peninsula Hong Kong boasts conference and meeting spaces aplenty , and even has its own music room complete with a grand piano available for guests to use at any time . <h> The Room <p> The Peninsula Hong Kong offers a nice combination of early 20th-century grandeur and luxury with modern conveniences . This is nowhere more apparent than in their rooms . 2012 saw the completion of a mass renovation of the rooms , which were enhanced with new art , furnishings , and cabinetry . Modern technologies were added as well . Each room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it. - A mere fingers touch controls everything from the lights , electric blinds , and temperature in the room . The tablets also act like your own personal in-room reception too . You can order room service through them , as well as book- house keeping , and even order transport and transfers . <p> We stayed in the Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room , which , as its name suggests , offered a stunning panorama out over the water . Unfortunately , there was some construction right in front of our window that detracted from the view a bit , however , the higher up you go the less you 'll be imposed by such things . Nevertheless , our room was as grand and impressive as you would expect it to be . Featuring highly glossed- burl-wood cabinetry , a bespoke leather lounge and chairs , and inviting , cream-coloured bedding , it was spectacular to say the least . <p> As we first got to our room we were greeted with- refreshments that included freshly squeezed juice , fresh fruit , and The Peninsulas signature chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything youd expect in a hotel room was also included , but on a much grander scale . Complimentary tea and coffee were provided , of course , but instead of two paltry mugs and a couple of sachets of instant coffee , The Peninsula provides a full tea set- and high-tech Nespresso machine . The bedside drawers hid power sockets and a neat bundle of every phone or tablet charging cable you could ever need . Furthermore , the room featured three telephones that could be used to call reception , or could be used to make free , unlimited calls to anywhere in the world . - Yep , free . Unlimited . <p> The bathroom was an extension of the rooms opulence . Swathed in marble , it was large and had separate doors for the shower and toilet . A good-sized tub was the centrepiece of the room , though , unfortunately , I did n't  get a chance to use it . <h> Gaddis Restaurant <p> The Peninsula Hong Kong is home to a plethora of dining options , each with a different culinary theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had lunch at the French fine-dining restaurant- Gaddis . Gaddis has been around for over 60 years and is now headed by much-lauded chef , Xavier Boyer . The decor of the space is extremely opulent .

We experienced the four-course set menu , which was actually pretty reasonably priced at around AUD$100 per person . This also included a glass of wine and tea- or coffee . The wait staff at Gaddis were all highly personable and professional . We had a nice chat with one of them who had just returned from Australia . He was a barista in Perth , and to our delight made us a pretty good flat white upon request . <h> The Wrap-Up The Peninsula Hong Kong Review <p> If you find yourself pining after a truly luxury experience , The Peninsula Hong Kong is one of the best hotels in the world to make it happen .

Sleek and simple , it fits seamlessly into a modern home something you can place on a- table- rather than stash away behind a couch .

On top is a LED indicator displaying different colours to indicate the connection strength and status . <p> The router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully compatible with most internet providers . So setting up is easy " just connect the router to your existing modem or gateway and place the satellite in the centre of your home .

If you 're a more technically experienced user you can just configure it through their web interface . The Orbi can stretch over 370sqm , so you 'll always get excellent coverage . <p> One thing to note is that- Orbi does not extend your existing network as such , but instead it creates a new network between the two units under one name . This means you only need to connect your devices to one network and the Orbi will automatically alternate between the two units to give you the best signal .

Weve been using the crappy default modem that came from our telco for the past year and although the 2.4GHz signal reached most of the apartment , the 5GHz did not . The 2.4GHz speed was terrible and the 5GHz signal was weak , so trying to stream YouTube from the bedroom was just frustrating . <p> We worked out that the cement wall between the living room and bedrooms contributed to the signal degradation .

Were pretty lucky to be living in a time when TVs are getting bigger and cheaper and audio systems are getting better . I have a 55 ? TV at home which has great picture quality but the sound leaves more to be desired . In an attempt to make the thinnest and brightest TVs , manufacturers often have to compromise the size of the built-in speakers and hence the sound performance . Its not unusual to have to purchase a separate sound system if you want good sound . Weve seen sound bars ranging from $200 to thousands of dollars but they also vary as much in quality . So what 's a good all-round system that wont break the bank ? We recently tested the Yamaha YSP-2700 surround sound bar in our office and here 's what we thought . <h> Design <p> The Yamaha YSP-2700 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wireless subwoofer . The sound bar is quite slender and has a beautiful brushed metal finish that would complement the look of any TV set . The subwoofer is a solid cube that can be placed anywhere in the room without compromising on performance . The sound bar delivers clear high and mid-range sound , while the 75-watt subwoofer pumps out strong , powerful bass . Together , they add up to a total of 107 watts , which is ideal for a small to mid-sized room . <h> Surround Sound <p> One of the key features of the YSP-2700 is its ability to pump out awesome 7.1 channel surround sound with just the two speakers . Although , that 's a slight understatement because the sound bar alone is constituted by a whopping sixteen high-quality beam drivers , each powered by a dedicated amplifier . The beam drivers are designed to release focused sound beams into the room . When they hit the walls , they bounce back and converge at one point , creating the " sweet spot " for the surround sound effect . <p> To ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker placement , the Yamaha YSP-2700 uses a calibration technology called " Intellibeam " .

The Intellibeam software then analyses this information and calibrates each of the sixteen drivers to produce beams that are specific to the size and shape of your room . <p> There are other systems in the market that are similar to the YSP-2700 , claiming that they can also do surround sound . However , without Intellibeam they are unlikely to work quite as well . There is a small drawback to this type of dual speaker system , though .

All HDMI inputs and outputs support 4K/60p videos and HDCP 2.2. ( needed for streaming copyrighted 4K content from Chromecast , Netflix , Apple TV and other services ) . <p> Alternatively , you can ditch the cables and go wireless as the YSP-2700 supports Wi-fi , Bluetooth and Apple Airplay . It also has MusicCast " Yamaha 's multi-room audio system .

This hotel is situated amongst a strip of luxury resorts in the Wailea area and boasts being Hawaiis only all-suite and villa oceanfront resort.The place was huge and had a large , open reception area with a fitting tropical vibe to it . The staff at the front desk were super friendly and welcoming when we checked in , and we were shown to our room quickly which was a pretty long walk from reception but was through a nice outdoor corridor . <p> The room itself was also pretty big and felt more like a traditional Hawaiian style room rather than a modern resort room . It still felt quite premium though and everything we needed was provided . The living area was separate to the bedroom which made it feel a bit more homely and less like staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious as it had a bath , oversized shower and , much to my girlfriends delight , separate his and hers sinks. - The balcony of our room had a stunning view overlooking the resort ; the vivid green landscape contrasted with the crystal blue waters of the pools underneath us and made it feel like we were looking at a TV screen instead of a real place . To say it was picturesque would be an understatement ! <p> After dumping our luggage and quickly getting acquainted with the room , we went- back downstairs to check out the pools . The first one we tried had a swim-up bar which made it hard to want to leave to check out the rest of the stuff that the hotel had to offer . We ended up mostly hanging out at the adults only pool which was usually- pretty- quiet and always hard to leave ! Fairmont Kea Lani- leads down to- Polo Beach , which was a nice , small- beach with a good vibe . You can access the beach right from the resort through some winding paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand are lines of beach beds and a hut which had bodyboards , sunscreen and other amenities you might need on the beach . Trust me when I say you will need that sunscreen , and lots of it ! We learned our lesson on our first day in Hawaii when we got absolutely scorched by the sun , even with sunscreen on ! The beach beds were perfect to lay back on and just watch the waves roll in but we decided to get amongst the waves and- went out into the water for a while to work up our appetites for dinner later on.There are a fair few dining options at the resort , and on our first night we opted for Nicks Fishmarket Maui . The restaurant was amazing , and as the name suggests offered mostly fresh seafood . It also had quite a thorough wine list which we definitely explored at length . The atmosphere was- pretty fancy but it still had a relaxed island feel . We found that there was mostly couples remaining in the restaurant as it got later in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the louder pool areas with where there were plenty of kids during the day . The food and drinks were on the pricier side but that- was to be expected at a luxury resort , although they do have some happy hour specials which we made sure not to miss.Overall Fairmont Kea Lani was a great place to spend- some time- in Maui . It was the perfect spot to take a break from exploring- and just spend time relaxing , swimming , tanning , eating and drinking . What more could you want from a tropical Hawaiian holiday ?

A recent trip to Hong Kong found us staying in the newly renovated , - Grand Hyatt Hong Kong , where we found out why exactly the Hyatt name is so universally revered . <h> Grand Hyatt Hong Kong <p> The Grand Hyatt Hong Kong is the chains flagship property in Asia . Since opening in 1989 , its guest book boasts the names of numerous international Heads of State , dignitaries , and celebrities .

The hotel houses over 500 rooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 event spaces of varying sizes . Safe to say , then , that the hotel is grand in more than just name . What struck us when we first entered was how huge and cavernous the lobby was . This is generally a pretty rare occurrence in Hong Kong as space is so precious . The lobby was truly awe-inspiring ; three-storey high marble columns were dotted throughout , while the exaggerated greenery and florals added to the elegance . Polished floors that reflected the ambient lighting gave the area- a sophisticated atmosphere , and of course , the grand staircases that lead up to the mezzanine completed the overall , very dignified look . The lobbys design was crafted very deliberately- to emulate the luxury of cruise-liner travel in the early 20th century . <p> Throughout our stay at the Grand Hyatt , service was always highly attentive and as you would expect from a five-star hotel . We did n't  touch our luggage once at either arrival or departure . Facilities include a heated swimming pool and a big gym with new equipment , both of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> Their Grand Cafe actually had one of the best breakfast buffets we 've experienced .

That 's how fresh it was . <p> Found on Hong Kong Island , the Grand Hyatt is right on the water , facing out towards the stunning sights of Victoria Harbour. - The stellar location is at a walkable distance from the shopping districts or only a short taxi ride away . <h> Design <p> We Australians are always excited to see other Aussies leaving a positive mark internationally .

They executed their ideas really well and created spaces that look and feel high-end but also light-filled , open- and welcoming at the same time. - BAR Studio re-built the rooms and suites , making the- best use of the space and ensuring that the spectacular views were the focal point of each room . We found this to really enhance the experience of staying at the hotel . <h> The Suite <p> During our stay at the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong , we stayed in the Victoria Harbour Suite .

The huge window that lined most of the wall of the bedroom made it seem even bigger again . We left the blinds open in the evening so we could doze off with the dazzling view of the harbour lights in sight . There was no better way to wake in the morning than with the sun rising around us and its light reflecting off the buildings across the water in Tsim Sha Tsui .

Sweeping views of Victoria Harbour could be seen from the windows of the lounge space , while the 46-inch TV and complimentary movies made for a nice way to wind down at night . <p> Something we always take note of in hotel rooms is the quantity and placement of power sockets .

Were not talking about real estate or stocks but looking at an- alternative , fine wines . Before you go trying to sell that $10 bottle of red you picked up after work last week , here are some things you should consider when investing- in wine <h> What Estates/Regions To Buy From <p> Here in Australia , we make some truly world-class wines . Unfortunately , they 're not always- the most sought after when it comes to investing and subsequent selling . The vast majority of investment wines are made in the French regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy . These areas have the ideal climate and conditions for not only producing a high-quality product- but producing it consistently . Bordeaux , in particular , has experienced something known as The Rule Of Fives , in which they produce a truly phenomenal vintage every five years . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current 2015 season due to be released in 2018 . <h> How Long To Keep Investment Wine <p> Its suggested to keep a wine investment for at least five years . Demand and value increase- over time as the product both ages , of course , and becomes rarer over the years . This is thanks to people consuming their wine , so stay strong , resist the urge to uncork and reap the benefits in the future . <h> How To Store Wine Properly <p> Keeping your investment wine in professional storage is a good idea because a ) it will stop you from accidentally drinking it when you 're not in the right- state- to make that call- and b ) the wine will be stored in the perfect environment needed to keep it in- top condition for when you 're ready to sell .

This is to get you a few bottles ( at least ) of the good stuff , plus it factors in such things as the- cost of professionally storing the product and insurance. - When its finally time to sell , you 'll probably use a wine auction service , which will also be an additional cost . <h> What does En Primeur mean ? <p> A term you may see a lot when you 're looking into the idea of investing in wine is En Primeur . Also known as Wine Futures , its essentially the concept of purchasing wine while its still in the barrel usually a few years before it will be released .

@@58608616 @7608616/ <h> Samsung Galaxy TabPro S Review <p> June 20 , 2016 <p> Mobile devices seem to have quite a bit of cross over with each other these days . Some phones are getting bigger and verging on tablet territory , while you can also get tablets which are only a fraction larger than a phone . A hybrid between laptops and tablets is the next natural combination- and one that would be pretty useful . A number of brands have released their own iterations of them , and- Samsung have recently released theirs in Australia ; the Galaxy TabPro S. Weve been testing one out to see how it fares as- a device which theyve touted as being both a fully functional mobile office and personal movie theatre . <p> First off , when it comes to specs , the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is pretty impressive . It runs Windows 10 on a 12-inch Super AMOLED display , with a 128G solid-state drive and a 6th Generation Intel Core M processor . It also features a 5mp front and rear camera . The tablet , sans the keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty , which to me already makes it seem really premium . Combined with the black frame , the TabPro S is a pretty sleek looking device . <p> A big point of difference between the Galaxy TabPro S and other laptop / tablet hybrids is the fact that the keyboard is included with the device . Samsungs competitors make you buy a separate keyboard / case which is pretty annoying if you want to use the product to its full potential . While I definitely appreciate the inclusion of this fairly- vital component , it can be slightly frustrating to use at times . The case , which turns into the stand when using the keyboard , only adjusts to two angles so you ca n't view the screen the exact way- you might need . This is n't a totally insurmountable issue though , - and certainly does n't  detract from the rest of the device . <p> When it comes to actually using it , I 've found the machine itself to be nice and quick . Its easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode with just a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . I 've used it a few times to do some work while in a cafe and was pleased with how quickly it started up ; I was usually typing away by the time my coffee order was even taken . Working remotely is also made easier by the fact that the device is so light , weighing in at only roughly 690 grams , so I can comfortably carry it around in my bag all day . <p> The display is super sharp and colours appear saturated and clear . When I 'm not using it for work , I strip the device of the keyboard and use it in tablet mode to catch up on some shows on Netflix . The picture quality is really impressive , and so is- the longevity of the battery , - even after quite a few consecutive episodes of House of Cards . <p> The TabPro S utilises a USB Type-C connection to charge the battery which offers a couple of advantages over the usual USB Type-A / micro USB connection . Most noticeably , Type-C is skinnier , allowing the profile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery a lot faster , so you 'll go from empty to full in roughly 2.5 hours . <p> The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S has a new feature called Samsung Flow , which basically allows you to connect the tablet to your Galaxy S7 phone via Near Field Connectivity ( NFC ) . You can log into your tablet with your phone , plus you can receive phone notifications from selected apps on the tablet and respond directly from there instead of your phone . This is a- handy feature to have and its saved me quite a bit- of time when working . Its mitigated my need to constantly switch between the two devices to read and reply to notifications . <p> When it comes down to it , I think the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is a great option if you 're in need of a- mobile office . It would also be an ideal secondary device to carry around if you 're on the run a lot , or if you want something which can serve the purpose of being for both work and play .

Better yet if they were your favourite Nike silhouette . We certainly have , and thanks to the recent launch of NIKEiD- in Australia we actually had the chance to .

We tried our hand at customising a few pairs of NIKEiD sneakers to see how it works . <h> Online Editor <p> First , you head to the customise section of nike.com/au and- begin by choosing which sneaker you want to work with .

So goes the story of Volvos much-loved family SUV , the XC90 . Though the car has received a few facelifts and tweaks since its launch in 2002 , it remained largely faithful to the original design . However , as new technologies become available and consumers evolve , so must their cars . With that in mind , last year saw the release of a brand new generation of the XC90 ; a sleek and modern interpretation of the iconic Volvo . We drove one for a week to see how it fares in 2016 . <h> The Car <p> There 's no doubt the new generation of the XC90 looks the part , a contemporary- 2016 vehicle. - It has a really strong aesthetic , thanks in part to new LED headlights and a- larger grille . With quite a few different metallic paint options to choose from , the car looks sleek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which certainly gave it a sharp- look . Overall the 2016 XC90 has a premium aesthetic . The exterior alone is enough to catapult it into luxury car territory . <h> The Interior <p> I found myself incredibly impressed by the cars interior , even just at first glance . The first thing you notice as you get in the drivers seat is the 12.3 ? , iPad-like screen in the centre . Reminiscent of the screen found in a Tesla Model S , its large but not overwhelmingly so . A noticeable lack of physical buttons on the instrument panel gives the front cabin a clean and minimal look , as does the entirely digital dash display . <p> The driver and front passenger seats are incredibly comfortable , and they feature some of the best lumbar support Ive ever experienced in a car . Our model also had heated seats ; a feature I - cant live without now ! The luxuries do n't  stop there though , as both the second and third row of seats prove to be really well-thought out , catering to the comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second row are built on individual rails , allowing them to slide back and forth independently , plus they can recline as well . A spacious third row means a couple of adults can sit back there for shorter drives and not feel cramped . The already substantial 398L boot increases its capacity to a huge 1,091L with the back two seats folded down , which they do completely flat , so it becomes the ideal car when you really need to haul a lot of stuff around . <p> The XC90 features Volvos Sensus infotainment system . Due to the minimal physical controls in the car , most things are controlled through the touchscreen , like temperature , media and the various safety features . Everything about it is pretty intuitive , and if you 're used to using your smartphone or tablet , you wont have any trouble with it . Some of the features were slightly laggy at times , and you have to swipe across to access some of them too , which was n't the easiest when you 're trying to focus on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used it in conjunction with Apple Carplay with my iPhone , which was something I really enjoyed . This allows you to access apps like Spotify or Audible directly from the cars touchscreen , plus with the help of Siri , you can easily make or receive phone calls and hear text messages and voice mails . You can even dictate messages to your phone and have it send without ever actually touching your device . <p> Everything about the 2016 Volvo XC90s interior feels premium . From the leather seats to the contrast stitch detailing , there 's no doubt it can comfortably be compared to leading- luxury brands on the market . <h> The Drive <p> With a 2.0L twin-charged T6 petrol engine , the XC90 certainly feels gutsy for one of the biggest SUVs around . Offering 235kW of power and 400Nm torque , the car is quick off the mark and feels no struggle from its weight and size . It proves to be a very comfortable drive through the city , where it would most likely be spending most of its time .

The car also features engine start/stop technology , a measure used to assist with fuel economy . Though its definitely a useful feature when it comes to saving petrol and decreasing fuel emissions , the brief lag of the engine starting again was enough to find me de-activating it more often than not . <h> The Wrap-Up 2016 Volvo XC90 Review <p> Undeniably a car that would be best suited to a family , the 2016 Volvo XC90 would be on the top of my list of luxury SUVs to consider if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for a very comfortable drive , both in its performance and in the well thought out seating design .

It was only a matter of time then- before- a QT Hotel popped up there , which one did last month . The pairing seems a natural combination with both being quirky , arty , and very distinct . Being fans of other QT Hotels we 've stayed in , like Falls Creek and Canberra , we were keen to check out their newest offering . So on a recent weekend away we found ourselves experiencing the new QT Hotel in Melbourne as guests of QT . <h> QT Hotel Melbourne <p> Like the others in QTs line of hotels , the design and vibe of the Melbourne one is informed by its context . Nestled in the Collins Street Precinct in the citys CBD , also known as the Paris end , the hotel is surrounded by old and opulent architecture . The area was once home to rag traders and luxury French fashion labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , and shops. - QT combines the decadent European influence with a very modern Melbourne touch too . <p> Inside the hotel you 're met with an almost industrial space , combining concrete and steel with lashings of brass and timber too . The lobby has a very eclectic feel that ca n't be pinned down to one particular style or another its just undeniably QT . The hotel chains recognisable look and feel is found throughout the lobby and bar spaces yet it still has its own identity . The designers successfully achieved this by working with local artists and curators to add that distinct Melbourne feeling. - Bespoke furniture is found throughout , as are unique graphics and some really interesting art pieces . Our favourite- piece was the mirrored brick wall created by local artist Dan Moynihan . <p> The hotels location is stellar too . Its close to city highlights like Chinatown and the National Gallery of Victoria as well as cafes and shops aplenty . <h> The Rooms <p> We were instantly impressed by our Executive King room . Featuring a minimalist design , the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet was a nice addition and went a long way in affecting the look and feel of the space . The exposed polished concrete ceiling carried over the industrial style from the lobby while the leather lounges in the room gave it a very homely look . Upholstered in a beautiful leather , the lounges look like theyd wear easily. - Itll be interesting to see how their look evolves over time as the leather ages . <p> The addition of a Bose Soundlink Mini in the room was awesome . Its one of the most exciting sound systems we 've seen in a hotel room in a while . Its sound quality is stellar for such a small speaker , and Bluetooth pairing was a cinch . The best thing about it was how portable it is . We took it into the bathroom and used it to play some relaxing music while enjoying a bath . <p> Speaking of the bath , this tub was one of the nicest we 've used . Its deep and comfortable and the perfect way to end a day of exploring the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive King room , while the Loft room has a window facing tub to allow for a relaxing bath while overlooking Russell Street . <p> A work desk with loads of power plugs and USB inputs was a nice feature of the room , while- details like free high-speed internet and a Nespresso machine with coffee pods were appreciated . The room also featured a large flatscreen TV and the hotel offers free movies so good . It swings out when you want to watch it , then folds back when not in use . This is a nice way of maximising space . <p> The bed itself was super comfortable . It felt like we were sleeping on clouds thanks to the gel pillow top it featured . The mini bar was as quirky as always . Details like this are what makes QT not just a good hotel , but a great hotel . <h> Rooftop At QT <p> What better way to enjoy a city than sitting above it , taking it all in with a drink in hand ? Rooftop At QT let 's you do just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open-air space is the ideal place to watch the sunset over the city . Like other QT establishments , the cocktails at Rooftop At QT are excellent , as is the atmosphere . Having said that , it would be a nicer experience if the outdoor section was non-smoking . <p> Word to the wise get to the rooftop at 4:30 when it opens to nab an outdoor seat as it tends to fill up very quickly . <h> Food &amp; Drinks <p> QT Melbournes European influence is apparent in its dining options , as well as its design . The Pascale Bar &amp; Grill is their fine dining restaurant , offering an extensive menu designed by QT Creative Food Director , Robert Marchetti , and Executive Chef , Paul Easson . Fresh produce is prioritised , with much of it being sourced from the hotels own rooftop kitchen garden . <p> We were excited to see the Tomahawk on the menu a steak we had tried ( and loved ) at QT Canberras Capitol Bar &amp; Grill . We went with other dishes this time , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Grill also has breakfast every day but unfortunately , we did n't  get a chance to experience it . <p> Hot Sauce is QT Melbournes other dining option , doubling as their- very own laneway bar very Melbourne . Go for its refined , Asian-inspired- food options , but- stay for the extensive cocktail menu . The bar staff really know what they 're doing- here . The drinks were so good that we ended up going back twice in a day . <h> The Wrap-Up QT Hotel Melbourne Review <p> QT Melbourne continues the hotel chains streak of well-crafted designer hotels . The attention they 've paid to the fine details and design of the space , as well as the excellent service on offer has made it one of the best hotels in Melbourne right now . QT Melbourne would definitely be at the top of my list if a friend asked me for hotel recommendations in the city .

Similarly , when it comes to buying , if you 're looking at- used cars and would prefer to cut out the middle man , this is a perfect way . I recently decided it was time to upgrade my BMW 3 series but was n't sure about where exactly to start when it came to selling the old one . With this in mind , we 've partnered with Gumtree- to give you some tips for buying and selling your car online . <p> BMW 330i M Sport <h> Buying A Car <h> Research <p> Doing a little bit of research when you begin looking for a car will go a long way . Set aside some time to check out what 's out there and how much similar cars to what you 're after cost . This will give you a good gauge on the value of what you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Ask Questions <p> Suss out as much as you can from the seller when you see a car you like . Ask them questions about the condition of the car , why they 're selling it , and how long they 've had it . Buying a car is a big decision , so do n't  be afraid to ask questions to ensure you know exactly what you 're getting . Gumtree makes it easy to contact the seller through the My Messages feature . <h> Negotiate <p> Negotiating- on price is pretty much part and parcel when buying a car . Do n't  be afraid to do it if you think the price on offer is unreasonable , but do n't  be too unrealistic about it . - This is where it pays off to have done some research beforehand , as you can leverage the price of similar cars to negotiate well . <p> BMW 330i M Sport <h> Meet In Person <p> You obviously want to see your potential new car in the flesh before you purchase it , so arrange a meeting with the seller . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have the car checked out on the spot . Meeting in a public place and taking someone with you is always recommended too . Payment should always be made face-to-face never send or transfer money to someone you do n't  know or havent met . <h> Use Common Sense <p> This goes for pretty much everything in life , but if something looks too good to be true , it probably is . While buying stuff online is pretty safe most of the time , there are dodgy people out there who simply want to take advantage of others . Be wary if you think something is amiss , and utilise Gumtrees Report Ad function , which is found clearly on every ad , when you need to . <h> Selling A Car <h> Research <p> Again , research is important when you 're on this side of the transaction too . It can be tricky to work out how much your car is worth , so seeing how similar cars are priced will help you determine a fair price to set . <h> Clean Your Car <p> This one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how many people do n't  bother with this . Just because the car is second-hand does n't  mean it has to look the part . Before you take photos of it , give it a really thorough clean inside and out . Get into all the nitty gritty bits too , like the wheels . Clean wheels make a huge difference to the overall look of a car , so its pretty important to give them a good wash . Get the car looking as new as possible by getting it detailed before you sell too . <p> The interiors are just as important , so do n't  forget about that either. - In addition to vacuuming the upholstery , floor , and floor mats , we gave our BMW a dust too . Dust that 's collected in crevices like the dashboard and between knobs can make the vehicle look old and poorly maintained . We used a slim paintbrush to get into all the nooks and crannies that couldnt be reached with a duster or cloth . The difference was palpable , and something potential buyers commented on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detailed <p> Give your car a glowing bio in its ad and provide heaps of information about it . Include things like how many kilometres its done , whether it has any rego left , how long you 've had it , and why youre selling it . Potential buyers will be more inclined to contact you if you provide detail . Furthermore , we also found it helpful to have road-worthy reports of our car on-hand should anyone want that information . It also helps to have your cars registration report , which details things like whether it or any of its parts have ever been reported as stolen or if its ever been written off . This gives potential buyers confidence in the vehicle and you 'll be more likely to sell it quicker . <p> BMW 330i M Sport <h> High-Quality Photos <p> No ones going to want to get in touch about your car if your photos are grainy , or they cant even really see the car to begin with . Ensure you upload high-quality photos in your ad , with shots of different angles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something specific about the cars looks in the description , its a good idea to get a shot of it too so potential buyers can get a clearer picture . High-quality photos also make your listing stand out from others , but if you want your ad to have an extra leg up , you can also pay to upgrade it . This ensures more people will see it . <h> Stay- On Top Of It <p> Stay on top of your ad every day so you can see new messages from potential buyers and respond swiftly . Gumtrees app is an easy way to do this and allows you to manage your ad on the go . You can also upgrade your listing through the app , which will make it stand out from others in the same category . <h> Meet In Person <p> Naturally , you want to ensure your car is going to the right home , so its a good idea to meet in person with any potential buyers .

There is a way to break up that monotony though and that 's by going to gyms that offer more than just barbells , dumbbells and treadmills . <p> Ive been going to a- Virgin Active gym for the past 3 weeks and apart from doing the good old bench press and bicep curls I 've been booking into some of their instructor run classes . There are a tonne to choose from but there was one that stood out to- me called ZUU . ZUU is not a Virgin Active thing , its a training regime designed by Nathan Helberg to help people get fit and- improve their overall mobility . <p> I had no expectations booking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn hard workout . ZUU is a training methodology that is actually used by- the elite forces and armed forces . It uses animal movements as its basis for the activities primal pattern movements such as Frog Squats , Bear Crawls , - Slithering Iguana- Plank and Kick Sits- I think you get the idea . <p> The overall benefit of ZUU is improved strength , flexibility , mobility , which leads to injury prevention and also great cardio vascular improvement . The thing about these classes is that everyone else doing it looks as uncool as you do , so you can forget about that . <p> Its not for everyone but if you want to improve your mobility and your cardio then I 'd give it a go . <p> Given the types of moves that you have to do in this workout , I 'd recommend wearing really comfortable shorts . Something that is roomy and- has a bit of stretch . I used to wear Nike running shorts to train in and they are mostly ok but I found that they are less technical in design and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm using- the- Surge Shorts- from Lululemon and they are super comfortable compared to my Nike shorts . Lots of stretch where needed and although theyre- light weight they still feel like good quality. - I was sweating heaps in the ZUU workout but found that the shorts absorbed the sweat and- then dried out pretty quickly. - Theres a convenient elastic loop in the back for hanging your shirt , if you need to take it off .
