@@58756355 @7756355/ <h> The 411 on GMOs and Kids <p> Much of the food we eat today is laced with high risk food ingredients . GMOs are no stranger to most of societys diets , yet it seems the real risks associated with consuming GMOs are unknown to many of those who consume them . <p> Today we discuss everything you need to know about GMOs including what to avoid and how to minimize the dangerous exposure of GMOs on our children . <h> What are GMOs ? <p> Genetically Modified Organisms or GMOs <p> Living organisms whose genetic make-up was artificially manipulated in a lab through processes of genetic engineering . This process has been known to create unstable combinations of a variety of genes including plant , animal , viral and bacterial that would otherwise not exist in nature without the help of crossbreeding methods . <p> There has been debate on the benefits of GMOs , however the only withstanding evidence we have thus far is damaging to those engineering GMOs . There has been growing evidence that connects GMOs with a wide range of health problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . <h> Food Allergies <p> Its no secret that food allergies have reached epidemic levels in children since the introduction of GMO foods . One theorist connects the introduction of GMOs into our food system to the drastic increase of food allergies in children today . When genetically modified soy started to appear in our food in 1996 , there was a 50% increase in soy allergies after only one year . Additionally , peanut allergies doubled over the next 6 years . Childrens bodies are less likely to be able to digest foods containing GMOs in the same way adults can , creating possible allergens . <h> Increased Exposure to Toxins <p> There is no argument that much of the food we eat today is laced with pesticides , herbicides and other harmful chemicals . Because of that , those toxins that are made to help crops flourish without bugs and animals preying on them are then consumed by those who do n't  avoid GMO food . That being said , our children are increased to these toxinsdaily unless a point is made to feed them organic food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops with GMOs lead to gene mutation which causes a decrease in nutritional value compared to their organic counterparts . Though some studies argue that there is no significant difference between GMO and NonGMO crops , it is of concern when we start playing around with the genetic make-up of a crop . Most people also argue that when eating organic non-GMO food , the product is more favorable , crispy and has a longer shelf life . <h> Antibiotic Resistance <p> Some argue that antibiotic resistant genes from GM foods are absorbed by bacteria in our guts during digestion . That being said , if ever a time where bacteria carrying antibiotic resistant genes were to cause an infection , it would in turn potentially lead to issues treating it . Though there is not incriminating proof to prove this theory beyond a reasonable doubt , precautionary measures should be put in place to prevent this from occurring , especially in children who are more susceptible to infections . <h> Hormones <p> The majority of our livestock is fed synthetic hormones that can increase estrogen hormones in women ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for the reproductive system and the creation of the female sex hormone . Estrogen also helps to control bone growth and helps maintain cholesterol levels . On the contrary , too much estrogen has been linked to a variety of issues including , but not limited to , prostate , breast and endometrial cancer . Additionally , when exposed to synthetic hormones , it can increase ones chance of cancer , thyroid disease , infertility , asthma , diabetes , obesity and allergies . Hormones are pumped into cows , chickens and fish in order to make them bigger , faster . In turn , those hormones get transmitted to us upon eating the meat and fish . <p> Since children are more prone to issues , especially related to allergies , its important to have your child drink organic milk or at least replace their daily consumption of milk for soy . Girls are developing breasts way before they should be while some men are developing breasts . On top of those issues , there is a fair amount of arsenic that we are exposed to as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So , how can we minimize the dangerous exposure of GMOs on our children ? <h> Tips for avoiding GMOs : <h> Tip#1 : Buy Organic <p> Certified organic productsare those that do not intentionally include GMO ingredients . Look for products labeled 100% organic or made with organic ingredients . Some products that are organic will have a verifed seal reading : Non-GMO Project . Go to grocery stores that are known for selling organic foods , and try to hit the farmers market once a week to stock up on locally-grown organic fruits , vegetables and meats . <h> Tip #2 : Look for the Non-GMO Project Seal <p> Products that carry this seal are verified to be in compliance with the non-GMO guidelines . These products are independently verified and provide consumers with clearly labeled GMO choices . Examples of these products would have artificial hormone-free on their product packaging . <h> Tip #3 : Avoid at-risk ingredients <p> If the products you are looking to purchase are not labeled organic or verified non-GMO , then there are a few ingredients to avoid that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corn , soybeans , canold , cottonseed , sugar beets and small amounts of zucchini and yellow squash . These crops are typically those that have a higher level of pesticides and herbicides which have been linked to health issues . When purchasing sugar , look to those that have pure cane sugar , and look for dairy products not injected with GM bovine growth hormones . This would include products which have labels such as No rBGH , rBST or artificial hormones . <h> Tip #4 : Grow your own Food <p> There is nothing more assuring than knowing exactly where your food source comes from . When you grow your own food , you know exactly what is being used to help it prosper and you know that pesticides and herbicides are not being used . If you 're in an area that does n't  allow much room for producing your own food , connect with someone who does and invest in their products . That includes meats and dairy as well . <p> In order to ensure that your child is getting the freshest and healthiest ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local farm and farmers market . As much as possible , try to support local farmers . Additionally , visit your whole food or natural health food stores in order to purchase your organic groceries . As a parent , there is only so much we can do to protect our children . Ensuring that our children are eating organic food will help ensure they stay healthy and are n't  exposed to unnatural and harmful chemicals . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Danielle Jones <p> Danielle resides in the Mitten State with her husband , toddler son and two loving pit-bull dogs .

Some runners take these few months to get to know their treadmill , hoping for a random warm day to pop up . Others , however , do everything they can to avoid the " dreadmill " and make their way to hit the pavement each day , even if that pavement is covered in snow . Cold weather running calls for special precautions , special gear , and new training plans . But if you 're new to the winter running thing , you may need some guidance on what you need and how to do it . <h> Cold Weather Running Tips <p> Running comfortably in cold weather- can depend on quite a few variables . How cold is it ? Is there any active precipitation ? What is your personal preference of body heat temperature ? Is there snow or ice on the ground ? All of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need or what to prepare for before you head out the door . But with a basic understanding of your bodys needs when working out in cold weather , you will be better equipped to be ready for those changes . <p> When you are exposed to cold temperatures , your body reacts accordingly to help you warm up . Your muscles constrict , - often causing pain in your extremities and making it harder to breath . Your nose starts running as a response to coat your nasal passages from the dry air . All of these combined can make for a pretty uncomfortable and difficult run . Wearing the correct gear and layering up can help with these inconveniences , but expect your winter runs to simply be more difficult than the warmer months. - <p> In addition to temperature changes , you also have to deal with the lack of daylight . You will have less day time hours to run , perhaps making you change your daily routine or forcing you to run in the dark . Special precautions and added safety awareness have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how to run efficiently and safely during those colder and darker months : - <p> Change your Routine : - Since its now getting light later and dark earlier , you may have to change the time of day that you run . If you cant do that because of work or kids , you will need to take special precautions to run in the dark . <p> Figure Out the Running Temperature : - The outdoor temperature is n't the only temperature to which you have to pay attention to . It is recommended to add an additional 10-20 degrees to the outside temperature ( or " feels like " temperature ) to determine what to wear . Below is a chart to help you decide what to wear- after you have added a few degrees for your body heat while moving . <p> Precipitation : If it recently snowed or rained , you may have to take extra precautions depending on the conditions . Neighborhood sidewalks may not be treated , so if you can run safely on the road it may be the better option . Roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide more traction as opposed to smooth concrete . They are also warmer due to the traffic running over it allowing the snow and ice to melt quicker . <p> Bag Your Feet : It sounds silly , but putting your feet in baggies will help keep out the cold and the wet slush . Just be sure to put your socks on before you put the baggies on otherwise your feet will overheat and stick to the bags , making for an uncomfortable run . <p> Pre-Run Warmup : Before you head outside into the cold , warm up your body inside by doing a few quick exercises like jumping jacks , butt kickers , jump rope , or sun salutations . This will help to not shock your body so much when you feel the drastic change in temperature . <p> Post-Run Change : - No matter how cold it is outside your body will still perspire . The wetness will become apparent as soon as your body realizes its not moving anymore . The wet combined with the cold temperatures will make you feel even colder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body temperature is still high . The best way to counteract this is to change your clothes into something dry following your run . <p> Running in cold weather requires certain things that you may not do during the warmer months , but these pre- and post-run tips will help you have a more comfortable and safer run . <h> Cold Weather Running Gear <p> The best thing about running in cold weather ? You get to buy new running gear ! If you use the cold temperature clothing guide above you can see that some of the items you might need in addition to your summer running gear are long sleeve shirts , running tights , gloves or mittens , and a hat . But there are some other items that you may find beneficial as you hit the icy pavement : <p> Layer Up : Your running temperature will determine how much you need to layer . However , layering is often a work of trial and error for many runners . Some runners like to " embrace the suck " and wear less to start off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  mind taking off layers as they run if needed . It may take a few runs for you to figure out what is comfortable for you . <p> Running Tights : - Basic non-wicking running tights may not cut it if running temperatures are extremely cold . You may need to spring for thermal tights to wear under your regular running tights or pants ( or to be worn by themselves if you 're the " embrace the suck " type of runner ) . <p> Vest : - Many runners complain of overheating in the space that seemingly is n't working as hard their arms . With that in mind , some opt for a thermal vest rather than a layering jacket so that their arms and shoulders stay a bit cooler , but their core is kept warm . <p> Face Mask : - No , you are n't  going to rob a bank but you might look like it . Full face masks are a must in cold and windy weather . Many go over your head for an extra layer of warmth , while others may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pulled down if you get too warm , though . <p> Sunglasses : Sunglasses are crucial during the winter months . Whether you 're trying to protect your eyes from the reflection of the sun off the snow or wind in your face , sunglasses can protect your eyes from more than just regular UV rays even on cloudy days . <p> Snow Chains : - Sure , you have snow chains for the tires on your car , but did you know that you can get- them for your running shoes too ? These chains attach to your regular running shoes and will help them grip in wintry conditions . But caution and common sense are a must during any icy conditions . A skipped run is better than a run that ends in a serious injury . <p> Snow , ice , freezing rain , and extreme temperatures cant stop a dedicated runner from hitting the pavement as long as she has the right gear . So hit the shops to get the things you need to hit the pavement . <h> Cold Weather Running with Kids <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . If you are a runner , you do n't  have to let the cold weather deter you from running outside with your kids . Below are a few things you can do to ensure that your kids are warm and comfy while chilling in their stroller ( seriously , what do- they have to complain about ? You are doing all the work ! ) . <p> Wind Guard : - The most important thing besides coats , hats , gloves , snacks , and the iPad , obviously is a rain cover for your stroller . Even if its not raining , a rain guard helps to keep the cold air and wind out of the stroller . Your kids will be toasty warm under there , and bonus : it will also be harder to hear them whine . <p> Tire Chains : These are n't  actual chains like you would buy for your car or for your running shoes , but tying zip ties around your strollers tires will help add traction when pushing in icy conditions . <p> Footmuff : Footmuffs are great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made just for your stroller , keeping your children warm without having to stop 50 times to pick up and retuck dropped blankets . <p> Running with kids is n't always fun , but its a bit easier when you 're prepared .

Runny noses , tight muscles , burning lungs , and freezing fingers and toes would make anyone want to call it quits. - But with the right gear and the right mindset , you will be running comfortably in the icy weather in no time ! 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Lauren Lomsdale <p> Lauren is a full-time mom of three girls , who also happens to run her own in-home preschool .

@@58756363 @7756363/ <h> 10 Habits of Fit and Healthy Moms <p> They are everywhere : moms that run , moms that strength train , moms that say no to artificial ingredients , and moms that say yes to health . Its a trend that seems to be gaining national attention , with popular hashtag #fitmom bolstering over 4 million posts on Instagram to date , moms are setting out to maintain and inspire healthy lifestyles for not only their children , but for other moms too , documenting every sweaty selfie and spinach salad along the way . Find out what habits are created and maintained daily by fit and healthy moms to build a consistent lifestyle for themselves and their families , and not just a temporary change . <p> Ready to Get Fit 2015 ? Throughout the next few months we 'll be posting regularly about fitness and nutrition . All of us here at Daily Mom will be right alongside you , taking steps to be healthier and offering each other encouragement . Be sure you keep up with our initiative for some great tips , recipes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration on getting fit and being healthy . And remember " this is Daily Mom so we understand the responsibilities that come with having children and families as top priorities . We are here to help each other incorporate fitness and healthy choices into our everyday life . <h> 1 . Create a Routine <p> Those who have created a fit lifestyle know the real secret begins with creating a structured schedule for themselves , and their family . Creating a daily and weekly routine ensures that each days priorities are accomplished like a work out even if your adventure-seeking toddler tries to throw a wrench in from left field . Children and adults alike thrive on consistency ; just ask any teacher and they will tell you , having a routine in place where children know what they are expected to do prevents a great deal of misbehavior . Knowing day-to-day what is expected is motivation to get up and get moving , making you more likely to be productive than waking up each day and winging it , hoping that your children are game for winging it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears on the floor . <h> 2 . Make Exercise a Priority <p> Fit and healthy moms make no excuses when it comes to exercise . Whether its hitting the gym or simply incorporating fun fitness-focused activities with their children , exercise is made a daily priority because of its health benefits and overall calming effects on the body and mind , rather than simply the physical effects of outward appearance . According to the American Psychological Association , exercise has the capability to boost your mood within five minutes of activity , and is also linked to studies that show that exercising releases serotonin , a chemical in the brain that is linked to influencing moods and decreasing depression and anxiety . Moms who have made exercise a daily priority will often say that their workout is their therapy , or even meditation , and missing a few days of exercise in a row has a major effect on their mood , making them irritable and more stressed than usual . Happy mom , happy family , right ? <h> 3 . Meal Plan <p> Those who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right foods is the right way to maintain optimum health . By eating out less ( say good bye to high calorie , high sodium , high fat foods ! ) and creating their own nutritious meals at home , the health-conscious want to know that they are fueling their familys bodies with vitamin-rich , whole foods . Meal planning ensures that not only a budget is created and maintained , but that also the days nutritional goals are met with the proper servings of vegetables , fruit , grains , protein , and dairy . Reading nutrition labels while you shop and learning to cook ( even the simplest of clean eating recipes ) are two tips that are sure to keep your meal planning healthy and consistent . <h> 4 . Sit Down Nightly for Family Dinners <p> After a long day of work or shuffling kids to and from activities , its really easy to throw dinner onto a plate , turn on the television , and watch everyone tune in andtune out . However , an article published by Harvard Medical School says that eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes a person to eat more , even eating past the point at which you are full . Adults and children who eat in front of the television are also more likely to be overweight , often choosing unhealthy snack foods rather than a nutritious meal . Not only does eating dinner around the television lead to unhealthy eating habits , it also detracts from the time that can be spent building and maintaining a healthy relationship as a family unit . Sitting down at the dinner table allows for open conversation , and studies show that families that sit down frequently to eat have less stress and tension in the home . <h> 5 . Sleep Well <p> This is a hard habit for new moms , moms of infants , and even young children as we all know how precious sleep can be , but those who make fitness and health a lifestyle understand that their body does n't  run at its best unless its fully rested . Loss of sleep can result in poor eating habits , weight gain , fatigue throughout the day , and increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six to eight hours of sleep per night should be enough to fuel your body and brain for the day ahead . Try going to bed earlier or scheduling in mini-naps during your childs nap time for a quick pick me up . <h> 6 . Wake Up Early <p> When on a scheduled routine , its important to start the day off right by saying no to procrastination . The morning offers the perfect time to fit in a workout or run prior to starting the day or waking the children , or simply use the extra time to plan out the days events , work on personal goals , and enjoy your coffee in silence . Fit moms know that morning work outs are often the best , offering the most energy and little distraction . They also understand the importance in simply starting the day off on the right foot and feeling good . While hitting snooze is tempting , being in a rush the rest of the day and worrying about fitting in a work out can be even more exhausting . <h> 7 . Eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important meal of the day . Eating breakfast within thirty minutes of waking up jump starts your metabolism for the rest of the day and is more likely to keep you satiated throughout the morning , instead of binge eating whatever is in reach when hunger strikes . Those who maintain a healthy lifestyle understand the importance of eating a healthy breakfast , often opting for protein and heart-healthy grains . Do n't  forget to hydrate and wash down your breakfast with a cold glass of water after a long night of fasting. <h> 8 . Read Often , Keep Learning <p> Those who lead a healthy lifestyle are always learning new ways to enrich their lives . Whether its researching the latest diet trend ( should we all be eating gluten free ? ) , the newest trends in running gear , a daily newspaper , or even an inspirational non-fiction find from the local library , when health is a priority in your life , one wants to learn more about it . Keeping up-to-date on the latest research and current events helps you to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to day activities , and what you should or should n't be putting in your mouth or on your childs plate . Be sure to look up reputable sources when researching topics of interest and always seek second opinions . <h> 9 . Meditate , Pray , Think Positively <p> Going hand-in-hand with waking up early , most moms know the importance of having peace , even if its only for five to ten minutes a day , but those who take health into account daily , act on it . Whether its simply sitting in silence with your thoughts , reading a good book , praying , meditating , or reciting a few positive thoughts aloud about the day ahead of you , give a moment for yourself to simply be . Take a moment to let go of stress , worry , anxiety , or anything else running through your mind and just enjoy the moment . We all know that once the children are awake , chaos ensues , even if that chaos is produced by our favorite little people . <h> 10 . Be Prepared <p> Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fit lifestyle . Preparing for each days tasks are often done the day before . For example , exercise clothing , running shoes , and any accessories needed ( headphones , arm band , GPS watch , yoga mat ) are laid out the night before in preparation for an early morning run ( if everything is set to go , you 're more likely to get up and do it ! ) . Or , reusable water bottles have all been cleaned , filled , and refrigerated in preparation for the day ahead . Preparing for healthy snacks at home , on the go , and for school lunches is also important when maintaining a healthy lifestyle . If your schedule has you and your child out of the house for a while that day , preparing for food on the go is important so that take out is less enticing . Preparing snacks in portable containers prior to leaving the house makes for an easy grab and healthy fill while out and about . Being prepared saves time , which in the end , allows for more opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family . <p> Check out our official Get Fit 2015 page for all the initiative posts in one place . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Stephanie <p> Stephanie is a military wife , currently residing in North Carolina , and mama of two exceptionally curious little ones ; a rugged pint-size princess and a toddling Evel Knievel-in-training .

For days when you need a quick pick-me-up or mornings where you are running to the office and out of time , there is still hope !

However , if makeup seems like a foreign language to you , allow us to give you the low down on this amazing multi-tasking must have . BB Creams were originally introduced into the Asian marketplace but have clearly made themselves a staple on beauty shelves in the US . Short for blemish balms or beauty balms , these little things can pack quite the punch . Its a skin care/makeup hybrid that does the job of many products.Oftentimes , a BB Cream acts as a primer , sunscreen , skin treatment , concealer , and foundation all-in-one . You will find that many of these creams contain ingredients that you would normally find in your creams and lotions .

As the mom of three little girls , I am exponentially aware of body image consciousness . My oldest is only 5 years old and thankfully we have been able to keep those ideas of body shaming at bay . But it wont be long before she can read these headlines and surmise what it means to have a " good " body . Her two little sisters will undoubtedly follow in her footsteps , looking to their- older sister as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this what we are teaching our children that actually matters in life ? <p> The body shaming that Lady Gaga has endured for the past two days is nothing new to our fast-paced world of instant technology , screen grabs , and social media trolls . Other women ( and men , too ! ) celebrities and regular old people like you and me have experienced the Gaga Epidemic where strangers think its okay to attack someones body , character , or lifestyle online . They have found themselves being ridiculed by perfect strangers about their bodies . Strangers who hide behind their screens and who apparently are the Second Coming because they are self-deeming perfection in the flesh tell fellow humans that they are fat , have too much cellulite , and that they need to go to the gym . They will sit on their couches or in their kitchens , telling someone to eat a hamburger or that they are anorexic . <p> When did this become acceptable behavior in our society ? When did we judge our fellow citizens so cruelly ? When did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEOPLE with REAL FEELINGS ? When are we going to remember that these people are mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters who just want to be happy without thinking the Internet is coming at them with pitchforks ? <h> Teaching Our Kids to Ignore the Haters <p> As the old saying goes , " Haters gon na hate . " <p> The mother in me wishes I could send the world into timeout until its ready to behave again , preferably before my daughters hit mid-elementary school ( since that 's when the mean girls really start to make an appearance ) . But the logical person in me ( which is slowly coming back after bearing said three daughters ) tells me that that is n't possible . The best I can do that any parent can do is to teach our children how to deal with the cruel words they will inevitably read online . <p> Because let 's be honest its probably only going to get worse . When I started college , Facebook was brand new . Now there are more social media channels than I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uses , and each one giving ample opportunity for someone to say something mean . If my daughters are anything like me , they will play into what is cool at the time . They will want to take pictures with their friends and they will probably say stuff they will regret . And inevitably they will read things that others say about them that are hurtful , degrading , disrespectful , and painful . <p> The haters are n't  going anywhere . They will all produce offspring that will see their parents glued to their phones , making snide comments to the television or to their partner saying- " OMG did you SEE that ? ! " And those offspring- will grow up to be the haters hating on our children behind a keyboard . But we can counteract that level of mean by teaching our children not to play into it . After all , as the first generation of social media , we have extensive experience on how best not to feed the trolls . Its our job as parents to relay this knowledge down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are looking for a reaction , so do n't  give them the satisfaction of doing so . <p> Respect yourself Know that what these people are saying comes from a dark place . There is no reason to take it to heart , because it does n't  come from their hearts . Respect yourself enough to let go of those words out of your heart . <p> Have confidence If Lady Gaga has taught us anything , its that she does n't  care what the haters say . And you should n't either . Look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself OUT LOUD that you are badass . Because you are . <p> Sometimes it will hurt Sometimes , despite your best efforts , peoples words will cut you to the core . They will hurt , sometimes for days . Sometimes for months . Even years later you may think of those words and feel the sting . But do n't  carry it like a weight forever . Let yourself be hurt and let yourself be mad . But then brush yourself off because the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have yet to explore the treacherous waters of pre-teen and teenage years ( or even the years where my kids can read headlines efficiently and coherently ) but I 'm already mentally preparing myself for the days when one of my daughters comes home in tears because of something someone said to her about her body . I have already started to show my girls what it means to be confident in yourself . Sometimes I fail at this but that 's part of the learning process , too to get back up again and keep moving even when you feel like you cant because the words are weighing too heavy on your chest . The Gaga Epidemic ca n't hold me down , and I sure as shit wont let it hold my girls down either . <p> As a mom , I want to shield them from the Gaga Epidemic . I 'd like to place them ( or at least their phones ) in a little troll-free zone where all nasty comments disappear into the land of jack-assery never to be heard from again .

@@58756378 @7756378/ <p> Remember your first pregnancy ? If you were like us , you were so excited to create a baby registry in preparation for the multitude of showers being thrown for you , but that excitement quickly turned into anxiety as you stepped into the baby store . Who knew that there could be so many baby products , and why are they all so necessary ? Or are they ? <p> The truth is that much of what we had to have the first go round was n't really necessary ( useful , but not necessary ) . In fact , as we prepared for baby #2 , we realized that much beyond milk , diapers , and a car seat , babies do n't  need much . That said , it does n't  mean that we all do n't  still enjoy buying baby products . However , having a little experience goes a long way towards choosing smarter , more natural , higher quality products . When you know better , you do better . Period . <p> Natursutten was founded by a mom of three who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of using them with other parents . By using natural rubber , Natursutten has eliminated the protein that can provoke a latex allergy , other allergy causing substances , artificial color , cancer causing substances , hormone disturbing substances , chemical softeners and parabens , PVC , and phthalates . Their toxin-free baby products that include glass baby bottles , pacifiers , and teethers ensure a more chemical-free future for our children and our environment . <h> Glass Baby Bottles <p> Whether you decide to formula feed or breastfeed , chances are that you 'll eventually be on the search for the perfect baby bottle , and we are really loving Natursuttens glass baby bottles ! <p> But why glass ? While we love the retro appearance of these glass baby bottles , the simple truth is that glass is the safest alternative to plastic baby bottles . Even BPA-free plastic bottles may leach toxic chemicals . Glass bottles are also great because <p> Glass bottles are more thermal and will keep contents warm or cold for a longer time <p> Glass is so much easier to clean <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , glass can last through multiple babies , even generations of babies , where as plastic bottles have to be replaced every now and then . Just imagine , your grandchildren could be fed by the same bottles that you used to feed your babies with . <p> Made of borosilicate glass from France , these bottles are dishwasher-safe and thermal shock-resistant so you can boil or freeze them , or even drop them without scratching ( we 've tested them they wont break ) . Also hygienic , this type of glass is often chosen for laboratories . <p> If you 've struggled to get your breastfed baby to take a bottle , give these a try . The nipples are made in Italy of all-natural rubber , which is free of harmful chemicals . Its natural softness creates a feeding-experience that more closely simulates breastfeeding . The anti-colic double-valve ensures a more even milk flow , preventing colic and gas . And , all parts are free of BPA and other harmful chemicals that can leach from plastic bottles ! <h> Butterfly Pacifiers <p> Another item you 're likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our babies prefer to pacify on mom , but that does n't  mean we wont give these natural rubber pacifiers a try . <p> Made from the rubber of a Hevea Brasiliensi tree , Natursutten makes two types of pacifiers ( original and butterfly ) in two nipple variations ( round or orthodontic ) and three sizes ( small , medium and large , based on age ) . Interestingly enough , it takes about 30 days to make just one Natursutten pacifier because of the curing process for natural rubber , along with the fact that many steps are completed by hand . <p> While these natural rubber pacifiers may cost you a little more than others , they are by far softer than silicone and wo n't leave marks on your babys face . Furthermore , they are uniquely hygienic given the one piece design , with no joints or cracks where dirt and bacteria can accumulate . Weve been trying them for a few weeks and notice that these are much more readily accepted than other pacis . <p> The Original pacifierhas a large round shield that gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural way , and comfort baby in the same way he or she would snuggle up to mom . <p> The Butterfly pacifier has a cut-out on the top which gives the shield a butterfly shape and makes more room for baby 's nose . <p> Both the original and butterfly pacifiers have the option of a round or orthodontic nipple . The round nipple is most like a mothers breast and allows baby to use the same sucking motion that they would use while nursing . However , if you find that your baby really loves their pacifier and you 're worried about the effects of that paci on your childs teeth , you may want to check out the orthodontic option . <p> The orthodontic nipple is designed to prevent tooth misalignment and orthodontic issues later in life , as baby teeth come in and eventually give way to adult teeth . It features a nipple that is flattened on the bottom and rounded at the top and is specifically designed to support the shape of your baby 's developing palate and jaw . While sucking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's nipple to provide the most natural sucking action and reduce pressure on the gums and developing teeth . Studies have shown that orthodontic pacifiers cause less open bite or overbite problems than traditional round pacifiers . <p> If you 're not sure which pacifier will be best for your baby , you may want to give both variations a try . You may find that your baby does n't  prefer a paci at all , in which case these also make wonderful teething toys . And , if you 're really worried about their teeth , just limit how much or often your baby takes a pacifier . You may even consider taking away the pacifier after your babys first year . Either way , just like toothbrushes , be sure to replace your childs pacifier every 6 to 8 weeks . <h> Teether Toy <p> Finally , Natursuttens teether toy might be one of our favorite items from their collection of natural rubber products . When babys first teeth erupt , it can cause the gums to hurt and be uncomfortable . To reduce this discomfort and soothe your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are plenty of plastic products on the market , many of us are looking for an alternative to all the other teething toys that contain potentially harmful materials . The Natursutten Starfish Teether Toy reduces the discomfort while massaging the gums and helping teeth eruption all without any harmful chemicals . <p> Made from the exact same , soft , 100% natural rubber as Natursuttens pacifiers and glass bottles , the teether toy contains no BPA , nitrosamines , PVC , phthalates , chemical softeners , or artificial coloring . What makes this teether different from other teething toys is that it is constructed with two sides of all-natural rubber , fused together by more all-natural rubber leaving a cushion of air in between making it lighter and softer . There 's absolutely no glue . <h> SHOP 170544 @qwx580544 <p> Babies do n't come with an instruction manual , but they do come with a whole slew of challenges and surprises from the everyday to the serious .

But every family knows that pictures rarely go as planned , and oftentimes there are a few tears involved . Despite it often feeling like an arduous task , we still gather the troops to send a smiling card to friends and family every year . <p> So why do we put ourselves through the torture during an already hectic season ? Below are some of the reasons you should send holiday cards , along with some dos and donts , and a few companies who strive to make your holiday card ordeal run a little bit smoother . <h> 6 Reasons to Send Holiday Cards <p> Each holiday season mailboxes are filled with cards from friends and family sending happy thoughts and well wishes to those who mean the most to them . In the rush of the holidays , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing stamps , and mailing out cards to the last minute . But everyone loves to receive these yearly updates , so we continue to carve out some time to complete the task . Here are some reasons why you should send out those cards this year , too : <p> Tradition Families have been sending out holiday cards for generations . The types of cards have changed from handwritten notes to photo cards but the sentiment is still there . In a world where things are constantly changing , its nice to have something consistent during the holidays . <p> Mailboxes Still Work Despite living in a digital media age , people still love to get real mail . Opening a card and seeing familiar names and/or faces make friends and family smile . And why not spread a little joy this holiday season ? <p> Keeping Up with the your last name here You might be a social media queen , but long lost Uncle Joe might not have Facebook . Sending holiday cards to those you love but may not see very often keeps them updated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> Memories One nice thing about the new trend of photo holiday cards is that it ensures you have a family picture at least once a year .

Its nice to look back on the memories . <p> Giving the Warm and Fuzzies Online card designs allow for easier and faster personalization of your holiday cards . Upon receipt , friends and family will know exactly who the card is from , giving them the joyous feeling that you are thinking of them . Everyone likes to be remembered , and real , tangible cards are like small gifts for those important to you . <p> Stay in Touch Despite being in the digital age where we see pictures of high school friends and their growing families every day does n't  mean we have a meaningful connection with them .

Like many things , there are certain social rules of etiquette to follow though . Below are some of the dos and donts when sending holiday cards : <p> DO send photo cards In this age of social media and online orders it is easier than ever to create a photo card . People love to watch your family grow over the years , and photo cards are a great way to make people feel a little more connected to you . <p> DO NT send newsletters Our parents may have typed up long newsletters to send out with each card , but that is not the case anymore . Many people wont read it , and in this day of social media they can easily figure out what 's going on with everyone in your family if they want . If they are really invested in your familys wellbeing , they can call or text . And so can you . <p> DO sign the cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its always nice to add a little personal touch like a written note and signature with the card . <p> DO NT use an iPhone photo Digital cards are great , but not all photos are created equal . You do n't  have to pay hundreds of dollars for a professional photographer each year , but use a DSLR for a high quality photo if you can . It will make the cards look much nicer , and if you are keeping one for yourself it will be nice to have a beautiful picture to look at rather than a grainy one . <p> DO add the year This is a simple addition to make sure you remember which card is from which year if you are keeping them over the years . <p> DO NT send an e-card When sending an e-card your good intentions are there but the sentiment is not the same . Sending a real , tangible card that people can put out as decoration means so much more than an email . <p> DO send them out early Do n't  wait until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it the season will be over and your sentiment will be lost once the holidays are over . <p> DO include your return address This will help those who want to send you a card back have your current and correct address without having to track you down for it . <h> Holiday Cards <p> There are so many different options when looking for holiday cards .

The leading suspects include nipple damage ( often from an incorrect latch ) , poor diet , vaginal thrush , and a compromised immune system ( and/or recent use of antibiotics ) . <p> Even if one person in the nursing relationship does not show any symptoms , this does not mean that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why thrush is so challenging is that it is passed back and forth between mother and child . Therefore , both persons need to be treated . <h> What does it look and feel like ? <p> Infant : <p> Oral thrush is characterized by white spots or patches in the mouth . In more severe cases , the tongue may be coated white , along with the insides of the cheeks . A sore throat may accompany these more severe cases . <p> Genital thrush starts with small red bumps and does not respond well to normal diaper rash creams or is recurrent . <p> Mother : <p> Nipple thrush is characterized by nipple pain and/or deep breast pain . Nipple pain is often described as burning or itching , while breast pain is more of a deep stabbing or shooting sensation . Pain in the breast or nipple often occurs during or immediately after feedings . <h> How do I treat it ? <p> Infant : <p> Firsttalk with your pediatrician . Your pediatrician may prescribe you a medicine called Nystatin , an anti fungal cream , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pediatrician about giving your infant acidophilus , a specific probiotic strain , to help boost their immune system . You can give it to them 4-5 times a day by sprinkling some of the powder from a capsule and letting them lick it from your finger . <p> For the diaper area , clean them with a vinegar and water solution after each changing . You should make a solution of approximately 1 cup of water with 1 T vinegar and have it ready for use . This solution will help kill the yeast present on the skin . It is recommended that you not use a standard baby wipe when cleaning the diaper area . Use a clean cloth with water only to clean the area and follow up with the vinegar solution . <p> After cleaning with the vinegar and water solution , apply an anti-fungal cream such as Nystatin or Lotramin ( commonly used to treat Athletes Foot and available at the drug store ) . <p> Mother : <p> Again , talk with your childs pediatrician . You may be prescribed an antibiotic . Talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One potential problem is that an antibiotic will wipe clean both the good and bad gut bacteria in your system . You may consider trying an approach without the antibiotic for a few weeks first and then using this method as a last resort . <p> Take acidophilus tablets up to 6x day to help populate your gut with healthy bacteria . This will help fight off the bad bacteria in your system and keep it out . <p> Take garlic capsules to help boost your immune system . Find a high quality brand like Kyolic . You should aim to take up to 6 capsules a day . <p> Take echinacea to also boost your immune system . Since echniacea can become less effective over time , take it for 10 days and then take a few days off before starting another round . You can take up to 4 tablets a day . <p> Take grapefruit seed extract . You can buy this both in tablet form or in a liquid concentrate . If you buy the concentrate , you can add it to your water bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most powerful and natural anti-fungals you can use . Remember to take it daily . <p> After feedings , apply the vinegar and water solution to your nipples and allow to air dry . You should also try to expose your nipples to air as much as possible since yeast thrive in dark and damp areas . <p> Reduce sugar and refined carbohydrates in your diet . Yeast live off of sugar and since thrush is a system-wide problem , you have to kill the yeast living in and outside of your body . <p> Lastly , apply Nystatin , or Lotrimin to your nipples after feeding . Your pediatrician may also prescribe you Jack Newmans All Purpose Nipple Ointment , an anti-fungal ointment that also contains a pain reliever to soothe sore nipples . <p> Talk with your pediatrician about using Gentian Violet on the nipple area at the beginning of treatment . Gentian Violet is available in most pharmacies or online and has been used to treat thrush successfully for many years . However , Gentian Violet has recently been scrutinized due to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice . Most pediatricians continue to find it safe if used correctly ( including breastfeeding advocates Dr. Jack Newman and Dr. Sears ) , but like any medical issue , this discussion and debate is best suited with your trusted medical professional . <p> Feeling afraid after reading about how best to treat thrush ? Do n't  be . This list seems intimidating , but once you get your treatment arsenal assembled and ready , you 'll be able to kick it from your system . We recommend doing ALL of the above to treat thrush . If you pick and choose , you might find a brief remission of symptoms , but it will likely return in full-force .

Going to try all these recommendations and get the script filled that he pediatrician wrote for in case we needed it ! <p> One question about the vinegar solution- should I use organic apple cider vinegar with the mother or plain distiller white vinegar ?

@@58756395 @7756395/ <h> Celebrating Hanukkah and Christmas <p> Years ago , interfaith families faced what was called the " December Dilemma " : whether to celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah . With the increase in Christian-Jewish marriages , however , it has become much more commonplace to celebrate both , but many interfaith families still choose to focus on only one . If you 're faced with this choice for your family , or perhaps seeking to understand these choices , read on for some reasons families give for celebrating , or not celebrating , both Hanukkah and Christmas . <p> For those parents who are deeply religious , raising a child in two different religions , or at least celebrating the holidays of another religion , can be quite conflicting . A parent may feel that embracing both faiths may represent more of a mixed , or diluted , faith and that the child may not ever fully be a part of either . Indeed , many Rabbis advise on choosing one religion for the child . A parent may also simply wish for their child to experience the same faith community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is to provide their child with a strong foundation in one religion , regardless of which one . <p> Parents who do not strongly identify with their respective faiths also face a dilemma when it comes to celebrating Hanukkah and Christmas : should other religious holidays ( Easter , Passover , etc. ) also be taught and celebrated ? Some parents may worry that by celebrating both , children will see their situation as simply an opportunity to collect more presents . <p> Despite such concerns , many interfaith families today teach and celebrate both and cite various reasons for doing so . <p> One argument is that the holiday season is more about celebrating traditions , culture , and history . After all , many Christmas traditions may have pagan or pre-Christian origins . With many non-Christians partaking in Christmas celebrations , it has become a secular holiday for many . Some Jewish families like to celebrate Christmas so that their kids do not feel " left out " among Christian peers . More importantly , gaining familiarity with both holidays and religions makes a child more culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorating a Christmas tree or lighting a menorah , even if they are too young to understand its religious context . For many adults , family traditions such as these are among ones most cherished childhood memories . <p> Further , regardless of which religion a child may ultimately choose , parents want their children to know their heritage on both sides of their family . <p> Many interfaith communities aim to educate , not preach , Christianity and Judaism . The Interfaith Community , a nonprofit group throughout the nation , acknowledges Christianity and Judaism are different but both equally valid paths to God which provide guidelines for living morally . Their objective is not to raise children in both religions but to educate them and provide them the tools to do with what they wish when older . <p> Many families see no issue celebrating both Hanukkah and Christmas since both are intertwined . After all , Christianity sprang from Judaism . Jews still recognize , and study , Jesus as a historical figure . <p> Some argue against raising kids in two faiths on the grounds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are actually pretty good at handling conflicting stories or embracing multiple identities . Its only as adults that we tend to prefer a single " truth " . <p> And there are certainly advantages to raising a child in two faiths . By doing so , one gives the child the understanding that there are many different views in the world . Interfaith experiences can also teach kids to respect the value in other peoples views , religious or not . Further , interfaith kids can go on to become bridge-builders among different groups . And from a purely practical standpoint , bringing a child up in both faiths makes it easier for extended family of both faiths to connect with the child during the holidays . <p> Choosing one religion and set of holidays works for many families , but not all . If you and your family decide to celebrate both holidays with your children you 'll eventually have to contend with questions from your children ( but then again , children ask questions no matter what ! ) . A great explanation about the holidays is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you do n't  have to be Christian to celebrate Christmas . Its nice to help others people celebrate , much like its fun to celebrate another persons birthday . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Laura <p> Laura is a wife and a new mom living on the East Coast .

Sometimes they are not happy to go in the car and complain about being uncomfortable while riding . We have all faced the sad looks and the whiny voices , many times even before strapping them in . It can be a battle ! One company knows these challenges first hand and they have constructed a car seat that can handle almost any fussy car rider . <p> Not only are these car seats comfortable , but Recaro makes sure that they are tested very carefully for safety .

It offers Dura Flex fabrics which are not only comfortable , but also easy to clean and breathable . This fabric balances the temperature of the seat and combined with the built-in shell vents and air flow channels , this creates a Dual Air Flow Comfort System . All of these features can limit a childs ability to overheat within the car and keep them comfortable . <p> The Roadster also features Cloud Comfort Memory Foam which is wonderful for long trips in the car .

No more bothering with straps , buttons or Velcro in the back of the seat . You can adjust the height of the headrest and the location of the shoulder straps using the knob on the side of the seat ! <p> Another very convenient feature is the chest-clip storage pockets that are located on the side of the seat .

@@58756400 @7756400/ <h> Juicing for Energy and Health with Project Juice <p> Being a mom is both a thankless and rewarding , albeit a very busy task . Between soccer drop offs , sick days and nights up with a crying and colicky baby there are countless reasons why moms ( all parents really ) have a hard time finding the energy to make it through the day . Many turn to caffeine , and we certainly are n't  dissing that option we at Daily Mom are hardcore caffeine lovers ! However , juicing is something you 've certainly heard about , read about or tried at one time or another . Fresh juices are an amazing craze that will hopefully never go away.They come with a long list of benefits , but like anything else health or nutrition related , it will serve you best to be informed . Today we are prepared to bring you a little bit more information on juicing , how to use it to up those ever dropping energy levels , and talk about what all the hype really is about . New moms , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicing while breastfeeding as well ! <p> Number one parent complaint ? Probably busyness or exhaustion . And while in a perfect world we would love to try to cut out some of the business in favor of a simpler life , this just is n't always a possibility . How about instead of stressing about all the things that you cant seem to fit in , you start being mindful of what you do accomplish everyday , and in addition to thinking positively you also start flooding your body with super nutrients ! Fruits and vegetables fortify your body with both vitamins and minerals as well as the all-important phytonutrients . Phytonutrients are powerful tools for cleaning up your body and facilitating a healing process . <h> How is your food digested ? <p> Unhealthy foods , especially when you are busy , certainly have some sort of romance about them . Although they are quick and easy , consuming all of these foods can do a number on your entire body . It takes your body a lot of work to break down the food or fuel that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the body . Digestion begins in your mouth when you start salivating and continues down your esophagus ( the simple tube connecting your pharynx or throat with your stomach ) to your stomach . Once in the stomach , food is squeezed and mixed with digestive juices that are released from specialized cells in walls of the stomach . These juices include hydrochloric acid , which kills microorganisms and activates an enzyme called pepsin that helps break down proteins , and intrinsic factor , which is a substance that helps the small intestine absorb vitamin B12 . The lining of the stomach contains cells which help produce mucus to help protect the walls of the stomach from damage due to the acid . <p> From the stomach your food travels to the small intestine which is ironically the longest portion of your digestive track . Here there are three different sections the duodenum , the jejunum , and the ileum . The small intestine is mainly where digesting is finished and the absorption of nutrients begins . Aiding in this task are a few other organs including the pancreas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your digestive system is the large intestine or the colon . The material that 's left after digestion and absorption travels here . The large intestine then removes water , salt , and some nutrients , forming stools . <p> Understanding all that your body goes through is important , because now you can see why your digestive system and some of your vital organs may need a little bit of a break sometimes . <h> Giving your Body a Break <p> Swapping in that bowl of cereal or mid-morning snack will be a decision that will allow your body ( mainly the digestive system ) to thank you . When juicing , you do lose a little bit of the benefits of consuming added fiber ( more on that in a little bit ) , but it absolutely does take your body considerably less energy to digest food in its liquid form . By adding juice in place of an unhealthier choice , you will be : <p> Resting the Stomach Liquids require less of the stomach 's digestive processing ( churning , acid and pepsin ) allowing nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gut Toxic foods , medications and stress all take their toll on the functioning of your intestine . An imbalance in your gut microbiome can happen very easily . By adding fresh juice into the rotation you are consuming a more phytonutrient-dense food that can be assimilated quickly through the intestine " consuming less energy , while the toxin-free , nutrient-dense food helps to repair the gut itself . <p> Resting the Liver Your main detoxifying organ is your liver . The molecules of food absorbed through your intestinal wall then move into your liver for detoxification and preparation before being allowed to enter the rest of the body . Many times though there are too many toxins for your liver to weed out , making its job very difficult and allowing for toxins to accidentally pass through and wreak havoc in other parts of your body . Drinking organic juices can allow your liver to get a bit of a break . <h> Juicing for Energy <p> Now that you understand how juicing can aide your body , let 's discuss how it can help with your energy levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide your body with both the physical and the brain power that you need to increase your energy . Green juices are especially great for energy , one of the main reasons being because they are filled with chlorophyll . This green pigment found in plants helps oxygenate the blood , creating increased brain function and physical energy . The miraculous substance of chlorophyll is identical to hemoglobin within the body . Because of this similarity some people believe that chlorophyll can actually be converted to hemoglobin , which will increase the quality and quantity of red blood cells , boosting your energy and increasing well-being . Since cooking breaks down chlorophyll , juicing is the best way to ensure that your body is getting enough ! <h> Cold Pressed Juice <p> Juices , by their nature , are raw foods . They retain powerful nutrients that would otherwise be destroyed by cooking . These include B vitamins and especially digestive and anti-inflammatory enzymes . If you are going to use juicing as a means to increase your intake of nutrients you want to focus on your juice being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw . Organic goes without saying . By drinking organic juices you are avoiding all of the harmful chemicals and pesticides often found on conventional produce . This will further enable your body to properly do its job without overloading your liver with toxins . If you are making your own juice at home , you obviously can rest assured knowing that you are using fresh fruit and vegetables . If you are opting to purchase juices from a company , a great term to look for is " cold pressed " . This type of juice is made with a hydraulic press that uses thousands of pounds of pressure and extracts the maximum amount of liquid from fresh fruits and vegetables . Because this process uses no additional heat or oxygen there are no nutrients lost . Traditional types of heat pasteurization can kill off these nutrients , ultimately making it more difficult for the body . <h> Juicing While Breastfeeding <p> Juicing can be a great way to help both your body and your little ones body receive necessary nutrients . A juice cleanse or any cleanse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the proper time to try to detoxify your body ; rather it is the time to make sure your body is properly nourished . Therefore , breastfeeding moms should not jump right into a juice cleanse . Rather you should supplement your already existing healthy diet by adding in an array of fresh juices . <p> Busy moms everywhere can rest assured that whipping up your own fresh juice at home certainly is not the only option that you have.Project Juice is a fantastic company based out of California ( they ship throughout the US ) selling custom juice packs , cleanses , wellness shots and more !

@@58756411 @7756411/ <h> Tips &amp; Tricks For Dealing With Infant Acid Reflux <p> Is your child constantly irritable and continuously spitting up ? Do they shriek from pain when they are laying flat on their backs ? These may all be signs of something called- gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) , and were here to reassure you that you 're not alone , and we have some suggestions and tips to help suppress the tears ( yours , as well as your babys ! ) <h> What is infant reflux ? <p> To put it into simple terms , its " heartburn . " Its when the stomach contents move into the esophagus and/or mouth . In infants , that could be either milk , or stomach acid . Around 25% of babies have some degree of gastroesophageal reflux- ( GER ) , ranging from mild ( where they painlessly spit up numerous times daily ) to severe ( abdominal pain , waking at night , colic symptoms . ) Its now known that the diagnosis of " colic " in the past , can likely be pinpointed to GER . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reflux , so the correlation between the two may or may not be coincidental . GER occurs when the lower band of muscle that is supposed to act as a one-way valve allowing food and liquid into the stomach is immature and not quite developed enough . This band of muscle is more relaxed , which allows for reflux back into the esophagus and possibly the mouth . The contents irritate the lining of your esophagus , and that is what we , as adults , label " heartburn . " We also know that there are two types of GER associated with infants : gastroesophageal- reflux , and- laryngopharyngeal reflux , also known as " silent reflux . " Silent reflux occurs when the baby is able to swallow the contents back down , but not before the contents irritate the esophagus . This type can be much more difficult to diagnose , because it wont be as obvious as having been spit up on hundreds of times throughout the day . It is possible for a child to suffer from both types simultaneously . <h> What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffer from silent reflux may have some or all of the symptoms , while infants with GER will- spit up- and exert some or all of the following symptoms : <p> Sour breath and wet-sounding burps <p> Sudden bouts of intense crying <p> Trouble breathing or asthma-like symptoms , or pneumonia <p> Baby pauses while breathing ( apnea ) , or breathes noisily <p> Difficulty feeding <p> Frequent hiccups <p> Spitting up or vomiting <p> Inhaling food <p> Hoarse voice <p> Difficulty gaining weight <p> Coughing <p> Gagging or trouble swallowing <p> Irritability , particularly after feedings <p> Arching of the back " often during or immediately after feedings <p> Poor feeding or refusal to feed <p> Cries when positioned flat on their back <p> Colic <h> Now What ? <p> All is not lost ! Keep in mind that this is an actual medical condition , and options for treatments should be discussed with a board certified pediatrician . They may suggest placing them on a prescriptive medication , or start a different regiment to help suppress the symptoms as much as possible . A huge culprit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastfeeding , that in turn , means- your diet. - Breast milk has a huge advantage over formula for babies with reflux , because it contains enzymes to speed digestion . Additionally , a baby can not be allergic to its mothers milk itself , compared to a specific type or ingredient in formula . A baby can be sensitive to something the mother is ingesting , however , and the most common culprit is dairy . In many cases , eliminating dairy from the mothers diet can calm the symptoms of reflux , but its important to note that it can take upwards to two weeks for all traces of dairy to leave your body . If you are formula feeding , use a hypoallergenic variety of formula recommended by your doctor . ( And check out this post on What 's In Your Babys Formula ? ) <p> Offer smaller feedings more frequently . Avoid over-stuffing your baby , or allowing them to space out their feeding sessions , and binge when the time comes . When smaller amounts of milk are in the stomach , digestion is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is your baby gagging during your first forceful letdown ? Try pumping before offering them the breast , to eliminate that first flow of milk that could be gagging them , and causing them to choke . You can either choose to store the milk by freezing it for later , or offer it to your baby at the end of the nursing session in a bottle designed to reduce colic such as these Tommee Tippee Anti-Colic Bottles. - Changing the position in which you feed your child is also important , and feeding them at an inclined angle may help reduce reflux , and will help aid digestion . <p> Keep your baby upright and still after a feeding . Let gravity do its part by keeping the baby in an upright position for at least 30 minutes after they eat . When they are flat on their back , it will be harder for the muscular band to remain shut , and more spitting up and discomfort will occur . Dr. Sears suggests sitting with your baby in your lap , with their head nuzzled against your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place them in this position such as a Skin to Skin shirt , or Moby Wrap featured below . ) <p> Let them sleep comfortably. - Finding out your infants preferred sleep location , position , or angle is kind of a game of trial and error , in many cases . Does your baby sleep well in their swing ? By all means , let them sleep in their swing . Now is not the time to worry about what inclined sleeping may be setting you up for weaning them from it in the future . Most babies outgrow GER by the time they are 6-9 months , so you can rest assured that you wont have to worry about being tasked to build an adult sized swing for them to take with them to college to sleep in . <h> Are there products that can help ? <h> Sleeping : - <p> Sometimes , all that babies with reflux need is a bit of motion to help them sleep , or stay asleep , whether that movement be through vibrations , rocking , or swaying .

Do not discredit something because it did n't  magically allow you hours of uninterrupted sleep the very first night though . Its a learning curve , and what may not work one night may turn out to be their preferred method or angle of sleep after a while . <h> Eating : <p> As mentioned above , nursing or bottle feeding your baby with their body at an inclined position has been found to speed digestion , and decrease reflux .

The pillow is 100% natural cotton , keeping it soft and comfortable , and you can use the Gia with or without a decorative ( yet functional ) cover . <h> Out And About : <p> Positioning your infant after feedings is also very important , as having a full belly is often the most painful time for babies that suffer from reflux . Keeping your baby in an upright position for at least 30 minutes generally helps , however , few mothers have the time to remain seated for such long periods of time . While you wo n't want to jostle or do too much activity wearing your baby , using a wrap is a great option , and our favorite woven wrap to maintain this position is the Moby Wrap . <p> The Moby Wrap uses the entire back and shoulders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your little one .

These shirts truly are 3-in-1 ; they are a carrier , a nursing top , and a postpartum shirt that supports your belly .

@@58756413 @7756413/ <h> How White Noise can help you and your baby sleep better <p> Sleep . Its desired by mothers everywhere , yet fought by infants to the nth degree . We joke , almost hysterically , as we navigate our new world with very heavy eyelids , that one day our children will sleep til noon , avoiding teenage responsibilities and household chores . We hang tight to hope hope that one day we might come to know what a full nights sleep feels like . And thus , we read . We read every book offering tips and tricks to getting a baby to sleep through the night or go down easily for a nap , and we implement every trick with high expectations . While using infant swings , regulating room temperatures , designing a routine , and installing blackout curtains can certainly help , we found one tip that greatly intrigued us because of its soothing capabilities for both mom and baby : white noise . <p> For years , we have relied on white noise to bring peace and tranquility to otherwise hectic places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bustle of a busy city quickly discovered success in the constant whizzing of a fan or the static noise of a dead radio station . Those living amongst the fields and quiet of farm life found open windows and a steady stream of crickets chirping to be enough of a lullaby to induce a deep sleep . And , young mothers quickly found that the hum of a vacuum soothed a sleepy baby and drowned out the sounds of siblings or neighbors . While were sure we could all use a daily vacuuming spree , we luckily have the technology today that offers the same soothing sounds without the physical activity and forced cleaning : enter , white noise . <p> As moms that love sleep , we love all the ways that white noise can help you and your baby sleep better : <h> 1 . Mimics the sounds of the womb <p> Your baby gets used to a lot of incredible sounds during his time in the womb the thump , thump of moms consistent heart beat , the muffled sounds of your voice , the grumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being taken , in and out . Do n't  forget all the fluids in motion throughout your body , and its safe to say that your baby is in for a huge change when he enters the world . Adjusting to the outside ( of the womb , that is ) is scary with a sudden change in sounds and movement , so why not do your best to mimic the sounds of the womb to help ease the transition and make a calming atmosphere for sleep ? 170546 @qwx580546 <p> This is why we love the LectroFan . With six fan sounds , six white noise sounds , and 18 nursery rhymes , any nursery can be transformed into a baby oasis . Not only is the white noise machine a nursery staple , this particular machine is also incredibly portable , powered via USB , ensuring your baby will sleep comfortably wherever you put him down whether that 's in the living room , grandmas house , or even the car . <p> LectroFan also has multilevel adjustable volume allowing you to select the volume based on your babys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure realistic sounds sounds that your baby will recognize and sounds that will soon become familiar and soothing . Which leads us to our next point <h> SHOP 170544 @qwx580544 <h> 2 . Provides noise in a relatively quiet world <p> Its true the sounds of the womb are incredibly loud to a baby ! Think about how loud your stomach can growl sometimes those in the same room as you can hear it then take note that a baby in utero is hanging out right up against all those moving , grumbling , and gurgling organs . The sounds of the womb are almost as loud as a lawn mower consistently going all day and all night long . When a baby enters the world , things are relatively quiet in comparison , and perhaps even quieter as we as parents think that any amount of noise might be too much for a young infant . Sleep machines provide babies with the same , loud environment that they are used to . While many of the cute infant sleep machines and sleep aiding stuffed animals advertise peaceful sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for babys new environment . <h> 3 . Drowns out all other alerting sounds <p> Murphys Law : anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . Or , in the case of a sleeping baby , disruptive sounds will wake said baby . Whether its a siblings sudden scream , the dogs barking , the garbage truck , or the expected ringing of a doorbell , every day sounds that normally do n't  bother us will all of a sudden become our biggest pet peeves when a baby is napping . But , with the help of a sound machine , the soothing white noise easily drowns out all other sounds . And this is n't just because you crank up the volume , but because the variation of high pitches and low pitches in white noise actually helps to block out all other sounds by making it difficult for your brain to pick out individual tones . Who knew ? <h> 4 . Serves as a Form of Comfort and Familiarity <p> While we already know that white noise can mimic the sounds of the womb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of familiarity with sleep . By playing white noise consistently in babys nursery or during nap time signals to the baby that it is time to rest . Your baby becomes familiar with the notion that this noise means catching some zzzs , making the transition into nap or bed time an easier adjustment . What 's even better is that during moments of restfulness mid-sleep , the lull of the sleep machine can help ease baby back into a deep sleep , helping to prevent those short little cat naps that babies are so notorious for ! <h> 5 . Reduces Stress <p> Our world is stressful enough for us , so it has to be stressful to a baby who has no control over their environment and does n't  understand what is going on around them . The soothing sounds of a white noise machine provide stimulation that a young baby craves in the midst of an unknown and often chaotic world . <h> 6 . Because baby sleeps better YOU sleep better <p> Welcome to your new life ! When baby sleeps , we all sleep or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should . Whether that 's realistic in the midst of our fast-paced and often chaotic lifestyles , were not sure , but we do know that a well-rested baby is a happy baby and a happy baby makes for a happy parent . With a more peaceful home and longer periods of sleep , both mom and dad can also take comfort in getting the most of their own sleep schedule .

You may even want a tattoo to mark this joyous occasion . What is the risk to you , and more importantly , what is the risk to your baby if you decide to get a tattoo while you are pregnant ? <p> The problem that most experts have with pregnant women getting tattooed is that you simply do not know how it could affect your pregnancy . During pregnancy your immune system is suppressed as it adjusts to supporting this new life and the trauma of a tattoo could be enough to cause complications . Not to mention that if this is your first tattoo , you are unaware of the side effects that may occur for your specific situation .

However , when you are pregnant or nursing , most of those options are not recommended . <p> Before we discuss how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of congestion . <p> Congestion occurs because the lining in our nasal passages has become swollen , due to irritation from a virus , bacteria , allergens or other foreign substance.Our body then begins to fight the irritation off , causing us to feel incredibly congested even before we experience an increase in mucus production . <p> From there , our immune system starts producing histamine , which triggers our body to go into protective mode . Once your body is in protective mode , you experience an increase of mucus , in an attempt to get rid of the foreign attackers that moisten your airways , and blood flow increases to your nasal lining making you feel congested . <h> 1 . TRUE Hepa Air Purifier <p> One way to proactively fight allergens and get ahead of a cold is to keep an air purifier in the main living areas of your home , such as your bedroom . While some seasonal allergies ca n't be avoided , reducing allergens in your home can make a huge difference in improving your symptoms . As an added benefit , the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a white noise sound machine making it perfect to keep near your babys room . Clean air and a sleeping baby what more could you want ? <p> In addition to regularly changing out your homes air filters , Honeywell air purifiers are often recommended by physicians and allergists as part of an overall allergy treatment program ; and are safe for children as well as expecting and nursing mothers . Their highly effective air purifiers capture 99.97% of the microscopic particles ( 0.3 microns and larger ) that pass through their filters . Furthermore , their True HEPA air purifiers ( such as the HPA 200 ) are efficient at capturing airborne particles like dust , pollen , tobacco smoke , cooking smoke , fireplace smoke , pet dander , mold spores , and certain germs . <p> Featuring 4 cleaning levels ( general , allergen , germ and turbo ) , an automatic shut-off with 3 different time frames ( 2 hrs , 4 hrs and 8 hrs ) , and a light dimmer ; the HPA-200 TRUE Allergen Air Purifier may not take up much room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Even better , it also has the ability to reduce unpleasant household odors ( stinky diapers , litter box , etc ) and VOCs/Gases with the activated carbon pre-filter . <p> And , its easy to use and maintain . Simply tap the Power setting on the control panel and it responds to your touch . Choose the " Germ " or " Allergen " setting and the air purifier automatically maximizes its performance during cold and flu season , or peak allergen season eliminating any guesswork on your part . Maintaining is just as simple : replace the pre-filter every 3 months and the HEPA filters once a year . You do n't  even need to remember when a filter light will remind you when its time to change the filter , no tools required . <p> Honeywell True HEPA air purifiers ( including the HPA-200 ) do not release ozone back into the air from the filtration process , making them the preferred air purifier for patients with breathing disorders.But , even if you do n't  have a breathing disorder and you just want cleaner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical filtration process meaning that a fan pulls the particle-filled air into the unit and forces that air through a HEPA filter , effectively cleaning and circulating the air in a room up to 5 times an hour . <h> Features to Love <p> #1 brand recommended by allergists <p> Helps capture up to 99.97% of microscopic allergens , 0.3 microns and larger from the air that passes through the filter <h> SHOP 170544 @qwx580544 <h> 2 . Humidifier <p> Once you 've been attacked by a cold or seasonal allergies , you may have to take a more defensive approach . A humidifier is often recommended by pediatricians to help infants with their colds and is probably something your mother put in your room when you were congested as a child . <p> Humidifiers create cool vapors to help moisten the air in your room and to help loosen your nasal passage , which is important when you are congested because dry membranes in your nose and throat make passing mucus more difficult . Simply using a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep , or sitting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nasal passages ; allowing you to breathe easier when you are congested . <p> Remember to read the manufacturers instructions ( or check their website if you 've lost the manual ) on how to properly clean your humidifier . Also be sure to change the water regularly . <h> 3 . Neti Pot <p> Neti pots are often mentioned within " alternative medicine " circles , but they have recently gained mainstream use , if you can get over the intimidation and awkwardness of using one . The simple act of flushing your sinuses with warm saline ( similar to saline spray ) can clear your head and bring relief fast . It works well for sinus infections , but also basic colds and allergies anytime your head is congested . Just be sure you are using the proper solution and using the device properly so you do not introduce an infection . <p> Also , be sure to stock up on saline packets to make preparation of the saline solution much easier . Dissolve the contents in warm water in your neti pot . Give a quick stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Neti Pot ? Saline nasal spray or mist can have similar results . Look for one with basic water and salt as ingredients . <h> 4 . Nasal Strips <p> After flushing out your sinuses using the neti pot , continue to breathe easier overnight with the use of nasal strips . These flexible strips adhere to your nose and gently lift the sides of your nose to open your nasal passages giving instant relief . They are great for colds , allergies , and sinus infections . In the morning , just ease them off under warm water during your shower . <p> Nasal strips can also be useful for reducing snoring . <h> 5 . Chest Rub <p> Chest rub is a simple way to get a little help breathing easier when you are congested thanks to the menthol scent , and it can also help ease coughs . For the latter , especially if you are breastfeeding and worried about your infant coming in contact with it , consider applying it to your feet at bedtime . Rub a little onto the soles of your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 6 . Plug-In Vaporizer <p> If you do n't  want to use a chest rub and/or your humidifier is n't designed for the addition of vapor pads or liquid , consider a plug-in style vaporizer . This simple unit holds a pad that releases the vapors into your room . Scents include menthol and lavender , rosemary and eucalyptus . Carefully slip in a single pad , plug in the unit , and let the vapors work their magic while you sleep . <p> If you are sharing a room with your infant post-pregnancy , be sure to read the package labels before using vaporizer pads as most are not recommended for infants under 10 pounds . <p> Finally , remember to continue to drink plenty of water . This is important whether or not you are pregnant or breastfeeding , to keep yourself hydrated as well as to thin your mucus and help to further clear your congestion . Also , be sure to get plenty of rest to help your body heal , and wash your sheets ( especially your pillowcase ! ) frequently to help remove germs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you need to add some maternity clothing to your wardrobe , but do n't  want to spend money on pieces you 'll only wear for a short period of time , then head on over to Melody Lane for the best in regular clothing that is versatile enough to wear before , during , and after pregnancy !

@@58756431 @7756431/ <h> 5 Signs Your Child is Ready to Give Up Naps <p> Sleep . Its one of the things parents think about , talk about and sometimes stress about most . As children get older , they will start to need less and less sleep . Babies drop naps as they get older , bedtimes get pushed back and eventually , sometime during toddlerhood , your child will stop napping completely . - But , how do you know when they are- ready to stop napping ? <p> Biologically speaking , most kids are ready to drop naps around age three . This can vary greatly from child to child , though . Some are ready to stop napping closer to 2 1/2 and others are not ready until they are well over 3 years old . <h> Signs to look for : <h> 1 . Your child starts to fight naps . <p> Whether he physically wont stay in bed , or verbally tells you he does n't  want to take a nap , your child is making it known that he does n't  want to nap anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it takes them a very long time to fall asleep . <p> If your child is in the bed for a long time before falling asleep , your child may not actually need to sleep . Instead , think about starting a daily rest time ( more information on that below ) . <h> 3 . Your child has good energy and a generally consistent mood all day long , even without a nap . <p> In other words , your child can make it from morning till bedtime without becoming overly cranky , fussy or disagreeable they may no longer need a daily nap . However , all toddlers have their moments , so this one is relative . Think about what is normal behavior for your child , and use that as a gauge . <h> 4 . Your child sleeps well at night even without a nap . <p> Remember that old saying " sleep begets sleep ? " Well it is true . If your child does n't  nap , he or she may actually sleep worse at night , not better . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ( approximately 12 hours a night , without frequent , middle of the night wake-ups , and does n't  get up much earlier the next day ) then he or she may be ready to drop the nap . <h> 5 . When the child does take a nap , bedtime becomes more difficult . <p> Maybe bedtime becomes much later or the bedtime routine takes much longer . Maybe your child lays in bed for a long period of time before falling asleep , and thus calls you in several times . Maybe he or she wakes up much earlier in the morning . All of these are signs that the nap may not be working for your child anymore . <p> Experts agree that its not a great idea to quit naps cold turkey and instead suggest weaning from the daily nap . Over a period of a few weeks , or even months , you can slowly begin to shorten the nap , until the child no longer sleeps . <p> During the transition time your child will probably still benefit from a daily rest period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recharge , including Mommy ! <h> Ideas for Daily Rest Time : <p> Create a daily routine that leads up to daily rest time . Much like bedtime routines , daily rest time routines are key to getting your child into the habit of taking a mid-day break . After lunch , have your child get ready for rest time by getting a favorite pillow or stuffed animal and using the potty . No junk food or sugary drinks right before rest time ! <p> Set up a special place for rest time . Ideally , this should be someplace quiet , dimly light , cool , with no enticing toys around. - Make sure your child thinks its a cozy , special place to be . For this reason sleeping bags or play tents can work well ! <p> Consider using white noise , like the ocean or rain , to help your child relax . <p> For older children , consider playing a book on tape or allowing the child to read a stack of books , play with puzzles or do some other quiet , calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys only for rest time . <p> Set a beginning and end so your child knows rest time is a definite period of time . Keep it the same length of time every day . If you put on a calming iPod playlist or a book on tape , when its over , tell the child he or she can get up . <p> Lastly , be prepared to move bedtime earlier by 30 minutes to an hour after naps stop completely . Many children are okay without naps but will require more sleep at night in order to be happy throughout the day . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Krista <p> Krista lives in New York with her husband , their 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son .

The content and opinions expressed below are that of Daily Mom . <p> Our family is one of health and fitness . I am a runner , a yogi , and an avid fitness lover . My husband is an active duty Marine , and fitness is in his daily regime . Frequently our family goes on runs , hikes , and bike rides together . I take my three daughters with me to workout groups and they sit in the jogging stroller on long runs . We love to be active and healthy , and our dog Pendleton is no exception to this . <p> When my husband and I first adopted Pendleton we would take her to the dog park or the dog beach almost every weekend . I would come home during my lunch break during the week and take her on a long walk around the neighborhood or let her play in the field behind our apartment complex . As Pendleton got older and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the outdoors never ceased . But we stopped taking her on our long adventures out because she would become visibly weary , and we did n't  want to exhaust her . This continued for years until recently when we made the switch to Iams quality dog food . <h> Keeping Up with the Family <p> Pendleton is now 8 years old . She is a German Shepard and Sharpei mix which gives her the short stature of the Sharpei but the joint issues of a German Shepard . She has always been energetic and happy , but as with any dog her energy levels have decreased with age . When she sees our family getting ready to go out on an adventure , whether it is a family walk or a run with the double stroller she starts to get herself excited . But over time we have come to learn Pendletons limits , and oftentimes we end up leaving her behind because we fear she wont be able to finish out of exhaustion . <p> When we lived in California I would frequently take Pendleton on runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved being out near the ocean . She would help keep my pace , and I would be her eyes for any seagulls to chase . However , a few babies and a few thousand miles in a cross-country move later it became apparent that our runs would n't be happening as often . I felt bad not being able to give Pendleton the exercise she deserved , but we ended up moving to a large property with a football-sized field for running and woods with lots of squirrels for chasing . Even with a ton of space to run and play , my husband and I could see that Pendleton did n't  enjoy her activities as much as she did before.We attributed this to her old age and our increased family size . We had some other family issues recurrent miscarriages and secondary infertility that stopped me from wanting to workout . Our efforts to keep Pendleton active were put to the wayside , but all that changed a few weeks ago . <h> My Training Partner <p> After our third child was born , with no answers toward our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular fitness routine . There was a half marathon in a few months that I had missed the past two years due to pregnancy , and it was my goal to be able to run it . I started myself off slowly as I was postpartum , but soon my strength training and running schedule were engrained into my days . I would often do shorter training runs while my oldest was at preschool or around our neighborhood during my younger two childrens nap times . When Pendleton would see me lace up my running shoes , she would get herself excited to come outside with me , but I often found myself telling her " No , not today . I do n't  think you can run that long . " She would slink back to her doggie bed as I walked out the door , either by myself or with the girls , feeling left behind . <p> A few weeks after making the switch to Iams , we began to notice Pendletons increased energy levels . First we saw her behavior as she played with the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few days later , I decided to take the girls for a hike on a nearby trail and this time I took Pendleton with us . She had a blast , and her energy levels were so much better now that she was on her new dog food . I was beyond impressed , but I still was n't sure her age would allow me to take her on any training runs . <p> It was the weekend , and I decided to do a couple laps around the neighborhood while my husband sat at home with the girls . No double stroller to push , so this time I wanted to try to increase my pace for race day . My husband suggested I take Pendleton with me . I was hesitant but since we would be close to home I decided it was ok I could always drop her back if she became too exhausted . It was four miles , and our neighborhood was hilly . She had n't  continually run this long in years , and now she was much older . I started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly . Much to my surprise , Pendleton kept up with me the entire time ! She did n't  slow down my pace except to make a couple of pit stops . At first I watched her intently for signs of exhaustion , but after awhile I did n't  even think about her being by my side except to think of how nice it was to have my training partner back with me . <p> After that , Pendleton went on every short training run with me until my half marathon , which I met with a goal of a sub-two hour race . Im convinced that having her by my side helped me stay consistent with my training pace and helped me reach my goal . <p> We are beyond thrilled to have made the switch to Iams for Pendleton . As a fit and active family , its important to have her join us when we are out and about . The Iams Visible Differences that we have noticed in her from her shinier coat and increased energy levels has been significant .

@@58756434 @7756434/ <h> What Your Kids Should be Wearing : Under Where ? Underwear ! <p> This summer , our kids enjoyed endless days of swimsuits and naked booties . Unfortunately , those days are over . The summer heat will soon be a distant memory and cooler temperatures will be just around the corner . Of course , this means its time to switch out seasonal wardrobes . Chances are that you 've already thought about the most obvious clothing related purchases ( tops , bottoms , jackets , shoes , etc. ) that your child may have outgrown , but have you given much thought to what your kids are wearing under their new threads ? <p> Whether your kids are going back to school or not , undergarments play an important role in a childs wardrobe for several reasons . Today were looking at the top 4 reasons you need to pay attention to what your kids should be wearing with regard to underwear . <h> 1 . Keep that Core Warm <p> Once upon a time , doctors recommended that children should wear an undershirt of some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , that recommendation may need to be adjusted by a month or two ( or thrown out completely if you live in Florida ) , but the premise is that as it gets colder , you should give your kids an extra layer of warmth . <p> This recommendation begins the moment your child is born as their circulation is not yet developed . Just use a simple undershirt ( you probably received at least a few onesies during your baby shower ) to keep warmth in , so that even while you are changing a diaper or their outfit , their middle is covered . <p> Even if you 're hot , be sure to check your babys extremities . If their hands or feet are purple , you can effectively assume that your baby is NOT warm ! With that said , use some common sense . There 's no sense in overdressing your infant either . Just as purple limbs would indicate cold , red or pink skin ( and a lot of fussiness ) often means they are too hot . <h> 2 . Layering <p> Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc ) should continue wearing an undershirt . The key reason being that as children get older , they become more responsible for dressing themselves . Kids typically ca n't plan ahead . Therefore , an unsupervised child might put on a sweatshirt over his bare skin to warm up in the morning . However , as the day heats up , he will just take it off . While nakedness is adorable as a baby , young children should have some clothes on ( even if its just a t-shirt and underwear ) , especially if they are of school age . <p> Its our responsibility as parents to help our children understand how to dress appropriately.This means putting away summer clothing during cold months and helping our children understand that an undershirt is a foundational layer that should n't be removed unless you are swimming or bathing . <p> Closed-toe shoes ( especially important while playing on the playground ) <p> Hat and gloves ( if its cold enough ) <p> Dressing in layers allows your child to remove a layer if they get too hot , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with . <h> 3 . Modesty <p> Many girls seem to hit a phase where they only want to wear dresses . While this can certainly save time at the potty , it can lead to embarrassment when a little boy in their class points out that he can see her underwear ! And while we are all for encouraging our little girls to be just as active as little boys ; they should not have to compromise their femininity or modesty in the process . <p> Much like the recommendation of a camisole or undershirt has been ignored in recent years , when many little girls wear dresses , basic undergarments are forgotten . Sure your daughter can look like a well-dressed baby doll while she 's standing or sitting still , but what happens when she decides to act her age and play ? <p> Therefore , one of the most important things you can do for your little girl is to teach her how to wear the proper accessories with her favorite dress.Historically , girls ( and women ) wore bloomers ( or pantaloons ) under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many girls prefer to wear some sort of short ( boy shorts , biker shorts , etc . ) . <p> Better than bloomers , Hide-ees are an ingenius solution for moms with little girls who just cant sit still . Made of a cotton/spandex blend , active girls and tweens ( size 2 to 12 , up to a ladies large ) can wear Hide-ees shorts under dresses , skirts , uniforms , tutus and anything where a tiny bit of extra coverage is needed . <p> Solid color Hide-ees with a sweet ruffle are available in many different colors ( and color combinations ) , so that when your daughter puts on a dress , she can just add a pair of matching or coordinating shorts and go ! Or , if you have a school/sport uniform or an older daughter who prefers a more mature look , Hide-ees without a ruffle are also available . <h> SHOP 170544 @qwx580544 <h> 4 . Prevent Sexual Abuse <p> While we are in the process of training our kids to wear proper undergarments for the sake of modesty or keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the dangers of sexual abuse.We can prevent sexual abuse by properly dressing our children and having a few crucial conversations . <h> Anything that is covered by underwear is private . <p> No one should ask to see or touch parts of the body covered by underwear or undershirts . In fact , most preschools insist that children over the age of 3 must be potty trained so that teachers and students are not put into a situation where sexual abuse could occur ( not that we would ever suggest that a preschool teacher would abuse one of our children , but it could happen ) . <p> Furthermore , no one should ask your child to touch or look at parts of their body covered by underwear . Teach your child that if anyone suggests such a thing , that they should say no . This includes other kids their age . While " playing doctor " is innocent enough at 2 years old , be careful about how your kids are " exploring " as they get older . Sexual abuse can occur between peers , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Teach boys and girls not to " show off " parts of their body covered by underwear . In particular , boys should not play with their genitals in public . <p> In some situations , such as mom and dad during bath time , or doctors and nurses during a check up , may need to touch your child 's private parts . Explain that while these situations are ok , the child should always be asked for permission first . <h> Your childs body belongs to them , and no one else . <p> No one has the right to make your child do anything with their body that makes them feel uncomfortable . <p> Your child always has the right to say no ' when they are uncomfortable , even to a family member or someone they love . <p> Teach your child that they are in control of their body and their feelings are respected .

You 're not alone ! <p> Toddlers are some of our favorite groups of people to photograph . These tiny humans are so cute and always seem to be doing something worthy of being captured on " film . " Unfortunately , these brilliant people have a nasty reputation of running away when they see a camera , or jumping up from their seat just as you 've asked them to sit down , or looking anywhere BUT into the camera when you 're most ready to click the shutter . <p> Today 's tips may not prevent your child from running away at the sight of a camera , but with any luck , they may just stay still long enough to capture a smile . Without further ado , we present to you our top five tips for getting your toddler to sit still and look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you have any chance of getting your toddler to sit still and look at the camera , it starts with giving your toddler a place to sit . This is even more important if you have a younger toddler , you know , one who has recently learned to walk and wants to walk any chance they get . <p> If you 're trying to chase an active toddler , you 'll spend more time trying to focus and miss the smiles . However , if you provide a place for that child to sit , you can spend more of your time shooting . If you 're not sure what to use as a seat , look for a good stool , bench , stump , chair , rocking horse or their favorite riding toy . You can even use a piece of tape or a sticker on the floor and ask them to sit on that spot . You 'll receive bonus points if they can have fun while you 're taking pictures . <p> That said , be sure to have your camera out and your settings ready BEFORE you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seated , they will only sit still for a moment or two , so you have to be ready . Furthermore , if you can have an assistant to wrangle your child , or stand behind you and act like a goofball , you 'll have an even better chance of getting the shot you want . <h> 2 . Something to Hold <p> If simply sitting down is n't enough to keep your toddler in place long enough to get a good shot , try giving them something to hold onto . <p> Bring along their favorite stuffed animal ( or another small toy ) for a sentimental touch . Alternatively , you can share some sweet treats ( something that wont make a mess of their clothing or face , such as a smartie ) . You can even grab a nearby flower , as we did in the shot above . Simply have your child sit down and then hand them the toy or treat . Be prepared with your camera , but allow them a little bit of time to explore whatever it is that you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera ready ) for the moment when your child looks back at you . Their expression will be worth the wait ! <h> 3 . Look HERE ! <p> Isnt it funny how toddlers always want us to watch what they 're doing , but refuse to look at us when they see a camera ? <p> If you do n't  have an extra set of hands , you 'll have to get creative . We like to wear a ridiculous headband or hat on our head . You can then ask your child , " what 's on my head . " Keep asking until they look up . Ideally , theyll laugh or smile . We 've also found it fun to sing songs and change the words to something super silly , or ask what a lion says , then moo ( or something along those lines ) . Try doing something a little unexpected and your toddler is sure to follow along . <p> You can also use something like a Shutter Huggerthat is designed to give your child something fun to look at , but we have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lose their effectiveness . However , we 've found that sometimes , simply moving around a bit ( standing up , sitting down , leaning one way or another ) will draw your toddlers eyes towards you . At some point during their curiosity , you 're bound to catch them looking your way . <h> 4 . Show Them Your Screen <p> Some of our favorites photo sessions with our toddlers , have been when we loosened up and allowed them to take part in the " design " of the photo shoot . <p> Okay , so we realize that you are n't  always trying to recreate an image from pinterest when you pick up your camera . However , that does n't  mean we do n't  subconsciously try to guide our children into doing something specific for the sake of a picture . Our kids sense this and will try everything in their little power to find out what it is that were so desperately trying to achieve . As far as they are concerned , if they just get a look into our viewfinder , theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show them . <p> That 's right , let them see themselves inside the camera by showing them your LCD screen.This simple exercise will delight your child , and if they are anything like our children , theyll want to do it again . We 've found that overtime , your child may even start asking you to take their picture with the understanding that you show them the picture immediately after . It may not always be what you were hoping to get out of the photo shoot , but you 'll have fun doing it . <h> 5 . Monkey See , Monkey Do <p> If you have an older toddler ( 2 or 3 years old ) , you may have good luck asking your child to do something specific such as sit here , lie down or pose , but only after you perform the task first . <p> We find that this approach works best if you and your toddler are already in the mood for photos . You can try something kinda silly to start . As he mimics you , be sure to praise him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as you keep telling your child that they 're doing a great job , theyll play along for as long as you 'd like ( at least a few poses ) . <p> With a little practice and a lot of patience , we hope that these tips better prepare you to take photos of your adorable toddlers . Sitting still and looking at the camera is half the battle , but if you can overcome that much , the rest is super fun ! 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Ashley Sisk <p> Ashley lives in North Carolina with her husband , two children and Kitty Paw .

Unfortunately many of us also fail to take advantage of our paid membership which results in frustration and wasted money month after month . When you 're looking for a gym , its important to join one that has the things you 're looking for in a gym and- a gym that will keep you engaged throughout your fitness journey . <p> If you 're looking for an affordable gym with a ton of perks to help get you started , then Planet Fitness is the gym for you . With affordable monthly payments and two different plans to choose from on top of FREE personal training , a 30 minute circuit , massage beds , tanning beds and locker rooms with showers , youre- sure to fall in love with Planet Fitness . <p> Here are 5 ways to get the most out of your Planet Fitness Membership . <h> Would rather work out at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> First , its important to understand that Planet Fitness offers two memberships that you can choose from. - Whether you 're looking for a package that includes the bare minimum or a membership package that includes it all , one of the- memberships is sure to work for you , your budget and your fitness goals . They offer the- No Commitment- Membership- and Black Card Membership . If you 're looking to make some serious changes , both options offer great benefits , but the Black Card Membership offers a few benefits that are worth the extra $9.99 . <p> No Commitment Memberships are ideal for potential members who are seeking the bare minimum . They 're not interested in the extra perks that the Black Card has to offer . They plan on visiting the same gym and possibly may add in the free fitness training . <p> Black Card Memberships are ideal for those potential members who want it all . Not only do they get the free t-shirt and unlimited fitness training , but they also get access to any franchise Planet Fitness location , unlimited use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks as well as additional perks . <h> 1 . Free Fitness- Training <p> Fitness training can be costly and because of that it can deter those that are really trying to get in shape from pursuing it . At Planet Fitness , fitness training is free . You can choose to work one-on-one with a trainer , or you can join a group of individuals in group training sessions . Either way , the personal trainer will work with you to accomplish your goals all while motivating you and developing a fitness plan suitable to you . <p> Here are three benefits- to working out in small groups : <p> You get to be part of a group : Its more fun to work out as part of a group than by yourself because those involved in the group may have similar fitness goals and similar hurdles to overcome . Additionally , the encouragement and support you gain from being part of the group fitness team- is something that ca n't be matched . <p> You gain motivation while having fun : - Its natural that when working out alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit in you . Not only does this serve as a great motivational tool to push you harder , longer and further , but when those challenges and goals are met , you share in the accomplishments with your team . It creates a sense of camaraderie which creates a fun environment for all those participating . <p> Accountability : - When you work out by yourself , there is no one to hold you accountable . The treadmill wont know that you 've skipped your night routine , but when you are in a group , theyll help hold you accountable and keep you motivated . When you 're having a difficult time and start skipping classes , your group members will encourage you to get back into it ! Oftentimes those that venture out to accomplish their fitness goals every January drop out after a few weeks because of the lack of accountability . <p> If you 're looking for a way to jump-start your fitness routine , stay motivated , and make friends along the way , then small group training is something to really consider ! <h> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule , you now have zero excuses about not making it to the gym . Planet Fitness is open 24 hours a day ! This is a huge incentive for those- individuals whose schedule is unpredictable . Unlike other 24 hour gyms , there will be staff there to greet you and answer any questions you might have . Plus , their tanning and massage beds are also working around the clock . If you invest in the black card membership , remember that you 're able to stop into any Planet Fitness franchise location . As you can tell , there are plenty of options . In fact , there are over 1,000 locations throughout the United States , 6 in Ontario , Canada , 5 in Puerto Rico and one in the Dominican Republic . <h> 3 . No Intimidation Zone/Judgement Free Zone <p> Planet Fitness is well known for making their members feel comfortable by minimizing intimidation and judgement . They have a- lunk alarm that goes off when someone drops a weight or if someone is acting like a lunk . The club defines a lunk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricky is slamming his weights , wearing a body building tank top and drinking out of a water jug what a lunk ! ) . - Planet Fitness truly makes it their mission to ensure their members feel comfortable , and they have been known to ask individuals to leave the club for judging or intimidating other members . Everyone should feel comfortable in their gym as they- take on- their fitness journey head-on . <h> 4 . Tanning , Massage and Locker Room <p> Planet Fitness offers nice locker rooms for their members convenience . Showers , changing rooms and lockers are provided to ensure the safety of members items , privacy while changing and showers to help get them cleaned up following their workout . For Black Card Members , they have the hydromassage bed and seated massage chair at their disposal . Having the option of these massages are perfect after a tough workout ! Though these massages may not be as great as hands-on massages through a massage therapist , they are much more cost-effective , included in the $19.99 Black Card Membership monthly membership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitness also offers a 30 minute circuit for their members to follow. - Its a great system they offer to those who are pressed for time but want to achieve a solid workout . <p> What is the 30 Minute Circuit ? The 30 minute circuit is a 20 station circuit that takes 30 minutes to complete . Odd numbered stations are the machines whereas the even numbered stations are step boxes . They use red and green lights similar to a traffic signal to indicate when you need to be starting and completing the set . The green light cycle lasts for a minute and the red light cycle lasts for 30 seconds . How does the 30 Minute Circuit Work ? When you 're in the circuit , its important to keep an eye on the light changes for when the signal changes from red to green . If you do n't  complete the rep , you should still move on to the next station . When you 're at a step box station you move the entire minute and when the light begins flashing it means that the cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump into the 30 minute circuit at any machine , its important that you follow them in order . Is the 30 Minute Circuit a good work out ? Its a good workout for the amount allotted to it , but just like any other workout , you are only going to get out of it what you put into it . For instance , if you make your way through the circuit with weight that is n't challenging you , then you 're not getting the most out of the workout . If you 're not moving the entire time at the stepping stations , you 're not challenging yourself enough . Continuously challenge yourself by adding in high knees , kicks or side steps into the stepping stations . Planet Fitness also provides alternative moves you can engage in at the stepping stations . <p> Planet Fitness also has a separate room specifically designed for ab workout concentration and stretching . This room allows members to focus on abs by providing floor mats , free weights and ab machines . Stretching machines are also located in this area as well as mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Would rather work out at home ? <p> Build a home gym with these recommended equipment : <p> For other tips on fitness and healthy eating , make sure that you 're following our Get Fit Initiative ! 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Danielle Jones <p> Danielle resides in the Mitten State with her husband , toddler son and two loving pit-bull dogs .

@@58756443 @7756443/ <h> Encouraging Cognitive Development Through Arts and Crafts <p> If you hear the words arts and crafts , and shudder , you are n't  alone . Many a mother cowers in horror when imagining letting their little darlings loose with glue , construction paper , markers , popsicle sticks , scissors , and ( gasp ) glitter.Well , were here to ease your fears . Although craft time can be a bit messy , it is extremely beneficial for your childs brain ; especially for their cognitive development . Curious as to how covering themselves in paste helps your child learn ? Read on . <p> First off , we need to mention Richard Rende , Ph.D . Havent heard of him ? He is a developmental psychologist whose main area of study is the link between parenting practices , family interaction , and emotional behavioral development . According to Rende , children benefit greatly from arts and crafts time especially when it is with their parents . <p> Today well look at just some of the benefits of encouraging cognitive development through arts and crafts . <h> Bilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you they are engaging their brains in many different areas at one time , improving their ability to use bilateral coordination . What is that , you ask ? Bilateral coordination is when your child is able to use both sides of their bodies at the same time in a controlled and organized manner . When your child is doing an exercise such as touching their left hand to their right foot , that is bilateral coordination . Why is this important ? If your child can easily use bilateral coordination without much trouble that means that both sides of his brain are working in harmony , communicating and sharing information . <h> Visual Processing Skills <p> While crafting with you , your child will also hone in their visual processing skills by manipulating different materials . This set of skills includes recognizing patterns , the ability to sequence , and being able to use spatial rotation ( the ability to rotate images in ones mind ) such as when you need to figure out how to rotate a puzzle piece so that it will fit . These skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <h> Executive Function <p> Is craft time stressful ? Does your child grab the scissors and glue and start cutting and pasting like a madman ? Believe it or not , this is a good thing . When you encourage your children to use their materials more independently you are helping them develop executive functioning skills . Executive function is used to describe the processes that your childs mind goes through when they are problem solving and planning/executing tasks . This wo n't only have an impact on success in school , but in the business world as well . So , next time you flinch when you see a land mine of craft materials start to fly , relax and know your child is learning and their minds are growing ! <h> Fine Motor Skills <p> While fine motor skills , the working of the muscles in the fingers and hands , may not seem like it has an effect on cognition , it does . Let 's say you ask your child to cut out a triangle with a pair of scissors ; you are not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to follow the lines with their scissors . Their brain also must send signals to their hands to move the scissor handles up and down . <p> Its amazing how everything goes back to the brain , even gross and fine motor skills . Now that you know what arts and crafts time does for your childs brain and cognitive development you can try this cute back to school apple craft ! <h> DIY Apple Craft for Preschoolers <h> 1 . Gather your supplies . <p> You will need a piece each of white , green , and red paper as well as a pair of child-safe scissors , glue , and a marker . <h> 2 . Fold the white piece of paper long ways . <p> Hot dog style for those of us still in our elementary school days , and draw the shape of half an apple ( make a heart shape until you get to the bottom and round it off ) . <h> 3 . Have your child cut out the shape . <p> If your child is younger you will need to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child has the apple shape cut out set it aside and give them the red and green paper to rip apart . This will probably be their favorite part ! <h> 5 . Time to Glue . <p> Next , hand over the glue and let them go wild ! Have your child cover the entire apple shape in white liquid glue . Stick glue will work , but liquid glue is a lot more fun for them and works those little hand muscles ! <h> 6 . Let Dry and Proudly Display ! <p> Last , have your child sprinkle the ripped up green and red paper on the apple shape that is now covered in a plethora of glue . Let it dry and proudly display ! <h> Daily Mom Recommendation <p> Once your child is ready to make that leap , consider checking out Childtime . Childtime is truly nurturing in every way . Its not just any kind of daycare ; they make it feel like home . Its a warm and inviting place where children get the nurturing they need to develop and grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Childtime , and your child will learn to discover and explore the world around them , based on their individual interests . <p> As a parent , you will feel confident and secure that your child is in an enriching environment at Childtime , and they will be treated with the same love and respect that they receive at home . <p> This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Learning Care Group .

@@58756445 @7756445/ <h> Tandem Breastfeeding : The First Weeks <p> Currently , two members of the Daily Mom team are in the midst of tandem breastfeeding . After a lot of trial and error , a few tears , and many snuggles with our little ones , we realized that everyone should know about the products and resources that helped us during our first few weeks of tandem breastfeeding . <p> Compared to the nearly endless books and resources on breastfeeding in general , there really is n't that much information out there concerning tandem breastfeeding . This can leave mothers hoping to tandem breastfeed at a bit of a loss . Nursing two children of different ages has great positive aspects , but as you may suspect , its own set of challenges . We found it helpful to have others to talk to and share experiences with . <h> For Mom : <p> Tandem breastfeeding is like the making of a diamondit takes time and effort , but the results are worth it ! Breastfeeding two children takes patience and endurance , so to help you along , here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Yes , we know you get tired of the taste , but mix it up by infusing it with some mint or fruit . You can also make some iced ( or hot ) lactation tea or other herbal teas which do not interfere with breastfeeding . <p> Lactation Supplements <p> Oats , Fenugreek , Goats Rue , and Brewers Yeast are a few of the many lactation supplements that can increase the quality and volume of your milk supply . Implementing these into your diet can help sustain a thirsty toddler alongside a newborn . <p> Chances are if you decide to nurse both children at the same time , or even just sequentially , your arms are going to get tired . Nursing pillows , such as this one by My Breast Friend , can really help tired arms and will help keep your back straight . <p> Nursing Aversion <p> You may be dealing with a nursing aversion when it feels unpleasant to nurse your older child . These feelings can wax and wane , and they may not ever completely subside . In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , as well as to think about something else or focus on how beneficial nursing is from your toddlers point of view . <p> Prepare Yourself for the Possibility of More Plugged Ducts <p> Drinking lots of water will help with this , but with all of the milk you are producing plugged ducts are more likely to occur ( and as we have noticed , particularly at night ) . <p> If you struggle with clogged ducts , a trick for the night time is to be sure to nurse your toddler on both sides . Your toddler can relieve engorgement faster than your newborn . Even if it may be tempting to ask a toddler to wait until the morning , it may help you in the long run to have them nurse . <p> The " What am I doing ? " Moment <p> Do n't  worry , you are not the first person to feel overwhelmed ! With both children up at night , you may feel like you are constantly topless and smell like milk . You may plan for an hour just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tasks suddenly feel insurmountable . You may even cry . We did . But remember you are not alone . Try to find out about a Le Leche League ( LLL ) group or other Mothers group in your area . Talk to a lactation consultant for more positioning tips and overall guidance , if necessary . <p> Cut Yourself Some Slack <p> We are not going to sugarcoat it : the first few weeks ( or months ) of tandem nursing can be hard ! Do n't  put pressure on yourself to get a lot of other things done around the house . Breastfeeding two children can also be exhausting , so try to take a nap when possible , or at least lie down . <p> Relaxed Breastfeeding <p> If you decide to nurse both children at once , try breastfeeding in the " relaxed " position . Lean back on a few pillows and support your arms with pillows , too . <p> Enjoy the Snuggles <p> Even if your toddler becomes more clingy , try to see the positives : you are allowing your older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra comforting to them . So even if you are " touched out " by the end of the day , still try to enjoy the snuggles . Remember the bonds you are building : not only the bond between you and each of them , but their bond with each other , too . <p> Listen to Your Heart <p> As with breastfeeding in public or extended breastfeeding , you may receive unsolicited advice and comments . Just remember that you really are a super mom just by choosing to undertake breastfeeding two . Some of the best advice we can give is to follow your own instincts . You know your children and you know yourself . <h> For Your Infant : <p> Skin to Skin <p> Be sure to remember the importance of skin to skin . Include your toddler and Daddy , too , while you are at it ! This not only helps your baby but can boost your oxytocin and your milk supply as well ! Ask your toddler to count the babys little fingers and toes , hold hands , and give little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of being together . <p> Who Nurses First ? <p> Discover a nursing groove that helps both children . Nurse one child on each side or alternating sides . A helpful hint is to allow your older child to nurse first at night , or if it has been a while since the last feeding . That cuts down on the " fire hose " effect , which can frustrate your newborn so much . <h> For Your Toddler : <p> Let Them Help You <p> Ask your toddler to help you by nursing to curb your engorgement . Your toddler will be more than happy to help you and to help the baby , too . <p> You can also ask them to do other small tasks which involves them such as getting your water or helping you with a pillow . <p> Encourage Positive Older Sibling Behavior : <p> Let your toddler discover all of the characteristics and needs of their new sibling . If you choose to only nurse one child at a time , then ask you toddler to point out the babys features while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing for the baby or to put a blanket over the baby . The key is to involve them even when it is not their turn to nurse . <p> Another option is to have activities lined up for your toddler while you nurse your newborn . Consider Motessori activities , puzzles , or a few books to readsomething to keep your toddler engaged while you make time for just you and your infant . <p> Overall , we can not say tandem nursing is an easy endeavorespecially in the first weeksbut there are some amazing benefits and we encourage any mom who is thinking about or starting to tandem nurse to not give up !

Or have you been using a DSLR for a while now , but only in auto mode ? Either way , using a DSLR camera can be quite overwhelming , especially with all the new buttons . That said , you 're probably here today because you own a Canon DSLR and youre- hopeful that you 'll learn a thing or two- about taking better photos of your child ( if you own a Nikon DSLR , look for the Nikon version of this post coming soon ) . <p> Well , hang on tight ! This summer , were going to take you step by step into the world of digital photography . Our goal is- that you are taking photos of your children in manual mode by Labor Day . Sound good ? <p> Alright then , let 's start with the very basics buttons ! <h> Canon DSLR Front <p> This is the front of a Canon Rebel XSi . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may own- something similar to the- Canon Rebel T3i instead . The buttons are going to be relatively the same ( with a few additional features on upper end cameras ) . If you are n't  sure , pull out your cameras manual. - <p> Lens Mount and Lens Mount Index- ( red dot ) . Every lens has a similar red dot that is meant to match up with the red dot on your camera body . It allows you to align , twist and click the lens into place . You 'll know your lens is secured once you hear the click . <p> Flash Button. - Press this button to activate your pop-up flash . When you 're in full auto mode , your camera will decide whether or not to use the flash . However , if you want to manually decide to use your on-board flash ( ex. fill flash ) , this button can be useful . <p> Depth of Field Preview Button. - - The depth of field determines how much of an image is in focus . For example , if you took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both the subject- and- the mountain range are in focus , you have deep or large depth of field . If the subject is in focus but the mountains are- blurred , you have shallow or small depth of field . This button will close the aperture to give you an idea ( through the viewfinder ) of what will be in focus . <p> Lens Contacts . These points will line up with the contacts of compatible lenses that allow for your cameras auto focusing and other settings to work seamlessly . <p> Mirror. - The- mirror allows you to see , through your- viewfinder , almost- exactly- what you will photograph by reflecting the image up , and into the eyepiece . It is activated the moment you press the shutter release and will return to its original place once the photo is taken . DO NOT TOUCH THE MIRROR WITH YOUR FINGERS.Also , you should only use special cleaning solutions and equipment to clean it . If you spot any dust on your mirror , do n't  mess with it . Any dust on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone . <p> Grip . Usually rubberized , the grip makes it a little easier to hold your camera . Its often best to hold a potential camera with the grip before making a camera purchase so you can get a feel for how the DSLR fits in your hands . <p> Shutter Button. - This is how you take a picture . But did you know that by pressing it halfway down , you will start the auto focus and exposure calculations ? Press halfway down to establish your settings , then press all the way down to take a photo . <p> Remote Control Sensor. - This sensor is- used- as an indicator for the self timer function with a flash and beep during the delay . <p> Pop-Up Flash . Most " prosumer " DSLRs have a built-in flash that will activate in full auto as the camera thinks required . Try to avoid using your on-board flash . <h> Canon DSLR- Back <p> Viewfinder. - - Unlike your old point and shoot camera , you actually have to look into the viewfinder to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LCD screen ( or a flip-out screen ) , but its just as easy to look through the viewfinder . When you look inside , you 'll be able to see your focal points , your histogram , ISO , aperture and shutter speed settings ( all of which- well talk about in future- articles ) . <p> Dioptric Adjustment. - Tucked in behind the rubber eyecup , the small dioptric adjustment dial is easily overlooked. - Dioptric adjustment allows for fine-tuning of the viewfinder focus to- meet an individual 's eyes . If adjusted correctly , a person who normally wears glasses or contacts , would n't need to while using their camera. - <p> Rubber Eyecup. - If you wear glasses , the rubber eyecup- protects the lenses from scratching against the camera . Without glasses , it- allows- the viewfinder to form- around your eye and eliminate any surrounding glare . <p> Exposure Lock/Zoom Button. - This button serves 2 purposes . A ) Exposure Lock Button : aim the camera at your subject and press this button . It will record and keep ( for a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't  work once you manually adjust your settings , but you 're probably shooting in auto mode right now , so it might still be useful for you . B ) When using the image preview screen to look at your exposed images , this button will zoom in on a specific area . <p> Focus Point Selector/Zoom Button. - This button also has 2 purposes . A ) Auto Focus Point Selector:you can choose from a number of points as to which you would like to use . If you auto select , the camera will automatically select- the best focal point for the shot . B ) When reviewing your images on the screen , this will zoom out of a specific area . <p> Aperture/Exposure Compensation Button. - This is another button that has 2 functions . A ) Aperture Selector : to set the aperture , hold down this button and turn the dial to the preferred aperture . B ) Exposure Compensation : used to alter the standard exposure set by the camera .

@@58756449 @7756449/ <h> Teach Your Kids Fire Prevention and Safety <p> Fires occur at all times of the day and night and they do not discriminate between socioeconomic class and status . They sometimes strike without warning or reason , so the best way to prevent fires in your home is to teach your children about why fires may happen and emphasize how dangerous and sometimes deadly they can be . Instead of lecturing your children about fire prevention and safety , get them interactive in learning through activities and conversation . <p> Here are some tips to teaching your kids about fire prevention and safety . <h> 1 . Have conversations with your children <p> In every household , children should be educated about fire prevention and safety . These conversations should entail common and uncommon ways that fires take place . Emphasize to your children that leaving flammable objects such as newspaper and plastic on top of a gas stove or playing with lighters are very common ways that fires can occur . Explain to them that exposed wires and using extension cords are somewhat uncommon causes of fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 30,000 are injured in fires . Many of those could have been prevented through education . <p> Fire travels fast ! In less than 30 seconds , a small flame can spread into an out-of-control fire . It takes only a few minutes for thick black smoke to fill a home . <p> Fire is hot ! The temperature of fire at floor level can be a hundred degrees and rise to above 600- at eye level . Because of this extreme heat , breathing it can scorch your lungs . <p> Fire is dark ! When a fire starts , its initially bright but as it produces smoke it can cause complete darkness . If you wake up during a fire you may be partially blind , disoriented , and unable to find a way to get out . <p> Fire is deadly ! More people die from smoke and toxic gases than flames . Because fire uses the oxygen you need and produces smoke and toxic gases , it can become deadly within minutes . <h> 2 . Develop an Escape Plan <p> You should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape plan should be routinely practiced and organized until it becomes a well-known routine.Once you develop an escape plan , make sure its a clear path . That way in case of an emergency , you 're not slowed down by moving things out of the way . Children should have an understanding of what they need to do in case a fire occurs . These routines and plans should include unexpected areas and backup plans in case a fire starts in places that were not rehearsed . In case a backup plan needs to go into effect , continue practicing it routinely and quiz your children frequently so that they are prepared if and when the time occurs . If your child is staying at a family member or friends house , make sure you find out if a fire escape plan is in place . <p> The National Fire Protection Association has created a great How to Guide for creating a fire escape plan . It outlines step by step how to create it and its a great activity to get your kids involved in. <h> 3 . Discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire extinguishers in every room will ensure that individuals are not only alerted of the emergency but that they have a battling tool they can utilize if need be . Smoke detectors should be placed in rooms where there are appliances or other applications known to cause fires . Make sure that smoke detectors are outside every bedroom and in the hallways . And instill in your children the importance of having such tools in your house . Its always a wise idea to have backup batteries for fire detectors on hand at all times . If there 's no escape route or fire extinguisher available , children should be taught how to dial 911 by using a touch-tone phone . <p> Earlier this year , two engineering college students at George Mason University created a fire extinguisher that puts out flames by sound waves . This unique idea is the first of its kind that does not use foam , powder or water but rather waves that are produced by low-frequency sound waves . This concept is based on the way that sound waves displace oxygen as it travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extinguish a small controlled fire which was created by an alcohol accelerant . Though this new technology is under further testing , it could change how we look at fire safety . <h> 4 . Stop , Drop and Roll <p> The idea of stop , drop and roll has been something we have been taught since we were little kids , and this same technique exists even today . Parents do n't  want to have to think of the scenario where their child is on fire , but we must teach them the right maneuver of how to stay calm and stop the fire by rolling on the ground . Its also a smart idea to teach your child about types and degrees of burns and how to treat them . <h> Types of Burns <p> First Degree Burns cause minimal skin damage . They 're also referred to as " superficial burns " because they typically affect the outermost layer of skin . <p> Treatment : These types of burns can usually be treated at home . Run cool water over the affected area for five minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or antibiotic ointment to the area and cover with loose gauze to protect the area . <p> Second Degree Burns are more serious and the damage to the skin extends beyond the top layer of skin . These burns can cause the affected area to blister and become extremely sore . <p> Signs and Symptoms : blisters , redness and extreme soreness of the affected area <p> Treatment : These types of burns can also be treated at home , except on rare occasions if the area gets infected . Run the burned area under water for a minimum of 15 minutes , take over-the-counter medicine for pain and generously apply antibiotic cream on blisters . If the burns affects a widespread area of the face , hands , buttocks , groin or feet , seek emergency treatment . <p> Third Degree Burns are the worst burns and cause the most damage because they extend through every layer of skin . Such damage can reach the bloodstream , major organs and bones which could ultimately lead to death . <p> Signs and Symptoms : With the extent of damage this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received this type of burn may not feel pain because the nerves are severely damaged . These types of burns look waxy and white , charred , dark brown or raised and leathery . <p> Treatment : With this type of burn , one should never attempt to self-treat a third-degree burn . Call 911 immediately and while you 're waiting for help , its important to raise the burned area above your heart . There is no timeline of how quickly a third-degree burn heals . <p> Teaching your children about fire safety and prevention should be considered a top priority in every household . These fire prevention and safety tips are designed to help you talk to your children in a non-threatening manner about the potential dangers of fire and the effects it has on them and the home . Practicing these safety tips routinely can mean the difference between life and death . 170550 @qwx580550 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Danielle Jones <p> Danielle resides in the Mitten State with her husband , toddler son and two loving pit-bull dogs .

Start the weekend watching old Peanut themed movies <p> Not only will adults love revisiting the classics they grew up on , but this is a great way to introduce your little " peanuts " to the characters of the film .

Get Movie Snacks <p> Take a trip to Sams Club together and pick up family-size packages of Tyson Chicken Nuggets and Crispy Strips . Below are some fun recipes ( some of them Peanuts themed ) to enjoy while watching the movies . <h> 4 . Prepare Snacks Together <p> Before you watch the movies , get the kids involved in the preparation of food for the Peanuts marathon . Not only is this a valuable lesson in helping out , but cooking together is a great " pre-gamer " for movies . Children are more willing to help because they are excited about the end result of the preparations : lots of food eaten in the living room while watching a movie not something parents normally allow ! <h> 5 .

Cut two small eye holes in mozzarella cheese and lay over the nugget . Heat nuggets for an additional 3 minutes or until the cheese is melted . <h> FOR THE ADULTS : <p> Parents like to eat too , so we came up with an alternative recipe for the adults with a more sophisticated palate . <h> Chicken &amp; Avocado Croissant Sandwiches <p> There are several options and variations on this recipe , so you can be as creative as you 'd like ! <p> What you 'll need : <p> Croissants <p> Spring Mix <p> Avocado or Guacamole <p> Tyson Crispy Chicken Strips cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Within seconds , the screaming begins and no amount of shushing , pacing , or rocking is helping . <p> Interestingly enough , you recognize that feeding your baby causes him to be even more unsettled . He s got to be hungry , but his reflux is terrible ; and to suggest that he has an upset stomach is the understatement of the year ! And the diapers ? WOW ! Besides being runny , they make you want to dress up as if you were conducting some sort of chemistry experiment goggles included ! That gorgeous little face has a terrible rash and it seems that its just getting worse . Youve been to the doctor countless times , but its always brushed off as baby eczema and they send you on your way . <p> But something is n't right . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your once happy baby who slept well and was growing at a rapid rate ? That same baby is now crying non-stop ( unless they are being held all-night-long ) and you 're losing your mind . While its certainly possible that your baby has a bad case of baby eczema or colic or something of the sort , we know that mommys intuition is something that ca n't be ignored . Thus , today we discuss what is known as a Milk , Soy , Protein Intolerance ( aka MSPI ) diagnosis . <h> What is MSPI ? <p> Milk , Soy , Protein Intolerance ( MSPI ) <p> A temporary inability to digest the proteins found in cow 's milk and soy products . Often referred to as food protein-induced colitis or cow 's milk protein intolerance ( CMPI ) . <h> Who can develop MSPI ? <p> While MSPI can affect any person who ca n't tolerate eating anything that has a milk or soy protein-derived ingredient , it is most commonly discovered in infants or young children who ca n't yet communicate what hurts . <p> Proteins are like legos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of lots of small pieces . Meanwhile , some kids have slightly under-developed intestines with little spaces between the cells . Those big pieces of protein get caught in those spaces and the body attacks those proteins , causing an irritation in the intestine , which causes blood in the stool . <h> Symptoms <p> Although symptoms can vary from baby to baby , common symptoms include : <p> Reflux <p> Upset stomach <p> Gas <p> Runny and painful bowel movements <p> Blood or mucus in the stool ( could be as minimal as little streaks like lint from a sweater ) <p> Congestion <p> Rough rash on the face , head , and chest <p> Colicky behavior ( crying 18 hours or more ) <p> Abnormal sleep patterns <p> Refusal to eat <p> Constantly eating and purging <p> Weight loss <h> How is MSPI diagnosed ? <p> Unlike many food allergies , diagnosing MSPI is difficult because there are no specific MSPI tests . Its mainly diagnosed through symptoms . However , your pediatrician can test for blood in your childs stool . Therefore , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately ! <h> Collecting a Sample <p> Line your babys diaper with cellophane , so you can collect the next blow out and put it in a sterile container . <p> Keep it in the freezer ( we suggest double bagging with a ziploc bag to keep everything contained and prevent leakage ) until you can take it to the lab . <p> Let your pediatrician know you will collect the stool for them . They may give you a container or tell you to sterilize a baby food jar . Some pediatricians will even accept the diaper . Do whatever is asked of you and bring it in . <p> Keep track of your childs symptoms and talk to your pediatrician . Express your concerns and your research findings in a " no-nonsense " manner if you have to . If your child is an adorable chunky baby and is well within the weight range for their age , you may get the " oh its just a virus " diagnosis , so do n't  be surprised if you have to go back to your pediatricians office multiple time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are two main courses of actions for a MSPI diagnosis . <h> 1 . Elimination Diet <p> If baby is breast-fed , momma must remove all dairy and soy protein from her diet . But before you remove anything from your diet , read the labels ! The words nondairy on a product label indicate it does not contain butter , cream , or milk . However , this does not necessarily indicate that the item does not have other milk-containing ingredients . <p> The Kosher food labeled pareve almost always indicates food is free of milk and milk products . A " D " on a product label next to the circled " K " or " U " indicates the presence of milk protein . <h> 2 . Hypoallergenic Formulas <p> The hypo-allergenic formulas break the proteins down into smaller pieces helping the food pass through . <p> There are different hypoallergenic formulas that can be used to ease the pain that your baby feels when eating ; such as Neocate or EleCare which you can find online or through your local pharmacy . These formulas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus more expensive . You can also try Enfamil Nutramigen or Similac Alimentum as these are easier to find in the store . <p> Although these formulas are pricey some insurances will cover the expense so contact your insurance company and see what they can do , it can be considered " failure to thrive " and then they will cover it ! <p> There is currently no cure for MSPI , just time . Children will outgrow the intolerance , some as early as 1 year old or much later . A few unlucky ones may not ever outgrow it . The MSPI diet is n't exactly fun , but there are good resources out there that will help you along the way . As long as baby is growing and gaining weight keep up the good work , it means they are thriving ! 170550 @qwx580550 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Annie Butler <p> Annie lives in North Carolina with her husband and 3 kids .

@@58756469 @7756469/ <h> How I ( did n't  ) Heal after Miscarriages and Secondary Infertility <p> One in four . That 's how many women will experience a miscarriage in their reproductive lifetime . There are so many women out there that share this difficult , painful , and scary experience yet the discussion around it is minimal . Luckily , many women go on to have successful pregnancies after their losses , bringing a rainbow baby into their lives . There are others that have difficulty conceiving or keeping a pregnancy who are left grappling for answers . No matter what , for those who have experienced miscarriage or infant loss , the pain can still be found even years later . <h> My Story <p> My first daughter was born in 2011 . She was a textbook pregnancy and birth , so when we decided to start trying for baby #2 thoughts of miscarriage were not even a glimmer in our minds . It took us months to get pregnant the second time , and when we flew home for the holidays , I did n't  yet know I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas Day , but as we reached our destination , I got my period . I shrugged it off and decided to enjoy the holidays with our family . <p> When we got home from our trip I was feeling a little off , so I took a pregnancy test . Positive ! We were elated . I did n't  even consider my recent period when I went to get my standard blood draw done . When I told the nurse she seemed concerned and asked me to come back in two days to have a redraw . When the results came back , we got the devastating news that my period was actually a miscarriage , and I had been unaware . <p> This basic process happened two more times once 6 weeks later when I became pregnant again and lost the baby in my bathroom , and then again 4 months later when the doctor couldnt find a baby in my growing uterus . My whole body felt like it was being crushed at the news of each miscarriage . I spent days crying after each loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I searched Google endlessly , looking for answers and for others who had experienced the same things . The sight of a pregnant woman ( and they seemed to be everywhere ) made me cringe . Friends news of their own new pregnancies made me want to cower in a corner . I had dreams where I was sleeping , holding three little bundles , and them all falling into a black hole in the middle of my bed as I screamed in horror trying to catch them . I did n't  know how I was going to overcome this , or if I ever would . <h> Secondary Infertility <p> Secondary infertility is something that is rarely talked about when discussing pregnancy loss . Many people , including doctors , have the notion that since you had one ( or more ) successful pregnancies that you will have another if you just keep trying . For some , that is true they may eventually have a successful pregnancy without the help of medical intervention . Others may need to seek treatment or take medications to help bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and confusion surrounding why miscarriages and/or secondary infertility is happening to you can be difficult to bear for any couple . <p> Secondary infertility is defined as the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term after having one or more biological children without any medical interventions . There are many reasons secondary infertility can occur including the age of the mother , traumatic birthing of previous children , or new medical issues for the parents . But many times secondary infertility goes unexplained . <p> Despite rounds of testing , numerous doctors appointments , and hundreds of miles traveled to the nearest infertility clinic covered by my insurance , I still did n't  have answers as to why we were experiencing secondary infertility . My husband and I werent even thirty years old at the time , and we were both healthy and active adults . So why was this happening to us ? <p> One night we had the heartbreaking discussion of possibly not having any more children . We knew our daughter would be an amazing big sister , and with both of us having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships . But we did n't  know what else to do . Doctors did n't  think IUI or IVF would solve the issue since I was n't having trouble getting pregnant I was just losing pregnancies and we could n't afford it anyways . We discussed the possibility of adoption , but again , it was n't something we could afford . Like so many other families , we were at a loss . No one had answers for us , and we felt like we were stuck in this constant roundabout where all the exits were continuously being blocked off . <h> Healing . Or So I Thought . <p> It had been over two years since our first child was born , and we were feeling hopeless . Since we already had a child , friends and family would say things like , " You just have to relax it will happen , " " You already have one so you know you can have another , " or " You should just be grateful for the one you have . " All of those sentiments , although well-meaning , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain that a couple is experiencing for someone who has n't  experienced miscarriage , pregnancy loss , and/or secondary infertility , and it can be difficult to explain all the emotions you are feeling . <p> After a year of heartbreak , loss , and pain with no answers I decided to give up . It is n't like me to quit on something , but I did n't  think I could handle the pain of losing another baby . I did n't  think I could make it through another doctors appointment where they could n't find the heartbeat . I did n't  think I could look at my daughter in the eye again and tell her that there is n't a baby in her mommys belly anymore , giving her insight into death before she was even three years old . I resolved to just live the life we had for now and to stop beating myself up for things I could n't control . <p> I took all these emotions anger , sadness , grief and turned them into action . I could n't sit and do nothing , because that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . I had always been active , but that part of my life took a backseat during the second and third miscarriages . I was afraid to move during those weeks for fear that any activity would result in a loss . But after I was healed from my D&amp;C and a secondary surgery to explore possible uterine cancer , I started running again . Working out almost became an obsession for me . It was a place where I could clear my mind , and it gave me the endorphins I needed to feel better if only for a few hours . I ran my first race , a 10k , six weeks after surgery . I continued to workout every single day , making it a top priority . I would get frustrated if I had to miss a workout for any reason . <p> My career in my previous , childless life was as a teacher . Given my background and my daughters age , I decided to start a preschool in my home . Opening my own business was quite a bit of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at it every day . I opened my preschool only 2 months after my third miscarriage , and enrollment was full within one month after that . <p> In retrospect , these two things were simply coping mechanisms for dealing with the pain of losing my pregnancies . They helped me to forget about what our family was experiencing , and they took away my time from researching , pondering , and grieving . Since then I have barely given my secondary infertility a fleeting thought . I have been open about my losses to others , and even when talking about them I had n't  felt any sense of sadness . Until now . <h> The Pain Returns <p> Since our last miscarriage in August of 2013 , we have gone on to have two rainbow babies . Two more healthy , beautiful girls who came within almost a year of each other . I still do n't  have an explanation for my secondary infertility , and I 'm not sure I ever will . And I had thought I was over my losses , completely healed from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day creeps up I realize that I am not . <p> The tears came on suddenly last week as I searched for a gift for a friend who has experienced loss much greater than mine . I began to think about her babies and about mine , and all of a sudden my heart broke . It crumbled into a thousand pieces . I thought about these three lives we could have known about who they may have been and how they could have changed our family . My heart broke all over again for these lives we will never know . I cried on and off for hours for what our family experienced and for the fact that I have given little to no thought about these losses in the past three years . <p> Its easy for me now to look back and see that I never really grieved over my miscarriages and secondary infertility . After getting pregnant with our second daughter , I felt I had no room to grieve anymore . I kept myself so busy with working out , teaching , running a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other than to let other women know I was available to talk if they needed , were few and far between . I coped by pushing the thoughts back in my head and keeping myself busy . I know now that I will always feel the pain of these losses no matter how busy I am or how much time passes . They were a part of me and although it was only for a short time , those pieces will always be missing . <p> To read more about the causes of secondary infertility and how you can cope , check out Coping After Miscarriage here on Daily Mom . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Lauren Lomsdale <p> Lauren is a full-time mom of three girls , who also happens to run her own in-home preschool .

@@58756470 @7756470/ <h> 8 ways to keep a clean house with a cat <p> For those of us who live with a cat , we know that they are wonderful companions and can reduce stress with a simple purr . Unfortunately , while we consider these adorable balls of fur part of the family , not everyone that visits our homes love the smell or hair that cats seem to leave behind . <p> Just because you have a cat does not mean that other people should know it the moment they walk through your front door . And while having a cat ( or pet of any kind ) may add a little more time to your workload , we know that keeping a clean house with cats is not impossible it just requires some extra work . With that in mind , today we discuss 8 ways to keep your house clean with a cat . <h> 1 . Regularly brush your cat <p> One of the biggest obstacles for cat owners is hair . It settles everywhere , including the furniture , curtains , hardwood floors and carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair up , the easiest way to keep hair and fur controlled is to regularly brush your cat . <p> Sure , cats are grooming themselves all the time , but all that hair has to go somewhere . Hair that is captured on a brush means less hair you 'll have to clean up from your couch and floor later . It also means your cat will have fewer hairballs or constipation as a result of all the hair they did n't  ingest while grooming themselves . <h> 2 . Vacuum Weekly <p> Vacuum at least once a week using a vacuum cleaner with a high efficiency allergen filter ( or hepa filter ) to reduce dust and allergens , and capture most of the hair and cat dander . For even more effectiveness , vacuum a few times a week . You 'll also want to wipe down your baseboards each week as hair and dander will accumulate there too . 170546 @qwx580546 <p> Brushroll Clean is cutting edge technology designed to remove tangles ( often in the form of a simple combination of cat hair , food and toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button for a cleaner floor . The SuctionSeal Technology with All-Surface Suction Plates concentrates airflow for deep cleaning suction power ; so as you move across carpet , hardwood or tile floors the plates raise and lower , creating a seal to maximize airflow for powerful cleaning performance . We 've found that regardless of the dirt or debris , this vacuum will suck it up and away without scattering , which is especially important when vacuuming near the litter box . <p> While this particular vacuum is a little heavy and loud , it has all the conveniences youd ever want in an upright vacuum . Its easy to go from carpet , to tile , to hardwood floors . You can quickly pull the hose off of the clip and add one of the attachments to go directly from the floors to the stairs to the baseboards to the upholstery , or anything else in the room . And , the brush roll cleaner is super easy to use . Simply step on the pedal for 10 seconds and you are done . <p> In addition to keeping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum cleaner will save you time !

Protect Your Furniture <p> Cat-friendly furniture is very similar to kid-friendly furniture ; which means that your sofas have to withstand a lot of wear and tear . Therefore , before you even think about cleaning your house , consider the type of furniture in your home . Choose furniture made of tightly woven materials that are easier to clean . <p> You can also cover your furniture with blankets , throws or pillows that can be washed frequently . If your cat enjoys taking a nap on the couch by the window , the throw serves as a barrier between your cat and the furniture . If company comes over , you can quickly remove this barrier with little fear of your guest being covered in hair on their way home . Just be sure to wash those blankets , throws or pillow cases regularly . <p> If you choose not to use a throw , be sure to vacuum your cats " spot " using the stair &amp; upholstery brush on your vacuum cleaner ( such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your vacuum does n't  have an upholstery brush option , lint rollers are equally effective ( you just have to replace them more often ) . <p> Scratching may also be a problem , so be sure to keep your cats nails trimmed . Also be sure to provide alternate places for your cat to get their scratching fix such as a good scratching post . If that does n't  do the trick , you can add protectors to your furnitures legs and doors . <h> 4 . Wipe down your counters <p> Cats do n't  tend to follow many rules . Therefore , regardless of whether or not you allow your cat to walk on the counter , there 's a strong chance that the same paws that just touched the litter box will also periodically touch surfaces where food is prepared or eaten.More times than not , you wo n't see any evidence of their tracks . However , your cat could be spreading tiny organisms such as toxoplasmosis that can be particularly harmful to children and pregnant women . <p> A disease that results from infection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites often found in cat feces . <p> May cause flu-like symptoms in some people , but most people affected never develop signs and symptoms . <p> For infants born to infected mothers and for people with weakened immune systems , toxoplasmosis can cause extremely serious complications . <p> If you 're generally healthy , treatment is usually not necessary . <p> If you are pregnant or have lowered immunity , certain medications can help reduce the infections severity . <p> To prevent toxoplasmosis , simply wipe your counters down with a paper towel and cleaning solution ( or a cleansing wipe ) before and after you put food on the counter . Also keep your cutting boards , cutting knives , and other food preparation tools inside drawers and cabinets . <h> 5 . Automate Basic Functions ( Food/Water ) <p> For some reason , most people keep their pets food and water bowls in the kitchen . We suppose it makes sense , as a kitchen is often where we eat our meals . However , leaving food and water on the floor of a high-traffic area such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially if you have small children running through the house . <p> Therefore , consider moving food and water to a place where your cat has room to eat and drink without being disturbed , which means less chance of spills . Place a feeding mat or towel under the bowls so that if anything does spill , cleaning up will be that much easier ( and of course , clean those messes up as soon as your cat is finished eating or drinking ) . <p> If you 're busy , consider an automatic pet feeder and water fountain . For one , automating these basic functions will save you time . Gravity feeders automatically replenish the bowl when it recognizes that food levels are low and allow you to store food and feed your cat in one easy step . Meanwhile , cats love drinking fresh water and a cat water fountain provides naturally cool and oxygenated water , with a replaceable filter and a reservoir that adds water automatically . So , you save time and your cat consistently gets fresh food and water . <h> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators that you have a cat in the house is the odor of a poorly kept litter box . Now , it may seem obvious to empty out the litter box more often to remove the smell , but there 's more to it . <p> The best way to contain that kitty litter odor is to contain the litter to a designated space in your home , away from the kitchen . It could be a spare bedroom closet , a bathroom that rarely gets used or a space in your garage . Whatever space it is , try to avoid carpet ( tile and hardwood floors tend to be better ) as it can often trap dirt . If you cant avoid carpet , lay an old towel under the litter box . For added protection , you can even build a small shelter around your cats litter box to consolidate the dust . Wherever the litter box is , be prepared for everything around it to be affected . <p> In addition to containing the litter box to an unoccupied space , you must also scoop your cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than one cat , you 'll want to scoop your litter box at least twice a day ; and if you have multiple cats , you should have more litter boxes . <p> You should fully clean ( meaning remove old litter , fill the box with water , a bleach solution and dish-washing detergent , and give it a thorough scrub ) and renew the kitty litter completely every two weeks . This will further reduce the smell , but avoid using any cleaning products that contain ammonia as it tends to mimic the smell of cat urine ( which would be counterproductive to your cleaning effort ) . <p> Standard ( plastic ) litter boxes should be replaced once a year . Alternatively , you can buy an automatic litter box that will scoop for you after every visit . Each time you clean the litter box , also clean your floors . <h> 7 . Clean up a mess as soon as it occurs <p> One problem that you 're likely to encounter if your cat has yet to be spayed or neutered , is the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , curtains and walls to mark their territory . As soon as you are made aware of this problem , clean it up and take your cat to the vet ( to be spayed or neutered unless you 're planning for kittens ) . <p> Another common problem that causes stains and spots on rugs , carpet and furniture is hair balls . The message is the same . Clean up the mess as soon as you discover it . If there is substance to the mess , first remove whatever it is ( hairball , feces , vomit , regurgitated food , etc. ) with toilet paper ( or a knife to avoid the mess being pushed into the carpet or upholstery ) , then use an enzymatic cleaner for pets such as Natures Miracle to eliminate the odor ( if there is one ) or stain remover to clean up the spot . Interestingly enough , you can also use these cleaners if you are potty training Natures Miracle works incredibly well on potty training accidents . <h> 8 . Deep Clean as Necessary <p> Everyday traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll on your carpet . As a result , routine deep carpet cleaning is necessary.How often you deep clean can be determined by your carpet and lifestyle . Consider the following criteria : <p> Light traffic:If your carpet needs to be vacuumed once a week , you should have deep carpet cleaning every 12 to 18 months . <p> Normal traffic:If you have kids , you should vacuum traffic areas once or twice a week and have your heaviest traffic areas deep cleaned every 6 to 12 months . <p> Heavy traffic:If you have pets ( especially indoor/outdoor pets ) and/or smoke indoors , you should vacuum 2 to 4 times a week , and have your traffic areas deep cleaned every 3 to 6 months . 170546 @qwx580546 <p> While many of the powerful deep cleaners on the market are large , bulky and heavy , the Bissell Pro Heat 2x Revolution Pet Carpet Cleaner really does live up to its description of being lightweight and low profile .

This number is specific to the Ovacue and does not translate to any other charting methods . <p> Why does it track electrolyte counts ? <p> The OvaCue- is a saliva-based monitor that measures changes in the electrolyte levels in your saliva that are impacted by the hormone estrogen . Simply place the oral sensor on your tongue daily and the OvaCue will record a reading of the electrolyte resistance in your saliva . The monitor will track trends in these readings , looking to identify a specific trend that marks the beginning of your fertile window .

It is very simple to do these readings and takes less than 30 seconds a piece . You do not need to enter any additional information into the Ovacue it does it all for you ! <p> Why should you get the optional vaginal sensor ? " For women with irregular cycles , using the Vaginal Sensor along with the OvaCue Fertility Monitor is highly recommended . Irregular cycles are commonly caused by hormonal imbalances . For women with a hormonal imbalance , ovulation may occur before or after the predicted time frame that the oral sensor provides .

Being a mom is n't easy work , and it can definitely take a toll on how you look and feel. - Read on for 7 ways to help you look and feel your VERY best ! <h> LOOK YOUR BEST <p> It takes a variety of different things to help us LOOK fabulous , but as busy moms , we do n't  always have time to incorporate more of anything into our daily schedules . The following , are simple things you can do everyday to boost your confidence and look your best . <h> 1 . Keep Hydrated : <p> Youve all heard it before but it is so very important to keep hydrated . The body is made up of almost 70% water , so it just makes sense . Throughout the day make sure you 're keeping up with your 8 glasses of water per day . Drink a glass of water before bed , and before you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eco-friendly bottle ? Buy one of these EarthLust products . <h> 2 . Moisturize your skin : <p> When choosing a- moisturizer make sure it fits with your skin type . Assess your skin and find out which of the following categories you fit into : Oily , dry , combination , or normal . Often people make the mistake of choosing the wrong product for their skin . Find a really great all-natural moisturizer . Chemicals can dry out your skin , so try to keep it as natural as possible . Be sure to wash , tone and moisturize your face before you go to sleep and when you wake up . One of our favorites is- this Bee Friendly facial cream . Another thing to keep in mind is if you are outdoors a lot you may want to consider a facial cream with an SPF. <h> 3 . Apply concealer : <p> There are a few main areas of the face that need the attention of your concealer . The main one we all know is under the eyes , but here are some other places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark spots , and any other red areas . Using your finger is the best way to apply concealer . Try putting a little bit on your clean index finger and apply to all of the above areas by dabbing until well blended . - We love thisDesert Essence certified organic concealer. <h> 4. - Use some powder : <p> Apply a very light , translucent powder . Use this hypoallergenic and fragrance free Powder by Marcelle . Powder is especially useful- if you know you will be taking pictures . It will make your face appear less shiny with a nice matte finish , and will keep your makeup in place for a lot longer . <h> 5 . Utilize that blush : <p> Put on a radiant blush . Everyone needs a little color in their face ! This blush byCheeky Cosmetics is great ! Apply your blush by first smiling , working the apples of your cheeks , and working up the cheekbone to your temples . Be careful not to over do it , and choose a hue that is flattering for your skin tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great eyelash curler and get to it . This will make your eyes appear bigger . After that , apply your favorite Mascara . It will help to thicken those lashes and make them appear longer . You may even want to apply two coats for that extra effect . A waterproof mascara is always great to keep on hand , but remember it can be tougher to remove . <h> 7 . Add some color : <p> Apply a lip gloss or chapstick that has a pop of color to brighten up that beautiful face ! Have a look at this 100% natural lip gloss from Burts Bees . Believe it or not , there is a right way to apply lip gloss , and a wrong way . Most people will apply a gloss similar to the way they apply a lipstick . Left to right , and then top and bottom . Try putting your gloss directly in the middle of your lips on the top and bottom . Then rub your lips together and this should give you the perfect amount of gloss ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> FEEL YOUR BEST <p> Now that you look amazing , you need to feel amazing . Again , there are many things we can do , but let 's be real , we just do n't  have a lot of time . To help yourself relax and feel good , try incorporating one of these activities into your daily routine . <h> 1 . Do something relaxing : <p> Why not designate yourself half an hour each night for a nice hot bath ? Add some of these all natural bath salts by Hugo Naturals and enjoy a glass of wine or your favorite book . We all have different things that help us relax . For one person , it may be enjoying a nice latte alone . For another , it could be joining a team and playing a sport . Find what helps you relax and indulge in it . <h> 2 . Take some time for you : <p> Yes , all moms need to be alone once in a while . Its not just you feeling that way . We understand this is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , do n't  we ? It is so important for YOU to get some " me " time . Leave your little one with your partner , or any other person you trust , and get out of the house for a biteven if its just a little walk , or going to see a movie with a friend . Everything counts . There are a number of benefits to being alone such as : rebooting your brain , finding your inner voice again , helping to increase productivity , and it allows you time to think deeply . All of these things can help to enhance your relationship with yourself , your family , and your friends . <h> 3 . Cut yourself some slack : <p> Leave the chores and cooking behind . Okay , we do n't  mean forever but moms cant always do it all . Its okay to leave them for a day or two if you 're feeling extremely tired and overwhelmed . Another option is to just get a little bit done each day . For example , one day you can work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its better to set little goals for yourself that you can achieve each day . <h> 4. - Get a Massage : <p> This one is specific but moms can have such intense tightness in their bodies as a result of- their everyday duties . Its true that getting a massage can be expensive , but a lot of colleges and universities offer discounted massages by their students . Why not take advantage of this ? A massage is a great way to help you feel good and get the peace and quiet you 've been oh-so-patient for . <h> 5 . Take a nap : <p> A lot of us moms often dream of having a little nap , but it can be a difficult thing to do . We have so much on our minds and so much to do . We have to remember that- even a 10 minute nap can do wonders for a tired mom ! Have someone you know come over ( Yes , its ok to do that ! ) while you take a nap . You can also do your best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit counts . <h> 6 . Get some exercise <p> You may be exhausted at the utter thought of this , but it does help . Going for a 20 minute run will make you feel so good after , we promise ! If you do n't  like to run , just go for a brisk walk . Remember , physical activity can incude anything that gets that body moving , and it is recommended that you- get physical at least twice a week . <h> 7 . Get out with the kids <p> Going out with your little one can be just as relaxing as spending time alone . In fact , you will probably enjoy this even more . Take the baby to the park and bring along your camera . You can have a mini photo shoot and learn some stuff in the process ! <p> Remember : You always want to eat a well balanced diet to keep you on your toes ! Eating well works wonders for a mom who wants to look and- feel refreshed ! <p> Looking and feeling good will naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and others will notice .

Do n't throw out that Starbucks gold card just yet . Mom 's need to drink coffee ! <h> Wake Up , Mama ! <p> Moms need to drink coffee for the obvious reason , to keep up with the boundless energy of their children . Caffeine wakes you up by stopping a brain chemical that is associated with sleep . It changes the chemistry in your brain when you drink it to give you that alert feeling you desire . <h> The Benefits <p> There are some legitimate health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiled the results of several long term studies and what they found was amazing . <p> Coffee protects our bodies from type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease . This is huge because 1 in 4 women die from heart disease , and diabetes numbers continue to rise . <p> It is possible that we help fight off Parkinson 's disease by drinking coffee . One study found that four or five cups a day cut the risk of this disease in half when compared to drinking little or no caffeine . <p> Coffee drinking is connected to a lower risk of suicide . <p> There is no link between coffee consumption and high blood pressure , in fact , coffee may help with blood pressure . <p> It does not appear that the benefits from coffee come from caffeine , as the benefits are found in decaf as well .

For the healthiest possible cup of joe , drink it black . Try to avoid scooping in the sugar , as sugar is the cause of a lot of preventable health issues and diseases .

Getting a bike should be simple : visit a store , pick out a color , buy . <p> However , the truth is picking out a bike is somewhat similar to picking out a car : there are features to consider , prices to negotiate , comfort and fit to try out and finally quality of construction , materials and safety regulations to educate yourself . Here is a quick low down on what to look for in a bike if you 're new to this . <p> There are several types of bikes : standard single speed bikes like Electra Cruiser 1 , BMX bikes , road bikes , mountain bikes , tandem bikes , cruisers . If you 're looking to take up biking as a family activity , - road bikes for the more active type or cruisers for leisure biking are your best options . <p> While it is tempting to buy a cheap bike on sale at a local big box store , it is much wiser in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route , and select a bike that will last you for many years to come , as well as guarantee your safety , comfort , fit and quality of the components . The cheap bikes you see at big stores might look cute , but they will last you a fraction of the time a real quality bike will and you will end up spending more money trying to get it fixed or replacing it every year . Most importantly , putting your and your childs ( if you are planning on having your baby ride with you , or looking to buy a kids bike ) safety at risk with questionable quality components is never worth the savings . <p> Our favorite bike brand is Electra Bikes . We love a company with an attitude and a character here at Daily Mom and Electra is right up there with the best of them . A bike company that took comfort , style and - functionality to the next level . Whatever it is you 're looking for in a bike , you will definitely find it in one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ticino , Amsterdam and Cruiser . <p> The biggest reason why we love Electra is their amazing Flat Foot Technology . - As a maker for some of the best comfort bikes , they have come up with a bike design that allows the rider to sit up straight with arms in a relaxed position and plant your feet flat on the ground , as opposed to most bikes where you have to balance on your tip toes when stopped . This becomes crucial in a family biking situation where you have an infant/toddler riding with you in a bike seat . Unless you are a very experienced rider who has logged miles of bike use with a child seat , such weight on a bike will throw off your balance a bit . Flat foot technology helps you be more in control of your bike and your child . We feel that is the most important feature of a bike when it comes to young families . <h> Child Bike Carriers <h> Front Mounted <p> A less traditional option for a child carrier , yet just as safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a front mounted seat , like Yepp Mini . Instead of mounting a child bike seat at the back of the bike where your baby ca n't see what 's going on , with Yepp Mini you can put them front and center and enjoy the trip together while narrating and pointing out plants and animals on your leisure ride . This seat is especially helpful for parents with high spirited children who require being in the thick of the action , always moving , always stimulated as it gives them more to look at while riding comfortably with a parent . <p> Made out of a soft , shock absorbent and water resistant material , the seat is very comfortable for the child and is easy to clean with a wet rag . It has all the safety features of a child bike seat , including a 5 point harness and a secure installation with a stem adapter ( supplied ) or a threadless handlebar adapter ( purchased separately ) . It also carries a 2 year warranty for any manufacturing defects and is compliant with the most stringent European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used with a child starting from 9 month of age ( though its recommended that you wait a full year until putting your infant into any bike seat ) and will hold a child until their 3rd birthday or until they reach about 33 lbs ( 15 kg ) . <p> To make your and your childs ride even more comfortable , Yepp offers accessories such as a windscreen to protect from flies and sleeping support that give your child head support when he falls asleep during the ride . <p> Yepp Mini- comes in several different colors to match your and your childs personality and bike color , our favorite of which is bright shiny pink and clean crisp white . <p> While this is a relatively new way of carrying children on your bike for US , it is fairly- popular in Europe and , as parents to very aware and high energy babies , we are absolutely in love with this new way to enjoy our bike rides as a family . <p> Once your child outgrows the Mini seat , Yepp offers 2 other seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini . <h> Back Mounted <p> The Teddy Bike Seat by Kettler makes biking as a family easy . Everything you need to install the seat is included , no need to purchase separate installation sets . As long as you have a screwdriver and a little time the seat is ready ! The mounting system is virtually universal , coming with the equipment needed to fit bikes of different shapes and sizes . The Teddy is a Natural Suspension System , meaning the seat is not mounted to the bike frame but rather at a single point under the bike seat . <p> We love the fun design of the Teddy seat by Kettler . The fun colors and simple racing scheme will have your little one looking the part when enjoying a ride . <p> Your little one will be safe and comfortable in a three point harness that is quick and easy for parents to use . Each harness has a double lock button to ensure your child can not unharness themselves . <p> The foot rests on the Teddy Seat by Kettler can be adjusted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow with your child , keeping them safe and comfortable . The rests also feature a velcro strap to keep those little wiggly feet in place . Behind each of the foot rests is a large storage compartment . This compartment will house all the items you need when traveling with your little one . Snacks , drinks , and diapers can all come along for the ride . <p> Another important feature that will grow with your child is the headrest . The Teddy headrest can raise or lower into three different positions to fit the height of your child , offering optimal security . <h> A Balance Bike for Your Toddler <p> If you think that your 2 year old is too young to ride a bike , think again . Enter the- world of balance bikes , an ingenious invention that not only allows small children to ride a two-wheeled no pedal bike , but let 's them learn about balance while getting ready for the big league of kid bike riding . Toddlers can start riding a balance bike as early as 18 months ( until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then slowly putting their weight on the bike seat and finally gaining enough confidence to take their feet of the ground and go . <p> Strider Bikes , our favorite brand of balance bikes , makes high quality adorable bikes in different colors to match your familys and your toddlers style . These bikes are no joke : they are sturdy yet lightweight , well made , smooth to ride and easy to assemble . They resemble real adult bikes in quality , just really small and lacking pedals . <p> Strider- is n't just a cool and shiny toy . It teaches your child balance , coordination and develops confidence in his abilities . It helps your tiniest member feel like they are a part of the family when biking . Its a first- step to becoming a confident bike rider . <h> Pre-schoolers First Bike <p> Choosing a bike for your pre-schooler can be an intimidating task .

This amazing technology will help your preschooler gain confidence to ride their bike , making it a fun and rewarding activity . <p> Not only are- Electra Kids bikes- made with safety and comfort in mind , they are the most stylish kids bikes around . Say goodbye to those licensed character theme bikes they sell in big box stores and say hello to gorgeous , timeless colors and classic lines instead . <p> Electra carries kids bikes in both 16 inch and 20 inch heights .

This post is designed to educate you about oversupply , as well as offer up some ideas of products or home remedies that can help you manage your supply and bring comfort to painful , swollen breasts . Read on ! If you 've ever complained , tongue-in-cheek , about producing too much breast milk , only to be received with scoffs and phrases like , " I wish I had that problem ! " you know that many times , its hard to find information or camaraderie regarding breast milk oversupply . Oversupply is n't just about producing too much breast milk .

Plugged- ducts are extremely painful , and can escalate into mastitis , if not addressed . <p> Milk Blisters , or " Blebs.

Blebs are also extremely painful , and often times accompany a clogged duct . <p> Mastitis : - Mastitis is an infection of the breast tissue that results in breast pain , swelling , redness , and flu-like symptoms . <p> Let 's dive a bit more into each problem , and learn what can be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick Let-Down : <p> There are two ways to deal with having a quick let-down : help the baby deal with the fast flow , or take measures to regulate the amount of milk you produce and adjust it to your babys supply needs. - To help the baby adjust to your fast milk flow and quick let-down , positioning is everything . Position the baby so he is nursing " uphill " as it relates to moms breast . You can do this easily by using a cradle hold , but have mom recline backwards so the milk has to flow upwards , and " fight gravity , " per-se . Or you can use a football hold , but with mom leaning back once again . Another helpful way to nurse ( especially for the mom on the go ! ) is by using a carrier such as a Moby wrap , or kangaroo shirt and have the baby sitting up and facing mom to nurse . You must also remember to stop and burp your baby often , as they are likely swallowing more air and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also found comfort in pumping before offering their child the breast , and pumping through the first forceful let-down , and then letting your baby nurse for any let-downs after the initial one . If your baby is gaining weight well , you can take measures to adjust your supply to match your baby by offering them only one breast per feeding session . Avoid extra stimulation such as pumping , and only hand express a little milk until it is comfortable . Avoid hot showers with warm water flowing onto your breasts , and use a cool compress throughout the day to relieve any pain or discomfort . 170546 @qwx580546 <p> If you are a constant leaker , we absolutely adore these Washable Breast Pads from BoobDesign .

Milk blisters can be persistent and painful for several weeks , until the skin finally peels away naturally from the top of the bleb . If accompanied by a clogged duct , the chance is high that the obstruction is a tiny , hardened clump of fatty milk that got lodged under the skin , and the skin grew overtop of it .

@@58756514 @7756514/ <h> Formula Feeding Basics <p> Making formula for your baby seems easy , right ? Mix a little powder with some water , shake and pop the bottle into the babys mouth . But , there 's more to the story than that ! What if your baby only wants warm bottles ? How should you heat up the formula ? And , what if the baby does n't  drink the whole bottle ? What do you do with the leftover formula ? Read on for how to properly and safely make , heat and store your babys formula . <h> 1 . Types of Formula <p> There are three types of baby formula : powder formula , concentrated formula and ready-to-feed formula . <p> Powder formula is sold in cans of varying sizes and require to you mix a scoop of the powder with water . Usually its one scoop of powder for every 2 ounces of water . ( Be sure to read the instructions on the back of the formula though , to be sure . ) One of the major benefits is that powder formula travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mix it with water when you 're ready to feed your baby . The powder does n't  need to be refrigerated . ( If you premix the powder and water and take it with you already mixed , then you do need to keep it coldtypically below 40 degrees . ) And , powder formula is the most economical of all formula types . <p> Concentrated formula is sold in cans and must be mixed with water . Typically the can is mixed with an equal amount of water . ( As with powder formula , read the label to be sure you 're preparing it correctly . ) <p> Ready to feed formula is premixed liquid formula and is sold in large containers . Once you 've opened the container , you must refrigerate the entire thing . Ready to feed is the most convenient of all three formula options : there 's no mixing involved . Just pour the formula into the bottle and feed baby . Its also the most expensive . <h> 2 . Making Formula <p> If you 're using powder or concentrated formula , there are several guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First , wash your hands . Formula is not sterile and dirty hands can contaminate the batch . <p> Be sure to use safe water . Many formula cans suggest using filtered , distilled or bottled water . You can certainly use tap water as well , as long as you 're knowledgeable about your tap water and what 's in it . <p> When mixing , swirl formula and water together ; do n't  shake it . Shaking formula creates air bubbles and if they 're swallowed , theyll create more gas , which can be very uncomfortable for the baby . <p> When using powder formula , always use the scoop that came with the can formula . Do n't  use old scoops , even if they 're scoops from the same brand . <p> Measure your scoops carefully . Bottles that have too much water or too much powder can cause stomach problems and discomfort for your baby . <p> How much formula should you make at one time ? Its really all about preference . Some parents prefer to make one big batch of formula a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles when they 're ready to feed the baby . Others prefer to make each bottle separately , when baby is ready to eat . <p> Curious about the safety of your tap water ? Check out Is Your Water Toxic ? to help you determine if your water is safe enough . <h> 3 . Storing Formula <p> Once youve mixed powder formula , you can safely store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours . <p> Ready to feed formula can be stored in the fridge for 48 hours . <p> Once you 've started feeding a baby any kind of formula , the formula can only sit at room temperature for 1 hour before you must discard it . After that , the potential for bacterial contamination is too high to risk feeding it to your baby . <h> 4 . Warming bottles <p> Youve made a big batch of formula , safely stored it in the fridge and now its time to feed the baby . Is it harmful to give a baby cold formula ? If you want to heat it , how should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suggests cold formula is bad for your baby . Many people prefer to heat formula though . If you 're breastfeeding , heating a bottle might make it seem more like breastmilk and could help ease the transition between formula and breastmilk . <p> If you do decide to heat your babys formula , there are a few different ways of doing it . <p> The quickest and probably most convenient way to heat formula is to invest in a bottle warmer .

@@58756516 @7756516/ <h> 5 Rules For Safe Co-Sleeping <p> Co-sleeping ( defined as sharing a common sleeping area with your child whether it be the same room , bedsharing , etc. ) , offers a wide array of benefits to mom and baby . For our ancestors , cosleeping was a matter of survival , and this traditional sleeping practice is catching on again with todays modern mamas . If you 're contemplating co-sleeping with your baby , read on to learn more about the benefits you 'll reap , and how to practice safe co-sleeping . <h> Co-Sleeping Benefits <p> Lower risk of SIDS : Babies who co-sleep have a fourfold lower risk of SIDS because they spend more time sleeping on their back , and it is believed that the exhaled carbon dioxide from mom/dad helps to stimulate babys breathing . Additionally , being close to your baby when sleeping means you 're able to immediately respond to baby if he/she stops breathing , becomes i 'll , or otherwise needs assistance . Babies who sleep next to their parent(s) have more stable body temperatures , more regular heart rhythms , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a reduction in SIDS risk.1 <p> Increased success breastfeeding : Having baby close by means breastfeeding is easier , and mama learns babys cues easier . Rather than mom having to get up out of bed , walk down a hallway to babys room , get baby out of crib , feed baby , put baby back in crib , walk back to moms room , then go back to sleep , mom can simply answer her babys hunger pangs with little disruption . And since breastfeeding is also linked to a significant reduction in SIDS , this benefit is part of the aforementioned SIDS risk reduction . <p> Better sleep for mom &amp; baby : When babies sleep near moms , mama &amp; baby develop coordinated sleep schedules ( is n't the human body amazing ? ) , so that when one naturally rouses during the night , the other does too . This means mom typically wakes up a bit before baby wakes during the night , so she can either get ready to feed , or soothe baby back to sleep before baby fully rouses from sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manage nighttime rousing without either fully waking up , thus falling asleep easier . <p> Improved lifetime emotional health for baby : Co-sleeping has a profound impact on a babys emotional health , and the impact lasts a lifetime . According to Dr. Bob Sears ( via several scientific studies ) , " Co-sleeping babies grow up with a higher self-esteem , less anxiety , become independent sooner , are better behaved in school , and are more comfortable with affection . They also have less psychiatric problems . " 2 <p> Bond between mom &amp; baby : Let 's face it . Moms are busy . If you work full-time , co-sleeping is an amazing way to reconnect and bond with your baby after a long day apart . If you 're a SAHM , co-sleeping is an incredible peaceful time to bond together , when you 're not running around doing housework or tending to your other children . This early connection with your baby will provide a lifetime of benefits . <h> Co-sleeping Safety Guidelines <p> As in any sleep environment , baby should sleep on his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sheets , pillows , stuffed animals , bumpers , etc . Older siblings should not share a sleeping surface with an infant . <p> Do not co-sleep on a couch , armchair , or other non-bed area . Waterbeds are also unsafe . <p> Bedsharing is considered unsafe if you are obese , a smoker , formula feeding , or under the influence of alcohol or drugs ( including sedatives to help you sleep ) . If you fall into any of those categories , you can still safely co-sleep , just not bedshare ( read on to learn how ! ) . <p> Bedding should fit on the bed tightly , and the mattress should fit tightly against the headboard and footboard , and/or sides of crib , if using a side car crib setup . If the bed is pushed up against a wall , ensure that it is tightly pressed against the wall so there is no risk of the baby rolling over and getting trapped between bed and wall . <p> Do not swaddle your baby if bedsharing . A swaddled baby is more prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the use of his/her hands restricts babys ability to move blankets/sheets away from face or alert parent in case of distress . <h> Co-Sleeping Product Spotlight <p> When done safely , co-sleeping offers incredible benefits as explained above , and many products are available to help give parents peace of mind when co-sleeping with their infants . here 's one of our favorites ! <p> Many parents are uncomfortable with traditional co-sleeping by way of bed-sharing , but they still want to reap the vast benefits of co-sleeping , as discussed above . For those parents , or those with any bed-sharing risk factors ( very tiny/premature/low birth weight infant , formula-fed infants , moms who smoked during pregnancy or a baby who lives in a home with a smoker , obesity , alcohol/drug use , etc. ) , the Daydreamer Sleeper is the ideal solution .

Add to that the number of machines you probably have no idea how to use , even after quite a few hours of study from your favorite corner treadmill , and no matter what , you still have n't worked up the guts to go try one of them out . But , what if you could get a great workout from your own home without the fees or the slight feelings of apprehension ? What if you could master some of the gizmos and gadgets that once looked somewhat foreign ? To get you started , here are five inexpensive , but completely effective , items for building your own at-home gym . <p> Ready to Get Fit 2015 ? Throughout the next few months we 'll be posting regularly about fitness and nutrition . All of us here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be healthier and offering each other encouragement . Be sure you keep up with our initiative for some great tips , recipes , ideas , activewear fashion , family fun activities , and inspiration on getting fit and being healthy . And remember " this is Daily Mom so we understand the responsibilities that come with having children and families as top priorities . We are here to help each other incorporate fitness and healthy choices into our everyday life . <p> Think back to the long summer days of double dutch on the playground , and you 'll probably remember the coordination or perhaps lack-there-of that it took to get through an entire song . Jumping rope is a great cardio workout , increasing the heart rate quickly , and allowing you to decide the pace ( and style remember the Figure 8 ? ) . Fitness experts have likened the versatile , cheap , and travel-friendly fitness trend with that of jogging , stating that it torches calories but is actually easier on the knees . Not only does jumping rope up your heart rate , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , lean legs while you jump and your arms , shoulders , and chest while you maneuver the rope . While you probably wo n't want to jump rope for longer than a few minutes straight , there are ways to incorporate a few minute sets into a workout routine so that you are sure to reach your target heart rate between sets of other various exercises . <p> Aside from making a notable doorstop , the kettle bell can also be used to shape and tone every muscle of the body with a multitude of exercises available on the internet . From simple squats , lunges , and dead rows to a full body-shaping swing , this handled-weight packs a punch to an otherwise ordinary workout almost literally . The fun of a kettle bell workout is the fact that the weight can quite easily be thrown around , as shown here in the very popular kettle bell swing , in which your hips are used as the driving force to provide the momentum to swing the kettle bell forward and up . Because of the power that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for a cardio impact , rather than just strength training . For beginners , starting with a low weight and increasing reps ( 10-30 reps per exercise ) as you go will help stave off injury . <h> Starting at only $5.97 for a 5lb weight on Amazon , you cant beat the price of a workout . <p> If you 've done any surfing on the web for abdominal exercises that will score you a 6 pack in no time , you most likely already know that simple crunches on the floor are not the exercise to get you there . But , working those same floor crunches on a stability ball has been found to be almost twice as effective , engaging all of the muscles of your core ( including the transverse abdominal muscles responsible for that oh-so-flat tummy ) as you try to maintain balance while performing the basic crunch movement . <p> Rather work the legs and butt ? Try a wall squat by placing the ball between your lower back and the ball , step your feet forward a bit and slide your hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , and then rise . Not only can the stability ball be used for strength training various muscles of the body , but it also a great tool for stretching and improving balance . <p> Another positive , it can be used as an office chair , actively engaging your core muscles as you work to maintain balance on the ball as it constantly shifts beneath youall while you answer emails , check off the days tasks , or browse your favorite online stores . <p> While the kettle bell can be used for almost all of your weight lifting needs , your muscle groups vary in size and therefore , if you 're interested in building strength and adding muscle to your frame , you will need to adjust the weight that you lift in order to meet those goals . For example , your legs are a much larger muscle group than your arms , therefore you will most likely squat holding larger weights than the weights you will use doing simple bicep curls for the arms . In that case , it is great to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some options and room for growth . Dumbbells pull double duty use the smaller ones during cardio workouts , like walking or training on a stability bike , to up the aerobic intensity or use larger weights to build muscle mass and tone . Buying a set of dumbbells ensures that all of your options are covered . <p> Its all about working out stress and frustrations with this ball of weighted bliss , and what mom couldnt use a little of that some days ? The medicine ball is a weighted ball , varying in size depending on its weight , and is used in weight training to increase strength and power . This fun fitness-find can be tossed , twirled , thrown , lifted , rolled , or simply held . Whichever way works best for you , there is a way to help build your core muscles , and even shape your arms and legs . But if you have some pent up energy inside , this is the gadget to take it out on . The ever-popular Ball Slam is certain to help work out those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over your head and slam the ball down on the ground as hard as you can , grasping the ball again as it bounces back up . Not so stressed ? Add the ball to basic exercises such as side to side oblique twists , or weighted sit ups with a friend . Grab a pal , lay down in the sit up position on opposite ends with your feet together and pass the ball between you as you both sit up together . Continue the sit up motion holding onto the ball , passing the ball to your partner at the top of each sit up . <h> Where to Start ? <p> While Pinterest will inevitably be your go-to for at-home fitness routines , an easy way to get started is to set up your home gym like a circuit . Designate the number of minutes ( cardio ) and reps ( strength training ) you want to do at each station along with the corresponding exercise . Use a kitchen timer or your smartphone and get to work ! For example , one circuit round : Jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3x 12 reps ) , Stability Ball crunches ( 2 min ) , Dumbbell Bicep curls ( 3x 12 reps ) , Medicine Ball Slam ( 12 Reps ) . Continue the circuit a few times or change up the exercises in circuit 2 and 3 to work different muscles of the body . <p> Moms of young children might be interested in investing in adding a good jogging stroller to their home gym if fitness is a key interest . While jogging strollers can be a somewhat costly investment , they are worth the added expense as a part of your home gym as they provide for a great cardio outlet for you , and allow your children to be a participant on your fitness journey .

@@58756533 @7756533/ <h> Car Seat Safety : Rear End Collisions <p> We know that when used properly , rear-facing car seats will provide significant safety advantages in frontal , frontal offset and side impact crashes . However , a question that is often raised is how a rear-facing car seat would fare in a rear end collision . We brought you Rear Facing : Just the Facts and because we want you to be fully armed with all the facts we have done our research and are going to elaborate a little bit more on rear collisions and rear facing car seats . <p> Seventy-five percent of all car crashes are frontal and twenty percent are side impact . These types of crashes are not only more frequent but also far more severe than rear-end crashes . This leaves rear end crashes making up only five percent of total car accidents , and usually occur at far lower speeds than frontal accidents . Logically , you are safest when using a seat that will protect your child in the most common types of collisions , which are frontal and side impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats still being better off in a rear facing collision . <p> In a rear end collision both vehicles are moving in the same direction , which throws the car that is hit from behind , forward . This means that the forces of the crash are far lower than they are in a frontal impact where the vehicle comes to a sudden halt . In a rear facing seat , the childs vulnerable head is positioned towards the center of the vehicle , away from the point of impact . So it would stand to reason that rear facing could be considered safer in all types of crashes . <p> The only time rear facing would have the same effect as forward facing would be if you were to reverse into something at high speed , which is extremely unlikely to occur . <h> Breaking down the accident : Crash Energy &amp; Ride Down Time <p> Crash Energy : Vehicle speed is a very important factor to the energy of a crash . Frontal and frontal offset crashes are the most severe and produce the most " crash energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high speeds in opposite directions . <p> Ride-Down Time : Child passenger safety advocates stress the importance of " ride-down time . " Ride down time is the amount of time it takes for a vehicle to come to a complete stop during a crash . The total force on the passenger is increased with both the weight of the person and with the speed that they were traveling before the crash . <p> The total force on the passenger decreases significantly as the time it takes to stop increases . Most of the time we have no control over the speeds involved in a crash , however , there are some things that help increase the time it takes for a passenger to come to a stop . As mentioned earlier , during a frontal crash the vehicles are often traveling in opposite directions and moving at high speeds . When they collide both vehicles stop very suddenly , in only small fractions of a second . Even a slight increase in your stopping time can reduce the risk of injury considerably . <p> Fortunately , rear-end crashes allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we previously mentioned , the speeds involved in a rear end collision are usually lower than a frontal crash . This creates far less potential crash energy . The two vehicles are also not usually moving toward each other like they would be in a frontal crash . Therefore in many instances one vehicle is allowed to " give , " and the overall ride-down times for both vehicles are much greater , translating to less force being transferred to the passengers . <h> The Importance of a Tight &amp; Proper Installation <p> In the vehicle , the vehicle frame , advanced seat belts , and airbags are all designed to assist passengers in slowing down more gradually during an accident . The purpose of a car seat is to prevent ejection and allow the child to be coupled tightly to the the vehicle . The reasoning is to allow the vehicles frame to provide the necessary ride down time . If your car seat is not installed properly and the installation is loose the child will get less ride down time . This can cause a more severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed the child will slow down more gradually during the crash and reap the benefits of the " ride down time " provided by the vehicle frame . <p> If you are concerned about the installation of your car seat , it is always better to be safe than sorry . Get your car seat checked by a Child Passenger Safety Technician . They can check for proper installation of your car seat and assist you in a correct install if necessary . Visit their website to find one in your area ! <h> From A Physics Standpoint : <p> Delta is the Greek symbol used for change in mathematics , and " V " means velocity . This makes delta-V a change in velocity . <p> In the case of a rear end collision here 's the physics assuming vehicles of equal weight . If a vehicle traveling at 50 mph is rear ended by a vehicle that is doing 60 mph , we have final closing speeds of 60-50 , or a delta v of 10 mph . The delta-vs may vary slightly . The front vehicle may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle smashing into the front vehicle may be slowed by a delta-v of about 4 mph . <p> To sum it up : If you were in a vehicle being rear-ended you would only experience about 10 mph hour change in velocity . <p> In the case of a head on collision where two vehicles are going 65 mph , that 's a delta-V of 65 mph and a closing speed of 130 mph . <p> To sum it up : If you were to hit someone head on you would experience a 65 mph change in velocity . <p> What we can infer : The likelihood of getting injured in front collisions is significantly greater than in rear collisions . Its very uncommon to see a rear end collision where a vehicle is traveling 130 mph striking a vehicle doing 65 mph . But it is not uncommon to see a vehicle traveling , say , 50 mph accidentally crossing the line and hitting another vehicle traveling 50 mph . <p> In conclusion , we all want to do everything we can to protect our little ones in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that you should choose to protect them by rear facing them as long as possible . You should choose to maximize their protection for a frontal or side impact crash which is 95% more likely then a rear collision . Through much research we were not able to find any videos that adequately showed what would happen to a rear facing car seat during a rear end collision . Also , there are not a ton of statistics related to this topic . We have brought you everything we know to be factual so that you have all the proper information when deciding how to keep your children as safe as possible . <p> Disclaimer : The information provided in this post is meant for educational purposes only .

The statement from a " physics " standpoint is comparing being rear-ended at 50mph by someone going 60mph ( very small variance ) to head on collisions with each car going 65mph at each other ( 130mph variance ) . Were talking light fender bender compared to both cars being annihilated ! <p> How about a comparison about being rear ended while you 're at a dead stop and someone hits you going 40mph.or you going 40mph and hitting someone who is at a dead stop . Compare how front vs rear facing carseats affects the kids in those instanceswith references . <p> I 'm more concerned about being rear-end by a drunk or someone texting , while I wait at a light , than a head on collision with someone where I could likely swerve out of the way if I 'm paying attention . <h> Kirsten Wender <p> I came to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear ended on Saturday while I was at a dead stop and the car who hit me was going 60mph My 1 year old was rear facing and she bit her tongue pretty badly and had bruises on her chest from the buckle .

I was ready to throw mine out because of the smell.It would gag you . " Nothing to lose " , so I took the tunnel part outsde and used the water hose to it.You would not believe what kind of filthy water came out of it ! Amazing . I gave it a few days outside to dry and when I tried it out , it was like new ! Desperate measure yes , but it was going into the garbage otherwise ! <p> We have a DC-19 and a DC-25 animal ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step one . You may need a 12 ? or so stick or similar to get out the hair that rapidly builds up in the upper point of the canister . It can be difficult to empty at times . When you empty the canister I suggest a dust mask due to the dust . If I 'm using it for the whole house at once , I kow I 'll be dumping it several times . To keep down the dust , I spray water in the trash bin to keep the dust from previous cleanings down . I use the Dyson but I hate it ! With a passion ! By the time Im done vacuuming , I 'm in a foul mood what with battling the cord , the fact that one side cleans baseboard much better than the other meaning it takes two passes to get the baseboards truly clean and to use a crevice tool requires pulling out the unwieldy long metal tube and putting it back . <h> Val <h> Tommy <p> I have two Dyson DC41s one is a multi-floor model and the other the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different attachments according to there model . But ill tell you all something right now . When i got my re-furbished animal model on Ebay which mind you was an absolute steal and looks like a brand new model . What i was NOT expecting was the noxious odor coming from the machine while in use . So i emailed the seller who told me she had a cat and two dogs but barely used the machine . I thought too myself ; " barely used the machine " ? Then why was the post hepa filter which is the circular disk that screws into the ball paneling part so FULL of animal hair ! ! ! Luckily i 'm still under warranty from Dyson . So they were able to send me out two new filters the circular one as mentioned above . And the cone shaped one that goes on top . Also , along with the two new filters i received a new cyclone assembly and dust bin as well . So at this point i felt like i was getting a brand new vacuum . Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't matter so long as your cyclone assembly is new . Considering that 's pretty much the guts of the vacuum besides the motor itself . This all said , i just was NOT expecting to smell this moldy animal hair like stink . So i thought too myself how can i get rid of this ? Well ive done just about everything one could do to resolve this issue . I sprayed the inside of the telescopic wand with Lysol , sprinkled baking soda/carpet freshener for pets and sucked that up . I even put scented " gel style " bath beads inside the cone-shaped filter that sits on top and inside of the cyclone assembly . And honestly that seemed to work for a bit but not so much anymore . So i 'm basically at my wits end trying to solve this stinky issue . And my theory is that the smell is either coming from inside the ball itself . Or inside the cyclone tubes of the assembly . However , the only problem with that is im not sure how to go about taking those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pet hair or otherwise causing this stink . Its really baffling too me that all of my efforts thus far havent solved this issue . Since i am VERY vigilant about keep my machines super clean . For example , once or twice a month i take my gas leaf blower and blow out the entire cyclone assembly . Now that may sound odd but let me just say it works TEN TIMES better then a bottle of compressed air ! ! ! Simply and obviously because of the stronger wind force to really blow everything out thoroughly . So in closing , if anyone out there has been through this with there Dysons . Or have any ideas on how to get rid of this awful smell for good PLEASE let me know ASAP . Because its an AWESOME machine that works flawlessly .

But you worked so hard to grow the mane , you cant possibly " just shave it " can you ? No no friends , the Daily Dad is here to give you a couple fun loving December ideas and a Shaving-101 review in case this past month was a long one for ya . <p> What you will need is a pair of scissors , a hair/beard trimmer , a razor ( duh ) , a lubricant ( yeeep ) , a moisturizer and an imagination . <h> Consider a brave new weekend warrior look first . <p> Your boss was OK with the beard . Your wife grudgingly agreed . Your kids hated it just admit it . Now take the first weekend in December to reward yourself by having some fun with the beard . Seriously , have you tried a Fu-Manchu ever ? No that thing you tried to do in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lonely Hearts Club Band style Fu fellas . You know the upper lipped thing they all wore on their album cover right ? Why not now ? <p> Then there are some other really cool post-Movember ideas you can consider . Do you have the words to describe the guys below ? Probably not , but here 's to thinking that " X-mens Wolverine " comes to mind . When was the last time you really put a great effort into a " side-beard " ? Oh never ? Well , we cant blame you for not rocking the side-beard to work , but if there ever was a time to put some metal spikes on the back of your hands and run around the backyard with the kids acting like a super hero now is the time . <p> Unfortunately the time will probably come when you will choose to go back to the smooth-baby-bottom look . You will take 5 years off your face without question , which is sure to offset the insulation you will lose . So how do you make sure you do n't  throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of razor burn ? Here is a step-by-step refresher course . <h> Trim . <p> Start with a sharp pair of scissors and cut away as much as you can grab with your fingers . Another option is a beard/mustache/hair trimmer . You do not need to go out and buy one , but if you are considering bringing back the mane in the future , a trimmer of some sort is a requirement to keep your beard tame . No matter what you buy , it must be adjustable . The hair trimmer will have different guards and the beard trimmer will be adjustable . DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP . Shaving a beard directly off is painful and time consuming and you will be face burned all night long . <h> Choose your weapon razor of choice . <p> Tired of paying $45 at the grocery store every time EVERY TIME you need to get a new round of razors ? Still wondering why something that costs 10 cents at the hardware store is upcharged to $5 when its repurposed for your face ? Yeah you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool online subscription services that are coming out that are offering great quality razors at a cheap price . Notably Harrys and Dollar Shave Club . Dollar Shave club has a hilarious YouTube bit where they extol the virtues of their business model and describe how " Our Razors are F**king Great " . <p> The point is that it is getting cheaper and more automated for you to shave now than ever before . No , you do n't  need the vibrating razor with 10 blades and a flashlight . Yes you do need more than a disposable razor . Ouch ! Keep the beard another week and sign up today at one of these online clubs they even have illustrated guides based on how much you shave so you get the right amount of razors every month or quarter . <h> Choose your lubricant wisely . <p> Especially if you have not shaved in a long time you will want to choose your next step wisely . There are a plethora of options out there . Some are foam , others are gel . The cremes are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your skin and for softening your hair . There is a great website , MenEssentials , which have a plethora of unique lubricants that will leave you feeling fresh , soft and manly . The LEA cream shown below is for sensitive skin and has a lemon after-scent . Its a bit more expensive , but is a great product for men who take their face seriously . <h> Take your time . <p> This is the most often forgotten step but the most crucial . You must walk away from the mirror for 1-2 minutes after you are fully lubricated . IF you choose to skip this step you are not letting the gel/foam/cream do its thing . When you let it rest on your face before you attack it with a razor blade , you 'll notice the difference . The shaving cream will continue moisturizing your whiskers , leaving them soft and wet . Just put the razor down slowly and walk away for 2 minutes you can do it <h> Shave . <p> On the first pass , always shave with the grain . This usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your scruff . Going against the grain ( shaving the opposite direction that the hair grows ) makes for a closer shave , but it also produces the most irritation and cuts . If you have a tendency to get bumps or rashes , or if you often get ingrown hairs , or if you simply consider your face too pretty to abuse , start shaving with the grain . <p> Fellas , its okay to make several passes at your whiskers . When you shave with the grain , you 'll notice that you do n't  cut off as much beard as you do when you shave against the grain . You will also notice you do n't  bleed as much bleeding sucks try not to bleed ok ? Its perfectly acceptable to shave once , apply another coating of lather , and shave again . It wo n't make you any less manly . Slow down . <h> Rinse often . <p> You should be running your razor under a stream of , ideally , warm water . This keeps the blade warm and thus cuts hair better and smoother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can pull your skin taut to increase the tension on the blade but do NOT apply pressure to the razor on your face . We repeat , bleeding sucks . Pushing down into the skin with the razor increases bleeding and razor burn . <h> Admire . <p> You managed to get this far . Check out your fine work . Clean up the random spots of shaving cream and be on your way out the door big daddy . Some guys like a post shave skin nourishment . That 's fine , just do n't  rub with a towel , as that can irritate the freshly shaved skin . Use a generous amount of moisturizer that is free of perfumes and other potential irritants ( e.g. baby oil ) if you suffer from dry facial skin . Never apply deodorant , anti-perspirants , perfume , or anything that stings on just shaved skin think Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone . Ouch ! <p> Perhaps you missed Movember ?

@@58756547 @7756547/ <h> Making the Switch : Infant to Convertible Car Seat <p> With all the information out there regarding car seats and car seat safety , it 's easy to become overwhelmed and anxious about whether or not your baby is as safe as they can be . It does n't help that more often than not the guidelines and recommendations for car seats change . It 's easy to be left behind and left wondering if you have it all right . Is it time to ditch the bucket seat ? Is my baby big enough ? Will they still be safe ? Where do they sit now ? We 're here to set you straight when it comes to wondering whether or not your baby is ready to move up to a convertible car seat . <p> For starters , let 's do a quick rundown on the basics of the first two car seats you will own : the infant seat and the convertible seat . <h> Infant Seat <p> While you technically can start your newborn out in certain convertible car seats , an infant car seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the smallest of babies , these rear-facing only seats are not only the safest choice they are also convenient for parents . We 're sure you 've experienced this first hand : the car ride has finally lulled your anti-sleep baby to dreamland at the same time you 've arrived at your destination . There 's no way you 're going to lift your baby out of the car seat and risk a dramatic wake-up , so you unhitch the handy car seat from the base and go on your way . It 's a win-win for everyone . The only con when it comes to infant car seats is babies outgrow them quickly , usually well before they turn 1 year . Be sure to look for an infant seat that has the highest weight/height limit available so you can maximize its usage and your wallet . <h> Convertible Seat <p> The appeal of convertible car seats is that you can use this seat from newborn through child age . Some even convert to a booster , so technically you could only buy one car seat to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned above , an infant seat is the safest car seat for your newborn , so if you 've chosen that route , then your next seat would be the convertible . You can continue to keep your baby rear-facing , but you are also able to flip this seat around to forward-facing when the times comes . A downside to convertible seats is they are heavy and they are fixed in the car , so removing them is a bit of a pain ( another reason why infant car seats are ideal for those first few months ) . <h> Is it time to make the switch ? <h> Switch if the weight limit is maxed out . <p> Every car seat you will ever buy comes with strict weight limits . Be sure to read your owner 's manual and know those weight limits inside and out . When your baby reaches the highest weight limit for the infant car seat , be sure to have a new convertible seat lined up and ready to go . In general , infant car seats max out at a weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All car seats should have a label attached to the seat with the weight/height limits on it . If you do n't have easy access to your owner 's manual , no worries . The information you need is right there on the seat ! <h> Switch if the height limit is maxed out . <p> As well as having a weight limit , infant car seats also have height limits . Again , read your owner 's manual and know what your seats height limit is . Usually babies tend to reach the height limit before the weight limit . The average height limit for most infant car seats maxes out at around 29 inches . When your baby becomes too tall for the infant seat , it 's time to switch them to a convertible . <p> Make the switch when your baby reaches either the height limit or the weight limit . Do n't wait for your baby to reach both limits . If your baby is too tall for your infant seat , but still has several pounds to gain to reach the weight limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Switch if the head height is maxed out . <p> This guideline goes along with reaching the height limits . When the top of your baby 's head is withinone inch of reaching the top of the car seat , it 's time to switch them to the convertible seat . The closer your baby 's head is to the top of the seat reduces the amount of support they need for their head , neck , and spine in the event of a crash . <p> There are no safety concerns if your baby 's legs hang over the bottom of the car seat . It is perfectly okay to let their little legs dangle . Do n't let their long legs fool you into thinking they 've outgrown their infant car seat ! <h> Switch if its too uncomfortable . <p> More than likely , lugging around the infant car seat is getting uncomfortable for you . Even though your baby still fits perfectly in the seat , your muscles ca n't keep up with the increasing weight . You could leave the car seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing it with the baby in it . Instead , just remove and insert the baby for car rides and keep the seat in the car . It might not only be you who is uncomfortable with the infant seat though . If your baby is starting to fight the infant seat , by crying a lot during car rides on a consistent basis , they may be ready to switch too . They could be upset over any number of reasons , such as not being able to see out the window , being too reclined , or feeling too cramped . <p> If you 've researched all the size limits and your baby is still well within the safe ranges , but you still feel as though they may be too big for the infant car seat , it is okay to switch them over to a convertible . As long as they remain in the rear-facing position and they are at least a few months old , there 's nothing wrong with making the switch . While trying to keep them in the infant car seat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ideal safety-wise , sometimes moving up to the convertible makes a world of difference in yours and your baby 's outlook on road trips . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Dani <p> Dani lives in North Carolina with her two preschoolers .

When her brother was born , she was 25 months , and she fit great in the back seat . She can still ride back there with the TOO seat , but there is n't a ton of room . Personally , I 'd say the TOO backseat is perfect for kids under the age of 3 . <p> However , she LOVES the jumpseat option , so it is a great stroller that grows with your family .

Some couples are able to conceive with the help of fertility treatments , others are able to conceive after time without the use of fertility treatments , and some couples are unable to conceive at all . If and when a couple does finally conceive , it did n't  come without an emotional journey and physical exhaustion . <p> Infertility is not sexist and can be caused by the male and not the woman in some cases . There seems to be a common misconception that when a couple ca n't conceive , its the females fault . <p> The journey to becoming a parent is not always full of anticipation and excitement . Rather for some couples , they experience anything but excitement for they may be experiencing infertility . By embracing a healthier lifestyle and making better choices such as ditching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having routine visits to the doctor can help increase the overall productive health for a man . For some males , these precautions and changes in lifestyle do n't  always ensure that they will conceive , so fortunately for them , there are other tools out there that can increase their odds . <p> Today , we discuss a few ways to help increase chances of conceiving if you 're a male . <h> 1 . Exercise regularly <p> Having a gut has been linked to a decrease in male fertility because it causes a decrease in testosterone , oxidative stress and increased temperature in the scrotum . It also causes a negative change in vital hormone production . <h> 2 . Eat healthy <p> Add plenty of antioxidants into your diet as well as cutting out processed foods and soda . There is some research that suggests that by eating a diet rich in antioxidants you may be able to increase sperm count . Eat brightly colored fruits and vegetables , whole grains , lean proteins as well as low-fat dairy for the best nutrients to help increase male fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcohol has been associated with poor male fertility . <h> 4 . Stop smoking <p> The same toxins that doctors warn us to avoid from cigarettes are the same toxins that have been associated with a decrease in male sperm count , motility and morphology as well as altered hormone levels . As if you needed another reason to stop smoking . <h> 5 . Avoid briefs ! Wear boxers <p> Wearing restrictive clothing such as briefs can cut much needed circulation to the groin area which can then cause harm to sperm production as well as decrease the quality of the sperm . Also the use of tight clothing can cause temperatures to rise in the groin area which also affects sperm . <h> 6 . Proxeed plus <p> It may be hard to believe , but sperm health and sperm quality begins to decline around the age of 25 .

Relax <p> Although this is much easier said than done , studies show that relaxing more when trying to conceive can do the body good .

The sooner you get moving , the faster you will start healing so try to take your first short walk within 24 hrs after surgery . <h> Recovery <p> The recovery of an unplanned c-section can , unfortunately , be difficult .

Within 4-6 weeks the incision site will begin to turn white and resemble a normal flat scar . If , by chance , you develop a keloid on your scar do n't worry this can be decreased or possibly completely removed in any subsequent c-sections . The area surrounding the incision will feel tingly and/or numb for weeks or sometimes months after surgery . Fortunately , this area experiencing abnormal sensation should get smaller as time goes on .

After a c-section it is best to wait 6 weeks and be cleared by your doctor to begin working out or having intercourse . <p> SEX : Sorry to say , but you do n't miss out on the possibility of your first time having sex --being a little painful . After giving birth your hormones are going haywire and this can lead to some serious vaginal dryness , so , even if your man is the king of foreplay , I suggest using a little lubricant to ensure things go smoothly . Also , this is not the time to be shy in the bedroom , as you may need to get a little creative with positioning to avoid your partner placing too much weight on your incision site . <p> FITNESS : The first workout sessions after a cesarean will require much more core strength than you might think , even walking , so take it extremely slowly and hold off one any abdominal work until you are feeling 100% .

Okay , to clarify , the bikini you wore on your college spring break trip probably is n't going to happen but the incision will be low enough that most bikinis will cover it . <p> After a c-section you get a longer hospital stay , many parents really appreciate having an extra few days to adjust to their new roles before heading home . <p> You can plan subsequent c-sections , if you choose to do so . This means knowing ( or picking ) baby 's birthday in advance and having the appropriate help for your recovery in place ahead of time . <h> Looking for Un-Nursing Wear ? <p> If you need to add some nursing clothing to your wardrobe , but do n't  want to spend money on pieces you 'll only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on over to Melody Lane for the best in regular clothing that is versatile enough to wear before , during , and after breastfeeding !

@@58756564 @7756564/ <h> 25 Strategies to Beat Teething Pain <p> Whether your baby sprouts his first tooth at 4 months or 12 months , teething can be difficult not just for your baby but your entire household . Teething pain can keep some babies up at night and leave them super-cranky during the day , while some babies are n't phased at all . What 's more , depending on the specific tooth coming through , your baby may have relatively more trouble tolerating the pain ( first year molars , anyone ? ) . We 've rounded up 25 ways to help your baby ( and you ! ) cope . We begin with a look at teething symptoms and then round up 25 options to treat this pain , from traditional treatments to all-natural remedies . <h> Signs of Teething <p> When your baby is teething she may experience some , all , or none of these typical symptoms : <p> Drooling : Drooling and chewing is also a normal development around two months which may or may not be related to teething , so it can be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a first time parent , you may look eagerly in your baby 's mouth to see if any teeth are erupting . But it can be hard to know what to look for if you 've never seen tooth buds just below the gum surface . The emerging tooth ( usually first on the bottom gum ) may look like a long dimple or indentation at first , and then you will eventually see some white . <p> Rosy cheeks : Your babys chubby cheeks may become flushed . <p> Irritability : This is probably a useless symptom to know with the fussiness that can be attributed to those first-year-of-life frustrations and growing pains , but some parents may find it easy to identify irritability associated with teething . <p> Biting behavior : Pressure may feel good to some babies , while others are hypersensitive to it . <p> Decreased appetite : A baby may become averse to nursing , eating , or sucking on a pacifier because the pressure created is painful . <p> Interrupted sleep : Teething pain may not bother your little one during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . When bedtime rolls around though she may have trouble ignoring it . <p> Does teething cause fevers and diarrhea ? <p> The belief that teething can directly cause low-grade fevers ( below about 101-F ) and diarrhea is a point of confusion for many parents . You should always consult your child 's pediatrician if your baby ever has either . While some experts believe these can be a result of teething , fevers are an immune response and could be a sign of something serious , and a quick phone call to chat with your pediatrician or a nurse is always a good idea . Dr. Sears reasons that the excessive saliva associated with teething can lead to loose stools and that the body may treat gum inflammation as in infection , thus leading to a ( low-grade ) fever . Other experts reason that parents may cite fever during the teething period because stress associated with teething can weaken a child 's immune system , thus the association that may exist between illness and teething . However , evidence based studies continue to find no association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teething Pain <p> So you 've established that your baby IS teething . What should you try ? <h> Traditional Remedies <p> #1 . Pain relievers : Infant 's Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) or Infant 's Motrin ( Advil , ibuprofen ) can be used in appropriate dosages to relieve pain . You may wish to try this as a last resort . Be sure to get your pediatrician 's go-ahead first and be sure you 're following current dosage guidelines . Whichever you use ( acetaminophen or ibuprofen ) , be sure to use the dropper/syringe that comes with the bottle and follow dosage guidelines based on weight , not age . Most pediatrician 's practices will provide you with an informational sheet so that you can be certain you 're following all the proper guidelines . A less concentrated version of acetaminophen was introduced in 2011 ( in the US ) , so be sure you are following dosage based on whichever version you have on hand . <p> What about topical teething gels ? While some parents report success with gels , they can be dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can appear within minutes on first use or after repeated use ( 3 ) . What 's more , numbing gels can be dangerous because they can interfere with the gag-reflex . If your baby is eating solids , this could be especially dangerous . Besides , gels of any kind , even non-numbing , wear off quickly and get washed away with saliva making them pretty useless . <p> #3 . Wet or frozen washcloth : This one is simple . Just wet it , chill it , and let your baby chew on it . The cold and/or pressure may help his gums , or at the very least he may be entertained by getting to suck out some water . <h> Free Remedies <p> #4 . Accupressure : Just apply pressure with your ( clean ) finger . Massaging the gums can help increase blood flow and reduce inflammation . Some babies may not like the pressure though , and others may never get used to the idea of you sticking a finger in their mouth . <p> #5 . Nursing and cuddling : While you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep all the time , we think allowances can be made for those nights when teething pain is severe and nothing else works . If you 're afraid of your baby becoming reliant on being nursed , you can also nurse until drowsy at bedtime and continue rocking your baby until he is asleep . <p> #6 . Reflexology : Does it really work ? We do n't know , but we think it 's worth a try especially if you 've exhausted other options ! Try massaging your little one 's toes from top to bottom to target the teeth and sinuses . And while you 're at it , you might simply massage their whole foot to promote overall relaxation . <p> #7 . A change of scenery : If your baby is really suffering from teething pain , now might be the time to try some new experiences or provide extra-stimulating activities . Fresh air can do wonders for your baby , and if not , you will surely benefit and be better able to comfort him . Check out a new park , go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore the aisles ( and maybe let him pick out a new toy ) . <h> From the Kitchen <p> #8 . Breastmilk slushies : If you have not yet introduced foods to your baby , " breastmilk slushies " are the way to go . Simply express some milk into an ice cube tray and wait for them to freeze . Once frozen , add one to a mesh feeder for your little one to suck on . <p> Cold or semi-frozen foods are great for teething , however putting anything into your baby 's mouth poses a choking hazard . Use mesh feeders to give your baby cold treats . If you 're looking for a silicone feeder , the Kidsme Food Feeder comes in several sizes , is well-reviewed , and easy to clean . <p> #9 . Icy , sweet treats with spices : Try frozen mashed banana , peaches , or crushed pineapple . You can blend up any fruit ( without seeds , of course ) and freeze into treats to serve in a mesh feeder . You might even try getting fancy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common spices that have analgesic effects . And if you do n't have any produce on hand , just freeze baby puree or yogurt . <p> #11 . Olive oil : Rub a little bit of olive oil over the gums . Just a dab 'll do . ( Note : Some parents like to use clove oil , though this is not recommended because it is very potent and too much can cause blistering of the gums . Check out Essential Oil Safety : A Guide for Health Care Professionals if you are curious about essential oils . ) <p> #12 . Vanilla extract : Make sure it 's the real stuff , not imitation . Use a Q-tip to apply to the gums to relieve pain . The alcohol creates a numbing and warming effect so the same caveats exist as with numbing gels : use caution and do n't use before meal times . <p> #13 . Chilled foods : If your teething tot has graduated to solid foods , he may enjoy some of his regular foods made extra chilly . Let some pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get cold but not frozen ( you do n't want frozen foods numbing their mouths and throats ) . Bananas , applesauce , seedless watermelon , and yogurt are also great choices for a cool treat . <p> #15 . Barley water : Barley boasts a number of health benefits but it 's relevant benefits here are its anti-inflammatory properties . To make barley water simply add 1/2 cup of barley to about 4 cups of boiling water , reduce heat and let simmer for 45 minutes , then strain . Add the barley water to your baby 's food or teething slushies . <p> #16 . Ice water : Add some ice cubes to your little one 's sippy cup . Your child may find the ice water especially refreshing on his gums . If your child has graduated to adult cups , take the ice cubes out after the water is sufficiently chilled , of course . <h> Herbal &amp; Homeopathic Options <p> #17 . Chamomile : The herb chamomile is a common home remedy used for relieving teething pain and has a calming effect for many individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Soak a washcloth in well-steeped chamomile tea and then throw it in the freezer . You can make chamomile tea ice cube slushies and offer them in a mesh feeder . You can also try diluting a little bit of chamomile tea with cold water or breast milk and offer it to your child . <p> #18 . Camilia : Camilia is a homeopathic medicine containing chamomile and other herbs to relieve teething pain . Camilia by Boiron comes in drop form and can be found in most drug stores . <p> #19 . Hyland 's teething tablets : Hyland 's tablets are probably the most popular homeopathic remedy for teething . They contain chamomile , coffea cruda ( unroasted coffee beans ) , and belladonna to treat pain and relieve irritability . In 2010 , the FDA issued a warning against the tablets ( read it here and Hyland 's response here ) citing inconsistent amounts of belladonna . While the tablets contain very minuscule amounts of belladonna , Hyland 's has since reformulated the tablets and refined its manufacturing process . <p> #20 . Baltic amber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ills for centuries and was first recognized by Pliny the Elder . Amber is a fossil tree resin containing succinic acid ( or succinate ) . Succinate is purported to work as an analgesic , released from amber beads by body heat and absorbed through the skin . Of course , if you decide to try amber necklaces , only let your baby wear them under close supervision . Look for beads that are knotted individually to reduce the potential choking hazard , and look for a necklace with a safety clasp that releases under pressure to reduce the potential strangulation hazard . <p> #21 . Hazelwood necklaces : While less popular than amber necklaces , hazelwood necklaces are also purported by some to offer relief from teething . As with amber necklaces , if you choose to try them be sure they are only worn under close supervision . <h> Good , Old-Fashioned Teether Toys <p> Not sold on homeopathic remedies ?

Sometimes finding the right teething toy can be trial-and-error , so below are some types you may want to try out . Also be sure to check your babys toys regularly to be sure no pieces are at risk of being chewed off . <p> #22 . Wooden teether : Teethers made out of wood like the Little Pal by Green Sprouts and RiNGLEYs natural teething ring are great choices if you worry about what 's in plastics these days , or if you 're concerned about a reaction to natural rubber . Some babies will prefer the pressure they can apply with a teether that 's solid like wood . <p> #24 . Textured teether : A teether with some texture can offer some relief by massaging the gums . Look for one made of silicone that can also be chilled , like the gum brush teether by Born Free . <p> #25 .

@@58756582 @7756582/ <h> 7 Ways to Overcome Poop Withholding <p> For some parents , potty training proves to be one of the toughest battles of child rearing . And if you managed to convince your child to pee on the potty with any sort of consistency , you may find it troubling when your child wont poop on the potty . Even worse , your child starts resisting the act of pooping all together . <p> There are a number of reasons that a child might resist eliminating their waste some physical , some psychological . If you 've ruled out any physical reasons ( constipation , intestinal blockage , etc. ) why your kid is bowel withholding ( of course , check with your pediatrician first ) , then todays post is for you . Not only will we discuss why children may be withholding their stools , but well also share 7- ways to survive this developmental phase. - <h> RECOMMENDED BOOKS FOR POTTY TRAINING : <h> What is " poop withholding " ? <p> Encopresis <p> Also known as paradoxical diarrhea , stool withholding or bowl withholding : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been toilet trained. - <p> This condition is- most common among children between the ages of 2-4 years old , but it- has the potential to- affect babies and school-age kids , often triggered by an episode of painful constipation . As you might imagine , this episode is mentally categorized as a traumatic experience for the child ; so much so that when future bowel movements need to be made , the child will refrain from going #2 for as long as possible in an attempt to avoid being in pain again . In fact , the child may be able to go weeks at a time without eliminating their waste . In this situation , the child may or may not be constipated . A lot of- children who poop withhold are n't  in any significant pain . They will urinate without any problem and play like any other kid . However , the longer they withhold , the smellier the child will become . Your best case scenario is that the childs gas will reach unspeakable limits ( if you 've been here , - you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child when they are resisting to poop ) . On the other hand , this resistance can cause a child to soil their underwear , which can lead to a child who hides dirty undies around the house . Whatever the case , no one is having fun . <h> Why some kids- wont poop <h> Physical Limitations <p> In many cases , a child is experiencing some sort of physical limitation that makes it hard to use the bathroom. - Whether they are constipated , have some sort of intestinal blockage , bowel obstruction , irritable bowel syndrome or even undiagnosed food sensitivities ; pooping hurts . In particular , children with cerebral palsy have a particularly hard time passing stools . You may or may not be able to get to the root of the problem by talking with your child as most preschoolers do n't  know how to communicate why it hurts or how it hurts only that it hurts . If this describes your situation , call your pediatrician to discuss options . <h> Sensory- Aversion- <p> If your child has been diagnosed with a Sensory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to poop because he does n't  like how it feels. - Even if your child has n't  been formally diagnosed with SPD , he may have a sensory aversion to pooping . Kids who have an aversion to pooping would rather clench their- sphincter muscles for days or even weeks than to feel the sensation of waste being eliminated from their bowels . It sounds ridiculous , but it occurs in roughly 1 in 5 kids . <h> Sphincter Law <p> In the book , Ina Mays Guide to Childbirth , - Ina May Gaskin describes something she calls the " sphincter law . " - Yeah , it seems a little odd to reference a child birthing book while talking about kid poop , but stay with us . Just as we- think of the cervix and the vagina as a type of sphincter ( relative to childbirth ) , the same laws of taking a poop successfully , apply to delivering a baby . So , in much the same way that many of us have difficulty having a bowel movement in a public restroom , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go as soon as we are back in the comforts of our own home ; children experience the same sort of thing except that a 2 year old finds comfort in a quiet corner ( or by the train table ) so that they can relax their body enough to poop. - Essentially , we all crave some sort of privacy and solitude in order to do our " business . " However , - the sphincter does n't  react well to time limits or pressures to poop on demand. - <h> Fears or- Bad Experiences <p> Many children willaccept pooping in a diaper ( or their underpants ) , but will avoid pooping in the toilet at all costs . All kids are different , but common fears include being afraid of balancing on the potty or falling in , the sound of the toilet as it flushes , or fear of the bathroom itself ( maybe the " Boogie Man " sleeps there during the day ? ) . Alternatively , a child may just have a bad memory associated with pooping. - This can easily happen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood in their stool . It could also happen if an older sibling or another child makes fun of them over a poopy situation . Of course , while were on the subject of bad experiences , be sure that you rule out any possibility of sexual or physical abuse , which can also be a root cause for elimination issues in young children . <h> 7- Approaches Worth Trying <h> 1. - Be VeryVery Patient <p> First recognize that everyone poops in their own time . For some people , that means after every meal , for others it means once a day , and for others it means every few days . Whatever the case , everybodys body is different . Even knowing that , you 're going to get frustrated with your child when they withhold , but forcing the issue will not make anyone poop on demand . It may take some time , but your child will eventually figure it out . In fact , the best way to deal with the situation is to act as if it does n't  bother you at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the situation , the more it becomes a problem . <h> 2 . Read <p> If your children are anything like our children , they love to read and be read to . Just as you read books about colors and shapes , parts of the body , their first trip to the dentist and their favorite fairy tale characters , be sure to read and talk to your child about poop . Here are a few of our favorites : <p> " Wheres the Poop " by Julie Markes This fun- lift-the-flap book shows children that all creatures have a place to poop : tigers in the jungle , kangaroos in the outback , and monkeys in the rain forest . Your child will see that he or she has a place to poop , too . <p> " It Hurts to Poop : A Story for Children Who Are Scared to Use the Potty " by- Howard J. Bennett In this book , the main character ( Ryan ) is scared to use the potty . He s afraid to have a poop because he s afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit Dr. Gold , she engages his imagination with the story of Bill the Coyotes messy house . She also shows him what happens inside the body , and explains how different foods make using the potty easy or hard . This story , along with Ryans " poop program , " will help young children gain the confidence they need to overcome this common problem and establish healthy habits . <p> Alternatively , if your child responds well to videos , we really like these " Potty Time " videos by Two Little Hands . The main message is " listen to your body when you need to go potty . " Its kinda catchy ! Either way , when you notice that your child is demonstrating signs of needing to poop , get down on their level and talk about it . You can reference the books and characters . Keep your conversation simple , nonjudgmental and to the point . What does it feel like ? Does it hurt ? Does it feel weird ? Is it scary ? Kids do n't  always know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help your child better use their words . - <h> RECOMMENDED POTTY CHAIRS <h> 3 . Establish a Routine <p> A consistent routine is often the key to creating a pattern of elimination . Its as simple as keeping regular meal times , followed by a trip to the bathroom . If you can encourage your child to use the bathroom at these regular intervals ( after waking up , following a meal , before bedtime ) ; the stomach , bowels and bladder will have a chance to empty . Its much like when- your mom asked you to use the potty before getting in the car for a long road trip. - The same thing can be done here , but you do n't  necessarily have to be going on a road trip . And , this is n't to say that your child will eliminate waste every time they sit down on the potty , but food tends to stimulate the bowel. - <p> Avoid using the potty as punishment ( ex. " you better poop on that potty or I 'll take away your iPad ! " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go great ; but do n't  express disappointment or frustration if they do n't  . Just keep trying. - Over time , you 'll find that your child follows a pattern . Rather than forcing poop on your schedule , just follow your kids natural routine . <h> 4. - Adjust Your Childs Diet <p> Many times , your healthcare provider will suggest that you increase natural fibers in your childs diet . While this can encourage the bowels , it may not cure the situation . However , its never a bad idea to emphasize non-constipating foods , increase natural fibers found in most fruits and vegetables , make sure your child is getting plenty of fluids ( water and juice avoiding sodas that dehydrate ) and limit foods that have a tendency to constipate . <p> The goal here is to keep those stools soft and regular in the event that there is any hint of constipation or pain . However , if your child is not constipated and is withholding for other reasons ( mostly psychological ) , even a healthy diet wont do the trick . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended to- kids who bowel withhold is the use of a fiber supplement , laxative , stool softener or enema . Talk to your pediatrician before trying any of these options , but- a daily half-cap dose of Miralax mixed with your childs morning cup of juice helps a lot . Your child may still go through bouts of withholding , but when you start applying all of the- approaches listed , your child may relax long enough to let their body do what it needs to do . <h> 6 . Ensure their Comfort <p> Figure out where your child prefers to use the bathroom and roll with it . If that means your child will only pee and poop on their- little potty , suck it up and buy that exact potty for every level of the house ( even bring it on the road with you when visiting relatives ) . Yes that means more cleaning for you , but your job is to remove any obstacles that may be preventing them from making poo . <p> What if your child is only comfortable pooping in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child is withholding , at some point you will realize that its more important that they eliminate waste in a diaper than it is that they poop in the potty . In fact , there are many preschoolers ( and older kids ) who are " pee trained , " but will request a diaper just for pooping . Pay attention to their pooping behaviors though . Typically , children will seek some form of privacy to empty their bowels ( be it in a corner , behind furniture , squatting in front of the train table , etc . ) . Gradually encourage them to take that private moment to the restroom , even while staying in a diaper . <p> Over time , you might suggest that they sit on a potty ( big or little ) and poop again , still in their diaper . Then , cut a small hole in their diaper and increase the size of that hole over a period of weeks until your child is pooping through the diaper straight into the toilet . Alternatively , if the sound of poop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sit on the potty directly while having a diaper taped under them ( on the potty ) to catch the poop . If it sounds like a lot of work it is , but poop is poop. <h> 7 . Rewards ? <p> Some parents find that reward systems work really well for their kids . So , if your kid will poop for stickers that will eventually earn a toy , more power to you . Our experience has been that the relief of pooping is enough of a reward . <p> If you 've put all of the other tips into action , you 'll find that your child has all the tools they need to overcome whatever it is that is preventing them from pooping . When they do finally get over that hump , it feels good and theyll want to celebrate it with you in some way or another ( high fives , hugs , etc . ) . Not only is their body thanking them , but there is a sense of accomplishment. - <p> We know how frustrating this situation is , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Some people feel limited by their focal points , while others feel that constantly changing your focal points slows down the process . <p> Either way , if your shot is not in focus , it does not matter how many focal points your camera has .

The focal point is too small to cover the area you 're trying to focus or its not exactly where you need it to be . <p> What do you do then ? Since most cameras default to focusing on the center of the frame , you could just leave it there and use a technique called " Focus and Recompose . " <h> What is recomposing ? <p> Composing an image starts by framing your shot and placing your subject somewhere within that frame before pressing the shutter release button . Recomposing simply means framing your shot first , focusing on your subject , and then moving your camera such that you 've moved your subject to a new position within the frame . <p> For example , let 's look at the two images below . Your child is running down a dirt road , so using your center-point focal point , you frame the shot ( if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Specifically , set your focal point on the eye that is closest to your lens . The eyes should be the sharpest and clearest point within the image ( unless you are going for something artistic ) . If you are shooting more than one person , be sure to adjust your aperture accordingly . <p> For example , let 's take a look at the image below . We used the focal point on the far right to focus on the little girls eye . <p> While you 're still learning how to shoot in manual mode , focus on your subjects eyes . As you gain more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the eyes . Get creative . Experiment . <h> And if you miss your focal point ? <p> It happens . Especially when photographing children or if you 're shooting " wide open . " For example , you may or may not be able to tell that the image below is out of focus . <p> So , let 's look again , up close . <p> Yep . Definitely OUT OF FOCUS ! - <p> Like all things , mastering focal points takes practice . You 'll also find that each lens you use has a sweet spot with regard to focus and sharpness. - If you 're finding that you are consistently missing your focal points , consider opening up your aperture ( higher number ) or changing your auto focus setting.And if you are consistently having problems , take your camera in to your local camera shop to be serviced . <h> Practice <p> Use Aperture Priority or Manual for todays practice assignment . <p> Adjust your Auto Focus Mode to One Shot/AF-S . <p> Find a couple of your childrens toys ( or other inanimate objects ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also an opportunity to play with composition ) . <p> Adjust your aperture to the lowest number available on your lens ( f/1.8-4 ) . <p> Using " Focus-Recompose , " focus on the object in the front and take your first photo . Focus on the object in the back and take a second photo . <p> Believe or not , there 's still a lot more to talk about with regard to focusing and focal points . Have you heard of " back-button focusing ? " For now though , keep working on nailing those eyes and well talk about a few of the advanced focusing techniques in the future . While you 're practicing , if you run across anything that does n't  make sense , feel free to- ask questions in the comment section . <p> For more lessons on getting to know your camera , check out our post on White Balance 101. 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Ashley Sisk <p> Ashley lives in North Carolina with her husband , two children and Kitty Paw .

@@58756591 @7756591/ <h> Dos &amp; Donts for Capturing a Natural Smile <p> Capturing a natural smile should be easy , but its often one of the most difficult tasks asked of a photographer . For whatever reason , people ( children and adults alike ) tend to grimace or give a forced expression when asked to smile for the camera . We wont get into the how or why this happens , but today we will offer a few dos and donts for capturing a natural smile from children . <h> DO NT : SAY CHEESE ! <p> Contrary to popular belief , the most natural smiles do not appear when you " say cheese , " or ask a child to smile . It just does n't  happen . And it definitely does n't  happen when we get desperate for a smile . <p> Unfortunately , we know that " CHEESE " magically finds its way into every kids vocabulary , regardless of how much we try to avoid it . In fact , weve often talked about how our own kids will say " cheese " on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything , try saying " PIZZA , " or " SNAKE . " Better yet , find out if the child has a trigger word that makes them light up , such as " POPSICLE ! " Just be prepared to get that kid a popsicle after the session as a reward . <h> DO : Act Silly <p> A better way to capture a natural smile is to act silly . Kids love to be silly and if you 're acting like a fool , there 's a strong chance of that child laughing at you . <p> This approach often works better on other children , you know , the ones who do n't  live with you . Your own kids know your old tricks , but other children do n't  often see all that silliness coming . Try telling jokes , or saying the wrong words on purpose , or dancing , or making ridiculous noises . <h> DO NT : SCHEDULE PHOTOS DURING NAP TIME <p> The best time of day for photography is during the hour right after sunrise or the hour just before sunset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most kids who rise early and do n't  want to go to sleep until the sun has gone to sleep . If possible , plan your photo sessions during those times . <p> If that 's not possible , you should at least avoid nap and meal times . A tired and hungry child will cry , not smile . Pay attention to those basic functions and you 're much more likely to capture a natural smile . <h> DO : Keep it Moving <p> Before you ever start shooting , have a mental plan for your shoot . If your session requires props , have those props ready ; and if you need time to adjust your settings , do so before asking your tiny models to join you . <p> Kids get bored if they have to wait more than a minute so be prepared and keep your session moving . Most young children do well to change things up every 2-3 minutes . <p> Just remember that a successful photo session is not measured in the amount of time you spend shooting . Success is measured in your ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , PLEASE Do n't  Smile <p> For some reason , kids eat it up when you tell them NOT to smile . It tends to go something like this : <p> " Alright , if you 'll just sit there and look serious , thatll be great . Whatever you do , do n't  smile . " <p> Kid starts smiling . <p> " What ? ! I thought I told you not to smile ? ! " <p> Kid starts to giggle and you 've got them right where you want them ! <p> Variations of this method are just as effective . Ask for a mean face and then scream as if you 're scared . You 'll not only get a smile ; you 're bound to get a few laughs . Just make sure your shutter speed is fast enough to capture all the happiness.Chances are that you 'll be laughing just as much and you do n't  want to miss the moment because of a little camera shake . <h> DO : Get to Know Your " Customer " <p> One of the best ways to capture a natural smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into an environment that makes them happy . With your own children , you have the opportunity to capture happiness often ( easier said than done ) . <p> However , when you 're asked to photograph other peoples children , be careful to spend some time making a connection with the child you 're photographing before you ever start shooting . <p> Find out what the child likes to do . Do they have a favorite color or activity or dance move they want to share . Get them involved in the session and itll be a lot more fun for everyone ! <h> DO NT : BE AFRAID TO TAKE A GAZILLION PICTURES <p> The great thing about digital photography is that you take as many pictures as your memory card will hold . Some call this the " spray and pray " approach , meaning that you may take 100 or more pictures with the hope that maybe 10 are worth saving . <p> Take advantage of the continuous shooting mode on your camera.Each time you press the shutter button , you 'll be able to capture at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll capture a hand full ( or more ) of beautiful and natural smiles ! Just remember to delete any duplicates or unfocused shots in post-processing . <h> Do : Show Your Screen <p> Kids love to see what you 're doing . If they ask to see your screen , show them . In many cases , theyll think its funny to see themselves in your camera and want to do it again . <p> Or theyll love the instant gratification of seeing whatever face they thought was so great in their head . With older kids , you can show them the difference in a fake smile and a real smile . <h> Do n't  : Use " Discipline " to Force a Smile <p> Feel free to discipline your children however you see fit , but try to avoid using any sort of discipline tactics to force your kid into smiling . In our experience , if a child has decided that they are not in the mood for photos , they will rarely " shape up " just because you said so ( or worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just end the session and reschedule for a better time or take a break to address any biological needs ( example : snack or potty break ) . <h> Do : Have fun ! <p> As far as kids are concerned , their sole purpose in life is to have fun , so why not join the party ? Set the stage for fun by creating the perfect environment for their little imaginations to run wild . <p> Bring along a box of dress-up clothes , a tea party , bubbles , a kite or any other fun props that you think they might enjoy and see what happens . Alternatively , just go to a fun place or turn your photo session into a game . Whatever the case , have fun with it because " fun " is the key ingredient in a natural smile . <p> Whether its a big toothy grin or a shy smile , with the right moves , a natural smile is within reach .

@@58756599 @7756599/ <h> What You Need To Know About Diastasis Recti <p> Would you believe that there is a condition that at least 30% of pregnant women and 66% of women with 2 or more kids have and yet most of them do not know about ? Diastasis Recti is the separation of the abdominal muscles and the thinning of the connective tissue between them . This condition is not solely the result of pregnancy , but its quite common . This article will outline the basics of what every woman should knowbefore , during , and after pregnancy , about conditioning and rehabilitating their abdominal muscles for better function and ( bonus ! ) to improve their appearance . <h> What Causes a Diastasis Recti ? <p> Diastasis recti is caused by intra-abdominal pressure . This can be the result of : <p> poor alignment <p> pregnancy <p> weak abdominal muscles <p> excessive body weight <p> Even " fit people " such as body builders will develop a diastasis recti due to pressure from improper core engagement during heavy lifts and the intra-abdominal pressure created from doing crunches . Yescrunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this last point . <h> How Do I check for one ? <p> There are numerous programs on the web that will help walk you through how to check for a diastasis recti and then connect with you with their program for help with fixing this condition . For learning about how to check for one at home , please read the following instructions and then watch the linked video . It is important that you know how to properly check for a diastasis so that you do not do more damage to your core in how you check for one and so that you get an accurate reading . Many women check for a diastasis incorrectly , leading them to believe that they do not have one ! Only later ( sometimes years later ! ) they come to realize that their core and pelvic floor are not functioning optimally and it is all because of a diastasis created years ago . Soto check for a diastasis , do the following : <p> Find a comfortable place on the floor where you can lay down . <p> Kneel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated , slowly slide down on your side ( many programs refer to this as the " sexy slide " ) using your arms to help you down , engaging your core ( if you can and know how ) as you move . <p> From your side , roll onto your back . Keep your back in neutral spine ( the small of your back should have a small gap from the floor ) and bend your knees with both feet firmly planted on the ground at hip distance apart . <p> Lift up your shirt and unbutton the top button of your pants . You need to have access to the 2-3 inches above and below your belly button . <p> With one hand at your belly button , slowly raise your head about 1-2 inches off the ground . Do not raise your head up too far or allow your back to come out of neutral spine ! Your back should naturally stay neutralassuming that you do not lift your head too much to engage in a crunch like movement . <p> With your fingers , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partum women will have a slight dip herebut its only considered a diastasis when it is 2 or more finger widths apart and the connective tissue between the muscles are weak/deep . You are hoping to feel for a gap that is 2 finger widths or less AND for shallow depth , with connective tissue that is firm to the touch . <p> Once you have checked at the belly button , check for a gap between your abdominals about 2 inches above and below this center point . For most women , the gap is largest at the belly button . Remember to check for not just the width , but also the depth of the gap . <p> For a good understanding of the depth , feel a few inches higher on your abdominals . Herethey should be closed with strong connective tissue in between . If your connective tissue is weak , you may be able to put your fingers in up to the 2nd knucklesalmost like you 're reaching to touch your spine . You want the connective tissue to not only feel both firm and slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but you should also not be able to press down more than about half of a fingernail deep . <p> Note:Daily Mom does not endorse a particular core and pelvic floor rehabilitation program at this time . This video was simply chosen for its brevity , accuracy , and clarity . <h> What can I do about it ? <p> Depending on the program , a few different theories abound about the " best " way to correct a diastasis recti . However , the practitioners behind each of these programs seems to be in agreement that it is never too late to heal your core ! Do a quick internet search of diastasis recti programs and you 'll find stories from women who had kids 10 years ago and have been able to bring their abdominal muscles back together and strengthen the connective tissue . Stillthere are some basic ideas that seem consistent across the board when it comes to restoring your core and pelvic floor . <p> When you do any type of squatting , lifting ( including a laundry basket , a child , and hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to properly engage your core . You engage your core by drawing your transverse abdominals toward your spine . This is the internal corset that wraps around your body and helps to give you flat abs , provided that you have proper alignment and a healthy diet . When you engage your core , you are NOT sucking in or holding your breath ! <p> Healing your diastasis will often improve your pelvic floor function . The two work in conjunction and both are caused by too much pressure and poor/lack of engagement . <p> If you are not yet pregnant , but planning on it , you can do your research now ! Read up on how to check for a diastasis throughout your pregnancy and for pregnancy safe exercises to do throughout your pregnancy ( although make sure to check these programsany program that encourages pregnant women to crunch or do movements in a prone position like push-ups and planks are to be avoided ! ) . <p> Research the pros and cons of splinting during and after pregnancy . This is perhaps the biggest debate between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that splinting in the immediate weeks postpartum are alright if it makes the wearer more comfortable , if their gap is large , and/or they are able to use a splint and maintain awareness of their abdominals ( and not rely on the splint to do all the work ) . Other programs , however , claim that a splint is essential for approximating the two recti back together while doing the various healing exercises , and others advocate firmly against splinting , arguing that they increase intra-abdominal pressure that can worsen a stressed pelvic floor after delivery or even cause a hernia due to weak connective tissue . The bottom line is that there is a lot of research out there and its important to find what works best for you . The middle ground might be optimal if you are about to or recently had a babyprovided the splint is worn very temporarily . However , there are thousands of success stories by women using all of the various programs . <p> If you do have a diastasis , refrain from doing crunches and movements in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can not safely do without proper core engagement . Many women come to find that their core is quite weak after pregnancy , but have continued to do exercises that they did not have the proper strength for in the interest of losing their " gut " or " mommy tummy " . These moves , however , are counterproductive and should be avoided at all costs . <p> Read up on proper alignment . Alignment is not the same thing as posture.This blog , written by biomechanist Katy Bowman , has loads of free information on correcting your alignment , in addition to her several books for sale on her site . Its worth a read to check out how your alignment and everyday movement affect your core and pelvic floor . <p> Why crunches are to be avoided : Crunching increases the internal pressure in your abdomen . Since it is impossible to engage your transverse abdominis , it is counter-productive toward knitting your muscles and connective tissue back together . Even Joseph Pilates famously had a diastasis recti and anyone who has done pilates knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say that you can never do pilates againbut you should not do them with a gap and should use caution about doing too many of any exercise that increases the pressure in your abdomen . <h> How important is it that I fix it ? <p> One of the reasons that more women have a diastasis after multiple children is that they never fully healed their core after their first baby . Therefore , with each subsequent pregnancy , their abdominal muscles started in a more separated position and got stretched further apart . If you are reading this and considering getting pregnant again , check to see if you have a diastasis and work with a physical therapist specializing in diastasis and pelvic floor rehabilitation and/or check out one of the many excellent online programs . Fixing your diastasis is not just about looks . What we 've tried to emphasize here is the importance of core function .

@@58756609 @7756609/ <h> Tips &amp; Tricks for Preparing Freezer Meals <p> Whether you 're a working mom or a stay-at-home mom , preparing meals can be a daunting and time-consuming task . When you or the kids are hungry , and you 're short on time , its easy to grab something not-so-healthy just because its quick . But , by spending a few hours a week preparing meals and freezing them , you can eliminate much of the stress related to meal prep . The end result is that you 'll eat better as well as- save yourself so much time and money ! But , what kinds of foods freeze well ? How should you store them in the freezer ? We will give you the low-down , along with some favorite recipes ! <h> Tools of the Trade <p> You 'll need a few things before you get started preparing and freezing your meals . <p> Zip top baggies in gallon size and sandwich size <p> Plastic wrap <p> Large reusable containers that you do n't  need on a daily basis . We love these , made by Wean Green . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze the best . <p> Muffins and quick breads ( like pumpkin bread ) freeze really well . The best way to freeze them is to wrap each muffin or slice of quick bread individually , using plastic wrap.When you 're ready to eat one , take it out of the freezer , unwrap it and set it on the counter for about an hour . Itll defrost slowly and no moisture will build up . Then , you can grab it and eat it whenever you have a minute . <p> French toast and pancakes also freeze well . <p> Muffins and breads are the only foods you should defrost on the counter . Everything else should be safely thawed in the fridge , in a bowl of cold water , or in the microwave . <h> Lunch &amp; Dinner <p> When it comes to lunch and dinner foods , the key is to decide whether you 'll freeze in individual portions or one large portion . <p> If you freeze individual portions , theyll defrost/reheat faster . But , when its time to eat , you 'll have to decide how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the defrosting/reheating time takes longer , but then you 'll have a big meal to serve the whole family . <p> You can put frozen food straight into the oven or you can defrost it in the refrigerator and then heat . <p> When freezing individual portions , use muffin tins ! Silicone ones work best , but your regular muffin tins will work too . Just be sure to lightly grease the muffin tin . <p> Make your favorite chili , soup or sauce ( like the pesto below ! ) and freeze it in muffin tins . Once its fully frozen , pop out the individual portions and store them in zip top bags . <h> - Slow Cooker Freezer Meals <p> Another time saving tip is to assemble large zip top bags with all the ingredients you need to make your favorite slow cooker meals . <p> Put all ingredients together and freeze them raw . <p> Take them out of the freezer the night before you 're going to use them so they defrost . ( Its ok if they 're not 100% thawed by time you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't be frozen solid . ) <p> In the morning , dump them into your slow cooker and set it for 6-7 hours on low . <p> Later on you 'll have a great meal with no fuss ! <h> Shelf Life of Frozen Foods <p> In general , frozen food keeps for approximately 1-3 months . For this reason its helpful to keep track of the date you made each food . <p> If you 've made a big batch of food , label the container with the date . <p> If you 're storing food individually ( like individual muffins or pancakes ) , make a list with the date prepared and tape it inside the freezer so you wo n't forget .

@@58756610 @7756610/ <h> Tips &amp; Tricks for Building Resiliency in Your Child <p> Two words : Bubble Wrap . In todays media-saturated in-your-face world , most of us would probably love to wrap our little ones in bubble wrap protecting their bodies from all harm , their hearts from all the ugliness the world sometimes has to offer , and their minds from all thoughts of inadequacies or messages of you 're just not enough ( fill in the blank ) that can be found lurking around every corner of society . <p> Unfortunately , we cant wrap our children in bubble wrap ( though were sure they would be willing participants ) , but we can set them up with the right tools to face adversities and be able to bounce right back and push on through when life people , school , careers , love gets tough and the stress of it all becomes too much . <p> Ever wonder why some people naturally handle stress better than others ? When a problem or sudden challenge arises , instead of wavering , backing down , or turning to others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They appear confident and calm , even though chaos may be ensuing around them . If a mistake is made , they learn from it and move on . Others self-doubt , they waiver in their decisions , and let thoughts of their inadequacies get the best of them . They dwell in their mistakes . People with little resiliency skills often rely on others and have difficulty adapting to change , while those with resilience are often very successful , adapting to what life has to throw at them . <p> So , how do we as parents give our children the tools to be resilient human beings ? While resiliency is inherent in us from birth , and some of us are just more resilient naturally than others , our personal experiences from childhood into adulthood do have an effect on how we handle stress and adapt to change . As parents , there are a few things we can do to ensure that our children have the right tools to adjust to challenges that might come their way : <h> Tip # 1 : Start with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children need to know that they are unconditionally loved . Children from a loving home where parents show unconditional love are more confident in themselves and feel a deep level of security , two things needed in resiliency . Children need to know that even though they may make mistakes , they will still be loved by the most important people in their lives . This level of security and connection reinforces family values and morals , shows children how to positively resolve issues , how to positively work together with others , and how to express emotions in a healthy way . <p> Trick:Whilesaying " I love you " can go a long way , showing it on a daily basis , especially during our most unlovable moments , has a much greater effect . <h> Tip # 2 : Compliment Your Child on their Character <p> Whether your child is a straight A student or star of the soccer team or not anywhere close to either that 's okay . Our children have their own strengths and weaknesses , and quite frankly , they will always be competing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter in various aspects throughout the rest of their lives . Instead of always complimenting them on their achievements or awards ( it happens by fault , we know ! ) , compliment them on acts that show true character the traits that actually make them who they are as human beings . Traits such as compassion toward others , loyalty , forgiveness , responsibility , patience , generosity and even resourcefulness are all traits that will serve children well in life by providing them with their own moral compass , or a way in which they will determine right from wrong . Children who have a strong sense of values are more confident in themselves and the decisions they make , helping them overcome adversity if it should come their way . Its easy to praise for high grades or a physical award and by all means , do n't  stop but making an effort to notice the small things your child does to help others or to simply be a decent human being may have even more of an impact in the long run . <p> Trick : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards when praising . In the real world , when our children use good judgment during a conflict , they will have to do so on their own accord , not because they will be rewarded for it . ( Lollipops for everyone ! We wish , right ? ! ) <h> Tip # 3 : Change Your Attitude <p> Adulting is hard . Add parenting to that and it gets even more ridiculously hard . When you have all of the stress of being an adult with full-on responsibilities combined with the responsibility of raising tiny human beings , its bound to get chaotic at times . Unfortunately , as parents , when we have the weight of the world on our shoulders and feel as though were breaking , how we handle the situation truly matters : all eyes are on us . Children mimic what they see , and if mom or dad come home from work and take stress out on the family or portray a negative attitude , children come to believe that that is how stress is to be handled . <p> Trick : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with open discussion or by making lists , working through the pros and cons . If you 've had a long day at work , show your children healthy ways of relieving stress such as taking the dog for a walk , going on a light jog , or doing something that you simply enjoy doing . Life is hard , but a positive attitude can make a huge difference for you and your family . <h> Tip # 4 : Let Go , Live , and Learn <p> A hard part of parenting can be letting go little by little , but its important that our children know that we believe they have what it takes to succeed in this world when they are no longer holding our hands . Sometimes this is best learned through trial and error , or simply giving our children the confidence to try tasks on their own . Trusting in themselves and knowing that they are capable of succeeding , or at least trying , builds self-confidence . When parents step-in too often , pointing out every wrong turn that might come their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of succeeding on their own , or helping every step of the way while giving the child very little freedom to make choices for themselves , children may begin to doubt whether they are capable of succeeding on their own . Its important when building resiliency that children trust their own skills . Provide mentorship and guidance , let them try the tasks on their own , and do n't  be afraid to see them fail . <p> Trick : If they attempt and do n't  succeed , take the opportunity as a teachable moment and discuss perhaps what can be done differently next time . Be sure to focus on the childs strengths and remain positive . Although they may not always succeed , the important lesson is that they bounce back . <p> Whether your children are infants or teenagers , its never too late to show your child through YOU how to respond to stress and adversity . While some children come by these traits naturally , others will have to work to adopt them , and seeing their parents model these behaviors will help them adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you may make mistakes and fail at times , you must pick yourself back up and you must push on . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Stephanie <p> Stephanie is a military wife , currently residing in North Carolina , and mama of two exceptionally curious little ones ; a rugged pint-size princess and a toddling Evel Knievel-in-training .

Yes , they are good for things like eating bugs and mosquitoes but let 's face it , they are flat out scary looking and give you the creepy-crawlies . You want the spiders in places that your children do n't  play like in trees , bushes , even corners of your house . <p> You can take orange oil- and put it on and around your- outdoor swing sets and playhouses to keep the spiders out . Simply- take the essential oil bottle and sprinkle it in the corners of the plastic play places where one piece would meet another .

Peppermint <p> Not only are mosquitoes one of the most annoying insects on the planet but they can also carry West Nile virus , Yellow fever and Malaria . Those are some pretty serious and , sometimes fatal , diseases ! Ticks can carry Lyme Disease , Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Powassan Disease . Those are also some very serious illnesses that no one should have to endure . With this peppermint trick you should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to kill them with a slap on the arm or leg .

Wasp Traps <p> Wasps can seem pretty aggressive if you accidentally come upon a nest of them . When one releases a distress pheromone the rest of the colony will swarm . This could be very dangerous to any child or adult , especially if they have an allergy . I mean , we all saw what happened in the movie My Girl- right ? 170546 @qwx580546 <p> Hint : Amazon says to put a little sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap but honey bees are also attracted to sugar water .

They are why we have fruits , vegetables , flowers , trees , etc . <p> " More than 100 agricultural crops in the United States are pollinated by bees . This means bees are important , if not essential , for the production of nearly $7 billion worth of agricultural crops produced annually in Arizona . Examples of bee pollinated crops include watermelons , cantaloupe , citrus and apples . Although some of these crops are pollinated by bee species other than honey bees , honey bees are the only ones that can be easily managed , moved around and are known to exploit a wide variety of crops . " ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you find yourself near some bees just leave them be . They are n't  that aggressive and are more scared of you than you are of them . <h> 4 . Marigolds <p> Yes , you read that correctly ! Marigolds give off a smell that most biting insects do not like so they steer clear of them . Marigolds are a fairly easy annual to maintain , even for the blackest of thumbs ! For those who do n't  know much about gardening an annual is a plant or flower you have to replant every year and a perennial- is one you only plant once and they bloom every year . Marigolds are great because they bloom in Spring , Summer and Fall . They do need full sunlight and can live in pretty much any soil . They look like a combination of carnations and daisies . Plant them around the places you spend the most time in the yard and they will keep the bugs away from everyone . Marigolds also attract butterflies , so the kids will love seeing them and chasing them around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great addition to any flower bed , or garden , and Earthcare seeds- are certified GMO free and packaged in the USA ! <p> For best results plant your marigolds the beginning of spring and they should last up until winter . Maybe even longer if you live in a warmer climate where there is virtually no winter . By the time they die it is already time to plant them again . <p> There are so many ways that you can repel bugs without using harsh chemicals ! If you keep dryer sheets in your laundry room , you can put one in your pocket or tie it around a belt loop and it will work like a shield . If you have lavender flowers around your home you can take one and rub it on your wrists and behind your ears and the nape of your neck to also keep bugs away It is amazing the amount of uses flowers and oils have , so go ahead and give them a try for yourself . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Ashley Gammon <p> Ashley lives just outside of Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies .

The jobs our kids are going to train for , are going to be largely technology-based . Additionally , many schools around the nation are now providing mobile devices to use in the classroom , or requiring that students bring their own .

Print out the rules and consequences for breaking them , and have your child sign their name in agreement . Discuss the rules often , and add or change if need be .

@@58756624 @7756624/ <h> 4 Critters You Should Stop Killing NOW ! <p> Summer has finally arrived , and many of us have been anxiously awaiting the warmer weather that accompanies it . As you spend more time outside , your odds of crossing paths with a creepy-crawly are exponentially increased . The general knee-jerk reaction of most people is to squash first , and ask questions later . Or run screaming . Or scream wildly while you psychotically hack away at the nasty thing with whatever tool is readily available to you , be that a book , your shoe , or your childs toy . When confronted with even a photo of a spider or snake , most people cringe and comment , " The only good snake/spider is a dead one ! " But what many people do n't  realize is how beneficialmany of these so-called vermin actually are for our ecosystem . Here at Daily Mom , we 'd like to encourage you to think twice before you go all Chuck Norris on any of the following critters. <h> 1 . Spiders <p> Okay , so anything with eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary , especially when they set invisible sticky traps at face level and hide inconspicuously inside of every nook and cranny . But did you know that one spider eats around 2,000 insects a year , including disease-carrying mosquitoes and flies ? In fact , world-wide , spiders are the single most important element of pest control ! Without spiders , our agricultural crops would be devastated by herbivorous insects , and we would be overrun with mosquitoes and other flying pests . <p> Ecological benefits aside , spiders , though spooky in appearance , are not as harmful to humans as they 're reputed to be . There are over 3,000 species of spiders in North America , and less than a dozen of those pose any threat at all to humans . The best course of action when you come across a spider outside is to simply leave it alone . Learn to recognize the few dangerous spiders , namely the recluse and the black widow ; if a dangerous spider is in your home , you can eliminate it by using the hose attachment on your vacuum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children play , do n't  feel guilty for squishing it ; just make sure to take great care in doing so , as these spiders are typically very shy and only bite when they feel threatened . The average home has over 100 spiders inside of it at any given time keep in mind that they are much more afraid of you than you are of them , and their main concern is eating all the bugs that are crawling around your house , not seeking your destruction . <h> Keeping Spiders Out of Your House <p> Obviously , we do n't  expect you to read this article and all of a sudden become the spider whisperer , scooping them gently into your palm , cooing sweet nothings to them , and releasing them into the garden as you discover them in your home . We like to think of ourselves as realists here at Daily Mom . We get that , ideally , youd like nothing more than to never come across a spider inside of your house , period . Spiders are generally less susceptible to chemical pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiders is not nearly as effective as you 'd imagine . Instead , try some of these chemical-free options : <p> Seal up any gaps around doors , windows , vents , and plumbing . Use a caulking gun to fill in any cracks that are allowing spiders into your home . <p> The recluse family of spiders are nocturnal , and are not web builders ; they love taking cover in piles of clothes , toys , shoes , or stacks of paper on the floor . Your best defense against these spiders is to keep clutter and laundry off the floor . <p> Spiders hate peppermint oil . You can make a mix of water with several drops of pure peppermint oil and liberally spray areas where you tend to find spiders in your home . Just be careful not to get the oil spray on children or pets , as it can cause irritation for sensitive skin . Other essential oils that are effective in warding off spiders include citrus , citronella , cinnamon , eucalyptus , and cedar . <p> Clean the perimeter of the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys , etc. near your house , as those are prime spots for spiders to set up their homes . <p> Place glue traps along the baseboards behind large pieces of furniture . Sure , these are designed for mice , but spiders often travel the perimeter of the room rather than cross a great expanse , and these traps are perfect for stopping them in their tracks . Just be sure to keep them out of reach of children and pets , as the adhesive is extraordinarily strong and messy . <h> 2 . Snakes <p> Snakes are probably one of the most hated and feared of all animals , but most snakes are totally harmless and are extremely beneficial to our environment ! In fact , of the 7,000-8,000 snakes bites recorded in the U.S. annually , only about five result in death ; compare that to the 4.5 million dog bites , 30-35 of which are fatal every year , and you can see that snakes are much less of a hazard than most people think . Snakes such as garter snakes , rat snakes , corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toads , and the king snake actually hunts down and eats venomous snakes like the copperhead and rattlesnake ! Without snakes , we would be quite overrun with mice , rats , and bugs . Most avid gardeners love finding the occasional garter snake in their gardens , as they scare off the rabbits that can destroy plants in no time at all , and they gobble up slugs and bugs that cause damage , too . <p> A healthy dose of caution is always advised around snakes of any kind . Educate yourself to be able to recognize your regions venomous varieties by sight , and learn in which areas they are most often found . Typically , the dangerous snakes are masters of camouflage , and blend into their environment seamlessly , so if you know in which areas to be on alert , you 're more likely to avoid contact with one of these guys . Snakes are generally very shy when it comes to people , and the old expression , " They wo n't bother you if you do n't  bother them " really does hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the snake ; seventy to eighty percent of venomous snake bites to people occur during attempts to kill the snake . <h> Avoiding Snakes <p> Even though the great majority of snakes that come into contact with people are nonvenomous , most people would prefer to never have to deal with them at all . While you cant totally eliminate the possibility of a snake around your home , you can certainly take some steps to make your property less inviting for them . Also , in the event that you do cross paths with one of these slithering creatures , there are a few good rules of thumb to follow to keep you and your kids safe . <p> Keep your lawn mowed . Snakes like the cover of tall grass . When hiking , stay on trails and out of the tall grass , and wear long pants . <p> Stay cautious and alert around rocks . Snakes love the hiding places available to them in a pile of rocks , and the heat from a sun-warmed rock attracts them . Many snakes crawl under rocks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large items . <p> Eliminate clutter from around your homes exterior . Piles of firewood , rocks , leaves , or toys make for the perfect hiding place for snakes . Its a good idea to quickly check inside of outdoor toys , toy boxes , and playhouses before your kids play . <p> If you come across a snake , give it plenty of space ! Snakes can move very quickly , and can strike up to half the length of their bodies , so be sure to circumnavigate the critter by several feet . <p> Eradicate pest problems such as mice and rats . If you 're overrun with rodents , snakes will not be far away . <p> Patch up any holes around your foundation , garage , and sheds . Even holes as small as a quarter are large enough for most snakes to enter , so ridding your home of these holes keeps snakes out ! <p> Yes , weve already said this , but the number one way to avoid a tussle with a snake is to leave it alone ! These animals go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do meet a person , they make every attempt to dissuade him from coming near . They 're not out to get you they really want to stay away from you as much as you want to stay away from them ! <h> 3 . Bees &amp; Wasps <p> Not much is as horrifying as being dive-bombed by an angry flying insect that has a mind to sting you . Bees and wasps can be found in great numbers throughout spring and summer anywhere that flowers grow . Drawn to all things sweet , they can also be a nuisance at your picnic or around outdoor garbage cans . But these winged insects are crucial to our environment , and too many are being swatted without a second thought . Every piece of fruit , every nut , and every vegetable you have ever eaten are all thanks to these invaluable pollinators . Bees not only pollinate agricultural crops , but they also provide for us the most delicious of natures treats : honey . And wasps are natures pest control , killing pest insects that destroy flowers and edibles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be quite painful , and for some can cause allergic reactions , when left alone , they are generally only aggressive when protecting their colonies or nests , and can easily live peaceably near your home . Mud daubers are the number one predator for the deadly black widow spider , along with several other pest insects , and are great to have in your garden . Paper wasps love to eat aphids , and hornets like to snack on houseflies . <p> In late spring and early summer , entire colonies of bees will sometimes swarm in clusters of thousands of bees at a time while searching for a new home . These massive clumps of bees are not dangerous ! Honey bees are only aggressive when defending their young or food stores , neither of which do they have with them during a swarm . If you encounter a swarm on your property , consider yourself lucky that you get to witness one of the neatest phenomenons in nature , then call a local beekeeper , who can quickly and easily relocate the swarm to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasps <p> We are sure by now you 're noticing a theme when it comes to dealing with these misunderstood creatures : give them their space , and let them be . Bees and other pollinators are quite possibly the most essential of all of earths critters . Other than the yellow jacket , these insects truly avoid confrontation with people unless they sense a threat to themselves or their nest . Here are a few pointers for coexisting with these guys : <p> Do n't  swat at bees and wasps . If one lands on you , calmly brush it off and walk away . Bees can only sting once , and to do so will kill it , so it would much prefer to not sting you . <p> If you notice a wasp nest , avoid it completely . Oftentimes , wasps choose pretty inconvenient ( for us ) places to build their nests , such as the eaves of our homes or behind fence posts in our yards . If these nests are in highly traveled areas , you 're likely going to need to remove it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , or you can use a spray product designed to kill the wasps on the nest . Just beware : any wasps not immediately killed will come after you in defense of their nest , so calling a professional who is equipped to safely remove nests is the best option . <p> When planning to be outdoors where bees and wasps are plentiful , avoid lotions , hair products , and perfumes that are strongly scented pollinators are attracted to the floral scent . <p> Keep garbage cans tightly closed . Yellow jackets are scavengers , and will be attracted to the smell coming from your trash . <p> Most wasps are highly territorial , and will not build a nest where one already exists . In early spring , you can place one of these imitation paper nests on your porch or under your eaves to deter wasps from building any new nests near your home . If a large nest already has been established , however , you will need to have it removed before the imitation nest will work . <p> Find your local beekeepers contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need a bee colony moved from near your home . Bees can sometimes nest inside of hollow walls , gaining access through small holes or cracks in siding , or inside of rotting trees . Its much more desirable for a beekeeper to safely move the colony than to exterminate it . <h> 4 . Bats <p> Admittedly , anything that only comes out at night and looks like it belongs in a vampire movie can elicit fear in even the bravest of souls . But bats are mighty bug hunters that can eradicate upwards of 1,200 insects per hour ! One of their very favorite snacks is the mosquito . In fact , bats are such good exterminators that a large bat colony can reduce the amount of pesticides required by farmers , keeping insect damage to crops at a minimum . <p> Many people fear bats because they can be carriers of rabies ; while this is true , the fact is that bats are far less likely to carry or spread the disease than most other mammals . Rabies affects bats so quickly that the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only less than half of one percent of bats carry the disease . Bats are nocturnal and generally very shy , which means handling a bat is nearly the only way to be bitten in the first place . <h> Fun Bat Facts <p> Bats are not blind as often thought ; they use echolocation to bounce high-frequency squeaks off of the environment around them , using the echo to navigate . This is also how they find their prey . They may look like they 're flying all willy-nilly , but they 're actually very strategic flyers and avoid people ( were too big to eat ) . <p> Bats are losing their natural habitats , such as caves and dead trees , which drives them to seek shelter in attics and old buildings . You can provide a bat house on a tall pole or under the eaves of your home or a building ; bat houses can provide a home for up to 100 bats ! Even a small colony of bats on your property will help keep disease-spreading mosquitoes at bay ! <p> All bats found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world play an essential role in pollination . <p> Bats are the worlds only flying mammal ! <p> Bats usually only have one baby , or pup , at a time per year . <p> A huge colony of Mexican free-tails in Bracken Cave , TX eat almost 200 tons of bugs every night ! <p> The saliva of vampire bats is being used to create an anticoagulant drug for beating blood clots in stroke patients . <p> The smallest bat is only about 2 oz , and the largest is over 2 lbs ! <h> Okay , You Can Squish These : <p> While it can be argued that every living thing , no matter how large or small , has a part to play in our ecosystem , some of these critters actually do more harm than good where human health is concerned . Hopefully , you have learned a few things about spiders , snakes , pollinators , and bats to keep you from automatically annihilating them when you meet them , but we give you permission to smash the following : <p> Roaches : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the filth they leave behind ( their shed skin and feces ) triggers allergies and asthma , especially in kids . Roaches are very hard to eradicate they can live for over a month without food , and for over a week without their heads ! A female roach can mate once and remain pregnant for the rest of her life , infesting your home with thousands of her offspring . Spiders , snakes , and bats eat these just sayin . <p> Mosquitoes : These flying pests are associated with more deaths all over the planet than any other living creature . From malaria and West Nile , to the newly discovered Zika virus , these bugs transmit diseases by biting and sucking the blood from their victims . Have pets ? Mosquitoes even transmit heartworms to our fur babies . Spiders and bats are the two biggest eaters of mosquitoes ! <p> Termites : These tiny ant-like critters are awesome as natures clean-up crew ; they break down fallen trees and stumps in no time . But in our homes , their natural behavior is extremely destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats : These guys are nasty , and their feces and urine deposits carry and spread over 50 devastating diseases . Plus , they are destructive , chewing through walls and wires ! Mice and rats are suspected as the cause of over 1/4 of all house fires for which the cause could not be identified . You know those snakes you are so afraid of ? They love eating mice and rats . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Cindy Haley <p> Cindy is the mom to Wyatt , the wife of Jason , and a lover of Jesus .

@@58756632 @7756632/ <h> Tips for Holiday Travel with Toddlers and Preschoolers <p> If you 're traveling this holiday season , you may be wondering how to ensure an enjoyable and stress-free journey for your family . Traveling with toddlers and preschoolers is a lot different from traveling with a baby , especially if she 's potty training or never taken a big trip before . Read on for some tips for creating a positive holiday travel experience . <h> Before You Go <p> 1 . Build anticipation . Building anticipation about a big trip and the holiday celebrations to come can help keep your child both excited and patient throughout your trip . Even before you depart , talk to your child about what you 'll be doing , what to expect , and who you 'll be seeing . Give your child her own bag to pack with whatever she wants to bring . If you 're traveling by plane and your child shows hesitation ( or even if she does n't  ) , consider reading a book about airplanes and airports together . If possible you can also take your child to the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustle and bustle , as well as planes taking off and landing . <p> 2 . Pack or plan surprises . If your child is captivated by new toys , consider buying some small gifts for the car ride . Wrap them ahead of time and let her open them one-by-one throughout the trip . You can also plan other special activities , such as a stop somewhere special along the way . <p> 3 . Pack ahead of time . Before you even begin to pack , make a list of everything you need to bring . Making a physical ( or digital ) list can help you remember other things you 'll need as you start to list important items . Start jotting down a list days or weeks in advance of your trip , so that you can add to it as you think of things . It may be helpful to make lists by bag ( your luggage , your purse , childs toy bag , carry-on , etc . ) . Then pack your bags and the car the day before . You can continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tailgate party " the day before . <p> Stay organized by packing ahead of time and , if traveling by car , use car organizers to stow childrens activities . This large organizer by One Step Ahead will keep all your childs things organized . <p> 4 . Pack your carry-ons wisely . Striking a balance between what and how much to bring in your carry-ons can be difficult . With young children though , its probably better to bring along too much than too little . If you 're flying , be sure to pack your carry-on with anything essential that would be hard to get if your checked luggage was lost ( such as medications or a favorite toy ) . Opt for travel versions of things that you will need whenever possible . <p> For example , we love the Totseat fabric harness that 's easy to pack and makes a great highchair when visiting family . Even if you 're driving , consider a " carry-on " bag for the car with snacks , toys , wipes , and a change of clothes so you neednt rummage through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy snacks . A bib and extra wipes will rarely go unused with a messy toddler so be sure to pack extra . <h> Getting There <p> 5 . Travel during sleeping times . Its often helpful to plan travel around your childs sleep time . If your children are toddlers and preschoolers , youve hopefully taken at least one big trip so you know how they sleep ( or do n't  sleep ) during travel . Still , habits can change as children grow so be as flexible as possible . If traveling by car , you may want to drive overnight or during a regular nap time if your child is able to sleep in the car . If traveling by air , you may want to choose very early flights in the hopes of the child going back to sleep on the plane , or alternatively overnight flights . <p> No matter when you choose to travel , there are things you can do to encourage your children to relax and catch some Zs . Bring along white noise CDs for the car or with headphones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in the car ) . Do n't  forget your childs favorite blankie or stuffed animal . For flights you may want to consider a lightweight blanket or sheet to pin up around your child to minimize distractions . <p> 6 . Continue to build anticipation . Just as you built anticipation for the trip before you departed , be sure to keep it going as you make your way to your destination . Continue to talk with your kids about the trip , the upcoming holiday celebrations , and family &amp; friends . Bring along books or movies about the holidays that you can read or watch with your kid en route . Talk again with your child about which family and friends you will be seeing and what activities he or she would like to do for the holidays ( build a snowman , eat Christmas cookies , sing Christmas carols , etc . ) . <p> 7 . Use airports and layovers ( or pit stops if traveling by car ) to your advantage . Let your child run around the airport and take in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you will be confined to your seats ( and the very narrow aisle of the plane ) . Take him into airport gift shops to window shop or maybe even select a toy . If you let your child get a toy , draw out the selection process as long as possible and then tell him he will get it during the flight to play with . <p> 8 . Do n't  forget about entertainment . Movies during a flight can be a great way to occupy kids . If you do n't  normally allow TV at home but do fly frequently , movies in-flight can make a great special treat for kids to look forward to . They may even stay more engaged with the movie if they know its only something to indulge in when flying . Choose holiday-themed movies to instill the understanding that the movie is a special treat . Similarly for lengthy car travel , you may consider allowing videos or games on a tablet ( just be sure its secure wherever you mount it so that it is not a hazard in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one by One Step Ahead ( which has been crash tested ) , can double for snack time and activities like coloring . <p> 9 . Put potty training on hold . If you 're traveling with a potty training tot , or one who has only just recently mastered the skill , rest assured that there 's nothing wrong with temporarily switching back to diapers . Regression during stressful situations like holidays is completely normal . Talk to your child about the potty throughout the trip and assure her that she can go back to big-kid pants once you reach your destination . Even if you switch back temporarily , bring along a portable potty in case your child insists on using one . If you stick with big-kid pants , be sure to pack plenty of extra outfits and be prepared for accidents . <p> For public restrooms , beware automatic flushing toilets which can scare kids and make them hesitant to use again . Throw a washcloth or carry around a small pad of Post-It notes to stick over the sensor so the toilet does n't  flush before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potty trainer to make unfamiliar public or plane toilets less scary and more familiar ( the BabyBj+rn Toilet Trainer is a very well-reviewed , portable seat ) . Lastly , be realistic . If the thought of an accident in the middle of a long airport security line is too daunting , just go ahead put your child in some Pull-Ups . Keeping you and your child as relaxed as much as possible is much more important during travel than powering through potty-training bootcamp . <p> 10 . Relax ! Remember : the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray . Build in flexibility to your itinerary to avoid unneeded stress . Do n't  worry too much about sticking to your schedule . Airports and car travel alike are stressful and if your child senses this , he may become more stressed , and you will too . Arriving at your destination late but with relaxed kids in tow surely beats getting there on time but with cranky kids ( and adults ) . <h> Once You Arrive <p> 11 . Childproof your accommodations . Whether you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a toddler you 'll want to childproof your surroundings as much as possible . Remind your hosts ahead of time that your toddler is at that curious stage where he may be tempted to explore fragile family heirlooms . You can help by bringing along portable baby proofing accessories like gates and outlet covers . At the very least , pack a roll of duct tape which can be used to cover outlets , tie up drapery cords and electrical cords , and secure cabinet doors . <p> 12 . Be flexible , within reason . Remember that the holidays are a special time to celebrate , spend time with family , and create memories . Try to do everything you talked with your child about . Try to be as flexible as possible with nap times and rules ( no TV , no sweets ) , but within reason . Do n't  be afraid to leave your company in the middle of festivities if your toddler really needs a nap or just some downtime alone with mommy or daddy . You know what is best for your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice from family . " Just one sugar cookie wont hurt " may sound reasonable unless you know from experience that your sugar-sensitive preschooler will be bouncing off the walls . <p> 13 . Do n't  forget about the trip home . Often in the chaos of getting some place we can lose sight of the return trip . Just as you did for your trip there , be flexible , pack wisely , and think ahead . Engage your toddler or preschooler by talking about what you did on holiday vacation and all the family &amp; friends you saw , and ( if applicable ) how you will resume potty-training and big kids pants as soon as you get home . <p> Remember : be flexible , stay relaxed , have fun , be safe , and take the time to enjoy making memories with your children and family ! 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Laura <p> Laura is a wife and a new mom living on the East Coast .

Write your requests in a polite and positive tone as opposed to making demands . <h> Be your own advocate . <p> It can be very helpful to include a statement at the end of your plan such as , " We request that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand so that we can give informed consent prior to any procedure " . <h> Review your plan . <p> Once you have done your research and considered the options above , written your birth preferences on paper , take the time to review them with your provider and birth support team to make sure you have communicated your preferences before the big day . <p> In the event of unforeseen circumstances , being prepared and having a birth team who knows your preferences can make all the difference in your experience and satisfaction with your birth . Keep in mind that no matter how prepared you are , labor and birth is unpredictable . This is why it is so important to have researched and prepared yourself as much as possible for any interventions and alternatives ahead of time so that you and your birth team will understand your goals , which is ultimately a healthy mom and healthy baby , and how you desire to get there . <h> Looking for Un-Maternity Wear ? <p> If you need to add some maternity clothing to your wardrobe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear for a short period of time , then head on over to Melody Lane for the best in regular clothing that is versatile enough to wear before , during , and after pregnancy !

@@58756654 @7756654/ <h> A Beginners Guide to Everyday Manners <p> Everyone loves the child who says please before every request and thank you after its complete . But kids are n't  born knowing what 's polite and what isnt. - One of your many jobs as a parent is to teach your children how to act in certain situations . In other words , you need to teach them some basic manners ! Once your child is old enough to talk and observe the world around him or her , its time to start with the basics . Follow our guidelines and you 'll have the most polite kid on the block ! So why is it important to teach your children manners ? Teaching manners teaches kids to be considerate and respectful of others and it teaches them that there are standards for appropriate behavior in different situations . This will set them up for success as they get older and they find themselves at a friends house or dare we say iton a date ! <h> 1 . Saying Please and Thank You <p> The very first piece of etiquette you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " thank you " . Children as young as 2 years old can start practicing this onewith a little help from you of course ! Even though they may not fully grasp why they 're saying these things , its oktheyll understand in time . And , its good to get them in the habit of starting to ask for something with " please " and finishing with " thank you " . That way theyll eventually say these things whether you 're around to remind them or not . <h> 2 . Greeting People <p> Just like " please " and " thank you " , properly greeting people is something you can teach even a very young child . Its important to teach your children that its polite to greet people when they arrive somewhere and to say goodbye when they 're leaving . Encourage your child to be sincere and to look people in they eye when they say hello and goodbye as well. - And while you 're at it , you may want to mention that its customary to shake hands when you 're meeting new people . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to shake their hand ! <h> 3 . Sharing <p> Along with saying " please " and " thank you , " sharing is probably one of the most commonly taught manners . Moms everywhere encourage their kids to share with their siblings and their friends from very young ages. - As your child gets older ( around 2.5 ) you can also teach them to wait their turn . Its not always easy for children who are naturally impulsive at young ages to wait for what they want , but its a valuable lesson to teach them that we do n't  always get what we want right this second . From waiting in line at the store to waiting to hear about a job they really want , waiting is something theyll have to do for the rest of their lives . <h> 4 . Saying Excuse me <p> Were willing to bet that you 've already taught your child to say " excuse me " if he or she burps at the dinner table . But do n't  forget about using " excuse me " for interruptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments to teach your child to say " excuse me " ! The next time your child wants your attention even though you 're already speaking to someone else , first say " excuse me " to whomever you are speaking with and then acknowledge your child and remind him or her to say excuse me before they interrupt you . And , next time you 're in the grocery store together and you accidently crash carts with another mom , use that as a teachable moment too . Politely say " excuse me " and then continue on your way . Your kids will surely learn from watching your actions . <h> 5 . Do n't  mumble <p> When children are in new or uncomfortable situations they may begin to mumble so as to not draw attention to themselves . But , its your job to tell them that mumbling can be seen as rude . Remind them that if an adult or other person ca n't understand what they 're saying , they probably wo n't get what they want . And , if your kids are older , you can explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid rude behavior whenever possible . <h> 6 . Knock on Closed doors <p> Children should be taught to respect others privacy and the best way to do that is to encourage them to always knock on closed doors and wait for permission before they enter . Be sure to show them the same respect : if they close they door while in the bathroom , knock before you enter ! <h> 7 . Practice good hygiene <p> Young children are n't  usually too concerned with personal hygiene , so these things will definitely take some time to become habits . Remind your children to cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze and to wash their hands after using the bathroom . If they 're a bit older , theyll certainly understand why its not polite to spread germs ! If they 're not old enough to understand though , just encourage the behavior so it becomes a habitand explain later . <h> 8 . Help Others <p> A major part of being polite is helping others when they are in need . From small requests like " please pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for an elderly person , its important to teach your child to help others without complaining . Explain to your child that one day he or she might be the one who needs help and theyll surely appreciate someone who is there to help them ! <h> 9 . Saying " May I " <p> There are many ways to encourage your children to speak politely and using " may I " instead of saying " give me " or " get me " or " can I " is another great place to start . Ready for a quick grammar lesson ? " Give me " or " Get me " are commands and it certainly is n't polite to command someone to do something for you , which is certainly something kids can understand . Remind them they do n't  like it when you command them to do something , and theyll be on board very quickly ! <p> The difference between " Can I " and " May I " is a bit less defined , but is there nonetheless . " Can " means something you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to do. - So , when your kids are asking for a snack , technically they can have one , if you permit them to. - Its probably best to save that long-winded explanation and just encourage your kids to say " may I " ! <h> 10 . If you do n't  have anything nice to say <p> do n't  say anything at all ! As children , we probably all heard that one many times ! Its especially important to teach your children to keep negative comments to themselves . As we mentioned earlier , developmentally kids are impulsive and they probably wont think before they comment on the physical appearance of another person . While its certainly natural to wonder about other people , teach your child that if they have questions or comments about other people , they should ask quietly or when youre in private . That way you wont stomp on your childs curiosity and you 'll be able to answer their questions fully . This is also a great opportunity to teach them that certain comments hurt other peoples feelings . <h> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by observing ! <p> Be consistent so your child knows what behaviors are expected and non-negotiable . Over time these polite behaviors will become consistent . <p> Remember , to keep your expectations appropriate for your childs age . Younger children are going to need more time to learn to do these things . <p> It takes several times of doing something for it to become a habit . So continue to encourage your child to do these basic manners and in no time theyll be doing them on their own ! <p> Be kind when you remind your child to say " please " or to share . If the goal is to be polite and kind , do n't  be rude when you 're encouraging kind behavior ! Itll embarrass your child and send mixed messages . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Krista <p> Krista lives in New York with her husband , their 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son .

@@58756655 @7756655/ <h> 7 Tips for Setting Boundaries with Grandparents <p> Youve just welcomed your first child and during all of the excitement of becoming a new parent , you 've failed to recognize that life has also changed for those around you . Those individuals who your husband and yourself call parents are now grandparents to your new baby . <p> How do you deal with the new responsibilities of becoming a parent ? Most new parents rely heavily on their parents for the first few months while they adjust to their new responsibilities . Grandparents offer up advice and suggestions to their children as they parent their new child . Some of their advice can be unsolicited though , so its important to set boundaries with the new grandparents preferably before the baby arrives . Oftentimes if boundaries are not set , it can affect the relationship between the parent and grandparent as the child continues to grow . <h> 1 . Scheduling Visits <p> As a new parent , its time to muster up the energy to entertain a constant flow of people . Though grandparents mean well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , at least for the first few weeks as you and your family get settled into your new roles . Once a schedule is outlined and well-practiced , let the grandparents know when a good time for a visit would be . Keeping a schedule as the child grows creates a great routine especially if talks of more children are in the works . <h> 2 . Consistent House Rules <p> Make sure that grandparents understand what rules are active in your home . <p> For instance , if your child has to eat all of their dinner before dessert , have a bath and story before bed or have TV restrictions , its important to ensure that both the parents and grandparents are on the same page . That way there is consistency and your child wont develop the " but grandma let 's me do it ! " mentality . <h> 3 . Religion <p> Regardless of whether your parents required you to attend church as a kid , it does n't  mean that you have to make your child . Its important for grandparents to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want your children to attend church , you will be the one making that decision . <h> 4 . Presents <p> Some grandparents are known to spoil their grandchildren . They purchase lavish gifts that may cross the line . Try suggesting that the money they 're spending on gifts go toward a college fund or toward something else that the child can benefit from long-term . <h> 5 . Holidays <p> You may have thought that spending adequate time with relatives during the holidays was difficult enough as a couple , but when a child is added to the mix , holidays become much more complicated . Consider sitting down with your spouse and discussing your holiday plans early so that you can share them with the grandparents.That way everyone knows what to expect , and everyone feels that they are getting to spend some time with you and the child . <h> 6 . Disagreement Management <p> There will be times when parents and grandparents will not agree on something as it pertains to parenting-styles , so its important to agree that those disagreements be talked about out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become little sponges , so its important to keep disagreements at bay around them so they 're not repeating it back to anyone . <h> 7 . Remember its just a Phase- Relax <p> As a new parent and as a new grandparent , there will be kinks to work out , but those kinks wont be resolved overnight . Itll take time to adjust on all levels , and its important to work together to make this new bundle of joy feel as welcomed as possible both with the parents and grandparents . As the child grows and as new children are added to the grandchildren posse , the boundaries will already be well established , so there will be less disagreements . <p> There is no doubt that when one becomes a parent and a grandparent , both parties involved are elated and want nothing but the absolute best for the child . That 's why its important to communicate and work together as a team.The relationship between a child and their grandparents is an important one . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Danielle Jones <p> Danielle resides in the Mitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit-bull dogs .

She knows her stuff ! - Read on to find out all that she has learned in her years as a breastfeeding educator and advocate as Shari busts the top myths about breastfeeding and shares her top tips on how to make breastfeeding work for you . <h> Shari Criso 's Top Breastfeeding Myths : <p> Myth #1 : A large percentage of our population just cant make enough milk to fully nourish their babies . <p> Fact : Our bodies were made to breastfeed and our species has survived for hundreds of thousands of years this way . It is actually UNCOMMON for a mom to carry a pregnancy , deliver a baby , and then just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense . There are some moms who may have issues with milk supply , but most of the time it is due to inaccurate advice to supplement with formula because of a " perceived " low supply issue instead of a real supply issue . <p> Myth #2 : That if your mom or sister couldnt breastfeed , that you wont be able to breastfeed as well . <p> Fact : I do n't know what happened with a woman 's mom or sister , but I do know that their mother 's mother , and her mother before that , and so onwere able to breastfeed or they would not be here . We come from a line of women that were able to produce enough and feed their babies because that was the only way . Although the ability to breastfeed can have a genetic factor , this is usually not the case . Most of the time the reason that the mom or sister was not able to breastfeed is due to reasons that were not medical issues , but rather misinformation or assumptions about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - That you have to have the perfect diet and lifestyle to make good and enough milk . <p> Fact : This is just untrue . If having the perfect diet , enough rest , not too much stress , etc. were major factors in your bodys ability to feed your baby then our species would have died off long ago . People throughout history have lived through some of the most difficult situations and still were able to feed . Although our own health does make breastfeeding easier , it is not critical in making enough or good " quality " milk. - A good diet will keep you healthy , but regardless of what you are eating your milk is rarely effected except in the most extreme cases . <p> Myth #4 : - Breastfeeding will change the shape of your breasts . <p> Fact : Breastfeeding itself is not the culprit. - Other factors that can change your breast appearance more than breastfeeding includes BMI , age , history of smoking , large pre-pregnancy breast size and number of pregnancies . <p> Shari Criso <h> Shari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Become as knowledgeable and educated as possible about breastfeeding BEFORE you have your baby . Trying to wing it after the baby comes or rely on the staff at the hospital to teach you could be a disaster and the reason why breastfeeding was not successful . <p> Tip #2 : Purchase what you will need to make breastfeeding more comfortable and easier especially in the first few weeks when you are first adjusting and it is usually the most difficult time. - You do n't  have to spend a lot of money to accomplish this , but assume that you WILL be successful and get what you need. - You may be able to get help with breastfeeding at no cost , since your health insurance plan must cover the cost of a breast pump " and may offer to cover either a rental or a new one for you to keep . <p> Tip #3 : - Make sure you are surrounded with support .

However , if only one of the brackets is clipped in , a single bracket will not hold your childs weight for long , and the child will fall forward suddenly face first into the ground . This is an easy mistake to make with this design , because there is a lot of travel on the brackets before the seat clips . It will sit fine , and the only real way to know if it is secure is to hear a click , and to try to pull the seat off the bracket EVERY TIME . Uppabay really needs to include either a visual cue that the latch is in place , or a better bracket system the brackets just slap on to the side of the stroller frame with no prevention of removal with side pressure . Watching my child fall face first into a concrete sidewalk is one of the scariest things I have ever witnessed in my life . Please do n't  let it happen to you !

Swimming , while known to be one of the best exercises you can do , does not come without its environment taking a toll on your body . Below are some hints and tips to protect your natural beauty while beating the heat and staying fit not only this summer , but throughout the year . <h> Hair : <h> Pre-Swimming : <p> Chlorine can wreak havoc on your hair due to the chemical oxidation of metals like copper and iron . To keep your hair from absorbing these metals there are a few preventive measures you can take : <p> First , wet your hair with water . ( This is always a good idea no matter how long you intend on swimming . ) Soaking it thoroughly will prevent your hair from soaking up chemicals . <p> Second , add a moisture rich oil such as olive or coconut oil to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from soaking up as much chlorine , lessening the drying effects , and also prevent your lovely locks from turning that steely green . <p> Third , run a moisture-rich conditioner through your hair before swimming . This also acts as a shield for the cuticles of your hair . <p> Fourth , if you are a serious swimmer , or intend to become one , consider purchasing a swim cap . Not only do swim caps cut down on drag , they can also be an extra precaution against the effects of chlorine especially for color-treated locks . <p> Note : If using a silicone swim cap , conditioners may make the cap slip off easily . Therefore you may want to try swimming with coconut ( or another ) oil only on the ends of your hair if you decide to use a swim cap . <h> Post Swimming : <p> There are many varieties of shampoos that can remove chlorine and any metallic residue from you hair to prevent the green tint .

The Institute of Medicine has stated that men should drink 13 cups ( 3 liters ) and women should drink 9 cups ( 2.2 liters ) of water each day .

You pull out your calendar , wistfully flip past the empty summer months pages , and get ready to fill up your days again . You know that even when the school day is over , your day is far from over . Once you hustle the kids in the door from the bus , grab them a bite to eat , and make them do a few pages of homework , next come the piano lessons , soccer practice , and Boy Scout meetings . Take a deep breath Mom . Let 's start the school year off right by learning how to juggle those after school activities with ease ! <h> Limit the amount of activities . <p> The first way to get a handle on all the activities is to simply limit the amount your children are involved in . It 's not only overwhelming to you , but having kids involved in too many activities at once is a recipe for disaster when it comes to balancing other aspects of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress can creep in , which can cause trouble sleeping and negative changes in behavior . <p> A good rule of thumb is to limit activities to one per child per season . Be sure the activity you and your child choose is something they enjoy , not something you push them to be involved in . <h> Create a master calendar . <p> Choose a central location in your home and hang up a large family master calendar . Here is where you should write everyone in the family 's comings and goings . At the beginning of each month , sit down and fill out the calendar . This is where you can see if there are any scheduling conflicts for you to iron out before that day arrives , thus saving you frustration . Keep it organized and updated . Consider color coding the calendar by family member . Have a family meeting and make sure everyone understands how to read the calendar . <p> For on-the-go scheduling , download the Cozi Family Organizer app for your phone . This free app helps you manage all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules to chores and shopping lists . The best part is that everyone in the family can access it , all in one simple place ! <h> Schedule regular family time . <p> While you are planning out your month , do n't forget to include family time ! A side effect of over-involved kids is the family as a whole sometimes takes the back seat . If you ca n't remember the last time your whole family sat down for a meal , something has to change ! Studies show that by simply sitting down for meals together as a whole family , kids do better in school , are less likely to become involved in destructive behaviors , are less picky eaters , and maintain a healthier weight . Make family time a priority and schedule it in first ! Try to aim for once a week , even if it 's only breakfast in the morning with everyone around the table . <p> Plan regular family nights ! The requirements are every member of the family is to be there and no electronics are allowed . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks . <p> While you 're planning out the month 's schedule of activities , do n't forget to account for meals . Everyone has to eat , and you should strive for the most nutritious options . Plan out your meals on a weekly ( or monthly , if you 're feeling ambitious ) basis , and make sure you account for that night 's activity schedule when deciding on a meal . Face it , you wo n't have time to make ravioli and marinara sauce from scratch when you have to shuttle 3 kids back and forth from ballet to piano lessons to a swim meet , all in one night ! Have an assortment of healthy on-the-go snacks available to curb over hungry appetites . Remember , kids ( and moms ! ) are happier , less cranky , and perform better when we are filled up with nutritious foods . <h> Pack the night before . <p> Make your mornings as efficient as possible , by planning the night before . Pick out outfits for the following day . Pack lunches , load up backpacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for easy access . This will decrease the amount of scrambling around in the morning , and prevent things from being misplaced or forgotten . There 's nothing worse than your son showing up to soccer practice with his sister 's ballet shoes . <p> Turn this into a teaching opportunity by having your kids help you plan and pack . Organization , time managament , responsibility , and everyday life skills will benefit your child more than twenty hours a week of violin lessons . <h> Create special car time . <p> You probably feel like your car is your best friend from September to June . You and your kids spend a lot of time together in the confines of the car , so why not make the best use of that time ? Make the car electronic-free ( no phone or tablet use allowed ) , and focus on having quality conversations with your kids . Try planning ahead by coming up with fun topics to talk about , or pick up Table Topics : Family to get the conversation flowing . If everyone is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Just make sure to properly utilize all those minutes spent in the car . <h> Use the help of others . <p> No matter how well you plan out these after school activities , something will overlap at one time or another . Consider creating a carpool with other families whose schedules line up with yours . Be flexible ! You ca n't be in three places at once , and if that 's where you are finding yourself , enlist help . Ask your husband , other family members , or close friends to pick up a kid if you find yourself in a jam . Do n't try to be supermom and attempt it all ! <p> The key to juggling after school activities comes down to balance . Just remember to keep balance in all areas of your and your kid 's lives . School work and family time need to come first , then the extracurriculars . If something is getting out of whack , re-evalute the situation and make positive changes . It 's more important for Junior to be a happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic athlete . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Dani <p> Dani lives in North Carolina with her two preschoolers .

@@58756698 @7756698/ <h> 10 Time Management Tips for Work-At-Home Moms <p> Being a Work-at-Home Mom is both a blessing and a curse . On the one hand , you have all of the flexibility of setting your own hours and spending time with your children . On the other hand , you are juggling so many responsibilities that managing your time can be a bit of a balancing act . <p> We know exactly what you 're dealing with . Not only do many of us run our own businesses and work from home , but we are all trying to find time here and there to write for Daily Mom . While not exactly experts , we 've found that todays time management tips have helped us move one step away from chaos and one step closer to productivity . <h> 1 . Commit to a Schedule <p> Working from home for many women means squeezing " work " into a much broader schedule . Heck , most of us do n't  even realize how much we do . Between the kids and chores , a lot has to happen before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify everything that needs to be done , so that it can get done . <p> With that in mind , find some time in your day in which you can be distraction-free.Then , sit down and write a master schedule that includes everything that needs to be accomplished . What is written , gets done.So , document every detail , even if it seems insignificant . <h> 2 . Plan the Work . Work the Plan . <p> While we say " write it down , " we recognize that everyone has a preferred medium for tracking their work . Whether its a yellow notepad , sticky notes , a digital to-do list or a calendar , find a system that works for you and USE IT ! <p> Only when you know what work needs to be done can you work through it . We like to think of it as planning the work and then working the plan . A little pre-work planning goes a long way and will save you time in the long run . <h> 3 . Knock Out the Big Stuff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monthly basis , and tackle those tasks in a single day . Those tasks might include paying the bills , sending invoices , monthly planning , scheduling resources , etc . <p> Do n't  plan to do anything else on that day , but those tasks . We tend to use either the last day of the month or the first day of the month . <h> 4 . Set Realistic Expectations <p> Be realistic about how much time you have available and how much you have to accomplish in that time frame . Your boss or customers will always push you to do more , but we 've found that if you can set reasonable expectations , everyone wins . <p> In fact , try under-promising the amount of work you 'll deliver within a certain time frame . Even add buffer time to allow for interruptions or family needs to creep in . Then , use daily goals to keep you on track . For example , if you 've promised an assignment to be complete within two weeks , deliver it within one week . Under-promise , over-deliver ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem like a no-brainer , but its worth repeating . As we said in the first point , you 've got a lot to accomplish before you can close your eyes at night , so its important to make the most of the time you have available . Even better if that time coincides with your most productive hours . <p> For us , we find that the hours our children are in school , nap time and after bedtime are the most likely candidates for getting work done . You may be an early bird who rises before the rest of your family . If that 's the case , grab a cup of coffee and get to work ! Or , if you 're more alert after lunch , then save your most difficult tasks for the afternoon . If you need to , coordinate your schedule with your partner ( or hired help ) so that you can get work done during your most productive hours without being interrupted . <h> 6 . Designate Time to Check Email <p> One of the greatest ways to waste time is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the same urgency as a text message or phone call . However , you can re-train those people by not responding immediately . In fact , designate specific times to check email and voicemail.However , do yourself a favor and do n't  check your email at the beginning of your " work day . " <p> For example , while you 're fresh and free of distraction , focus on assignments that require the most brain energy . Let 's say your day starts at 9 am after the kids have gone to school . For the next two hours , focus on your daily goals . Then at 11 am , check email and return voicemail . Once you 've worked through your task list , you can check email and re-prioritize your remaining time . <h> 7 . Turn off Notifications <p> On a similar note , turn off the audible notifications on your phone , tablet and computer . Go ahead and turn off the email notification for email on your desktop as well . The chirping and ringing sounds are not only annoying , but they will tempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clock <p> A great way to work within a specific time frame is to use a timer.If you work while your child takes a nap , your childs nap time is a great natural timer . If you 're working while your children are awake ( and you do n't  have the luxury of hiring someone else to watch them ) , then think of ways to occupy your kids for reasonable amounts of time and then utilize those chunks of time to knock out small tasks . You can literally use a timer to manage the time . <h> 9 . Take Breaks <p> Very few people can work 6 or 8 or 10 hours a day without taking a break , and when you 're a work at home mom , taking breaks is even more important . <p> For one , part of the reason you are working from home is to spend time with your kids , so taking periodic breaks will allow you to do just that . On the other hand , taking a break will allow you to clear your head and reset your focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find that you 're even ore productive . <p> On a similar note , when you are working from home , its very easy to lose track of time and to allow work to consume every free moment you have . If it gets to be a problem , you probably need to establish some office hours ( beyond our previous note about email ) . <h> 10 . Celebrate <p> Finally , at the end of every day ( and there should be an end ) , feel good about what you were able to accomplish and celebrate . There will always be more work to do so do n't  fret about what you werent able to complete . Simply clear your desk and prepare for the next day . <p> Remember that you own your time . Do n't  let anyone else steal it away from you . Just focus on the big picture and we 've found that usually , the details fall right into place . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Ashley Sisk <p> Ashley lives in North Carolina with her husband , two children and Kitty Paw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and a passion for sharing everything she knows .

Some controversy exists as to whether you should use glass or plastic bottles . Immunological cells in the milk are purported to stick to the sides of glass bottles , however the difference is probably negligible if your baby is receiving only some of his milk from bottles . If your baby is exclusively fed pumped milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 're pumping at work , you can store your milk in a travel cooler with ice packs or in a common space refrigerator . Although a bodily fluid , breast milk is not considered a biohazard and the CDC does not require special handling , labeling , or separate refrigeration ( 1 ) . <p> Milk that you plan to use within 8 days should be kept refrigerated , as opposed to frozen , so that thawing is not necessary . <p> For long-term storing , you can use glass or plastic containers , or plastic freezer bags made specifically for storing breast milk . Some plastic milk storage bags attach directly to a pump for easy handling . Breast milk storage bags are thicker and have a lining to prevent fatty components from sticking to the side . They usually also have a space for easy labeling as well as scales for measuring . Squeeze out extra air and be sure to leave room in the bag for expansion .

Shaking can cause important proteins in the milk to break apart ( 2 ) . <p> If your baby does not finish a bottle , most sources say it is OK to re-refrigerate once ( 3 ) . That is , to avoid waste you can put the milk back in the fridge and offer again within a few hours . After that , if your baby does not finish the milk , it should be discarded . As a precaution , it should not be kept longer since bacteria from the babies mouth has contaminated the nipple . <p> When you need milk from your supply , always use the oldest first . Do n't  worry if the oldest is weeks or months old . It is true that the composition of your milk changes over time to suit your growing babys needs . However , even older milk , as long as it has been properly stored and handled , is beneficial to your little one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk in smaller portions such as 1-3 ounces in order to avoid waste . <p> You can get extra use out of your pump accessories between washings by giving them a quick rinse , throwing them in a large ziploc bag , and storing them in the refrigerator until the next pumping session . <p> What to do if your power goes out ? Open the door as little as possible . Full freezers will hold their temperature for approximately 48 hours if the door is kept closed ( 4 ) . You might also consider taking your supply to a nearby neighbor with power . If there are still ice crystals in the milk , you can consider it to still be frozen . Most experts do not recommend refreezing the milk , although there has been little research on how repeated re-freezing changes the properties of breast milk . If you know ahead of time of a potential long power outage , you might also consider packing your supply in dry ice . <p> Does your milk smell soapy ? Most breast milk has a mild or slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells soapy . This may be due to enzymes in the milk digesting some of the fat and is probably fine if your baby accepts the milk . If not , scalding ( but not boiling ) the milk and quickly cooling prior to freezing may solve this problem if baby is rejecting the milk , although this may lower the nutritive content and is not ideal ( 5 ) . <p> If you and your baby experience thrush , you can still give milk pumped during the infection to your baby while being treated . After the infection has cleared , however , discard the milk as neither cooling nor freezing kills yeast ( 6 ) . <p> Left some pumped milk out longer than the recommended guidelines ? Instead of tossing the milk , consider using it for diaper rash , baby eczema , cradle cap , or any of a number of alternative uses . 170550 @qwx580550 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Laura <p> Laura is a wife and a new mom living on the East Coast .

A simple and gentle , " were keeping it small " should suffice . <p> Make sure the invitation includes all the relevant information : <p> Who the party is for <p> What its for Specify if its a birthday party or an end of the year ice cream party ( etc . ) <p> When it will take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and end time <p> Where it will take place Include the name of the place and the address <p> Any specialty attire If socks are needed for bounce house place or bathing suit is needed for swimming , be sure to remind your guests . <p> How/when to RSVP Consider including your email address for RSVPs or specify that a text is ok . Parents who do n't  know you well are more likely to text or email their response . <p> Avoid putting " Regrets Only " on the invitation . " Regrets Only " means that guests should only call you if they cant come . Inevitably there will be people who ca n't attend but who will not call to " regretfully " let you know they cant attend . But you 'll assume they 're coming because you have n't heard from them . So , to avoid any confusion , go with RSVP ! <p> Send out invitations approximately one month before the party . If the party is taking place during a busy time of the year , send them out earlier ! <p> Mail them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avoid having your child pass out the invitations at school . Invitations could get lost or , if someone is absent , your child might forget to give the invitation to the child when he or she returns . <p> Be clear when you address the invites . If all children in the family are invited , address the invitation to " The Smith Family " . If its just 1 of several siblings , ONLY put that childs name on the invitation . <p> Once kids are over 6 , think about whether or not you want parents to stay at the party . " Drop off optional " is always a good phrase to include on an invitation if you 're okay with parents dropping of their child for the party and then picking the child up when its over . <h> RSVPs <p> When your child is invited to a party , its a great time to talk to them about what it means to RSVP . <p> RSVP in a timely manner , in the way specified on the invitation . If your child is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her RSVP ! <p> If you need more time to RSVPmaybe you 're trying to figure out care for another child or you have something else going on that day tell the host that you 'll let them know by a certain date , and then be sure to stick to your time frame . <p> Do n't  ask to bring extra people , siblings , etc . <p> If its your party and people have n't RSVPed , give them a few days and then email or call them to see if theyll be attending the party . 170549 @qwx580549 <h> Krista <p> Krista lives in New York with her husband , their 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son .

@@58756714 @7756714/ <h> One &amp; Done : Busting Myths about Only Children <p> How many children to have is a very personal decision . Some couples immediately know they want a few kids , while others know they 're done after just one . In recent years , having an only child is becoming more and more common . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , families with just one child have nearly doubled since the 1960s . In fact , 1 in 5 American families have just one child . But , only children often get a bad rap . These myths about only children and their parents are completely untrue . <h> 4 Common Myths <h> 1 . Only children are lonely . <p> Yes , its true that only children spend more time alone than children with siblings . But , being alone does n't  automatically equal loneliness . In fact , studies have shown that spending time alone strengthens character and only children often know themselves better as a result . What 's more , only children have just as many friends as children with siblings do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative impact on the only childs ability to make friends . <h> 2 . Only children are selfish . <p> Several in-depth studies have been done on only children over the course of the past twenty years and research overwhelmingly agrees that only children do not exhibit more negative personality traits than kids with with siblings . Only children are not any more selfish than any other child . <h> 3 . Only children are spoiled . <p> Many people think that because there is only one child , that child is going to get anything and everything he or she wants all the time . This simply is n't true though . Any child can be spoiled and overindulged only child or not . Its all about the parenting , experts say , not the number of children in a family . <h> 4 . Parents of only children are selfish . <p> Parents of only children are often on the receiving end of criticism and scrutiny too . People may think parents of only children are selfish for only wanting one child and what they perceive to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is n't a happy one or that there are infertility issues . What people need to know is that having an only child is a valid family choice . Happier parents mean a happier family overallregardless of the number of children within the family . <p> - <h> Benefits of Having an Only Child <p> Not surprisingly there are plenty of benefits to having just one child . Parents with one child have more resources to devote to that child . This includes time , money , and energy. - As a result of greater parental resources , only children thrive . They often have higher intelligence and higher achievement rates than their counterparts with siblings , which may lead to only children contributing more to society than kids with siblings . Only children often have higher self esteem than kids with siblings . <p> Only you and your partner can decide how many children is the right number for your family . The good news is that there 's no right or wrong answer .

I do n't  agree with number 1 . Only children are , in fact , very lonely . I myself am an only child , and I feel I was deprived the experience of interacting with other children on a daily basis , which ultimately resulted in me being very awkward in social situations and not having very many friends . The few friends I do have have one or more siblings and are all very outgoing . My three cousins ( children of my mothers brother ) are also very outgoing and approachable because they had each other , but another cousin of mine ( child of my mothers sister ) is in the same boat as me . She felt very lonely and suffered because of it , only being able to make a single friend . Even now at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have high self esteem , as this article suggests .

I was an only child all up until I was old already going to college . And I loved it . Does a lot of my qualities now stem from that ? Yes both good and bad . But I love it all . And right now , I plan to only have my one child . But here 's the kicker , I 'm a stay at home mom , and my mom was as well and when that changed I was always with my grandma ..

I know everyones situation is different and not everyone even gets along with their siblings , but I was very lonely growing up and always wanted a brother or sister .

Many times there is a food allergy to blame . Other times , it may just be genetics . Often , babies will outgrow their eczema within the first few years of life . <h> Coconut Oil <p> It is extremely important to keep a baby 's skin moisturized if they are suffering from eczema .

@@58756731 @7756731/ <h> Moms Guide to Buying a Digital Camera <p> Many new parents find themselves buying a new camera within the first year of their babys life . With so many precious - moments to capture , buying a camera is not a purchase that should be made without addressing a few things . Our team at Daily Mom want to address your questions as simply as possible. - <h> 1 . Determine What ( and how much ) You Need <p> New parents often make the mistake of buying more camera than is necessary . Before spending the first dollar , you first need to ask yourself these questions . From there , you can ask for recommendations or check out what 's on sale . - <p> Why do you need a new camera ? <p> What is your budget ? <p> What 's your current experience level with photography ? <p> Are you willing to learn how to shoot in manual mode ? <p> What will you be shooting ? ( snapshots of your children , portraits , nature/landscapes , sports , etc . ) <p> What features or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - image stabilization , LCD screen , shutter speed , etc. ) <h> 2 . Megapixels ? <p> Years ago , manufacturers spent a great deal of time promoting a cameras megapixel capabilities . Cameras ( and camera phones for that matter ) have come a long way since then , and- most new cameras have at least five megapixels.So , the conversation is less about megapixels , and more about printing and storage . - If you typically print images at a normal size ( 4+6 , 5+7 and 8+10 ) , - then anything over four megapixels is sufficient . However , if you have any plans of enlarging your images ( 16+20 or larger ) , you may want invest in a camera that supports more megapixels . Understand though that higher megapixels mean more storage space required on your computers hard drive . <p> According to the Digital Photography School , the more important factor to consider when buying a camera is the size of the sensor . The image sensor used in point and shoot digital cameras is typically much smaller than the image sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that point and shoot cameras must use much slower ISO levels while producing a much grainier photo . Even entry level DSLR cameras will produce a fair amount of grain at ISO levels of 400 . Again , this does n't  matter so much if you 're printing small images or only plan to share your images on Facebook or Instagram , but its something to consider . <p> Before we go any further , let 's define ISO . Most simply put , ISO- measures the sensitivity of the light . In the days of film , you would have to buy different ISO films to handle various types of shooting environments . - The lower the number ( 100 , 200 , 400 , etc ) the less sensitive your camera is to light and the finer the grain. - Higher ISO settings are generally used to shoot in darker situations using a faster shutter speed . The higher the ISO you choose , the grainer shots you will get . <h> 3 . Kits and Other Gear <p> Many digital cameras can be purchased as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Camera Case or Bag <p> Memory Cards <p> Spare Batteries/Recharger <p> Lenses ( if you are getting a DSLR ) <p> Filters ( and other lens attachments ) <p> If you are starting from scratch , the kit is an easy way to purchase all the necessary items you 'll need to start shooting . Most retailers ( including online retailers like Amazon , B&amp;H and Adorama ) will bundle these extras with cameras and offer a discount when buying more than one item at once . That said , bundles may or may not meet your photography needs. - For example , if you plan on buying a DSLR camera and plan on shooting in manual mode , you may want to consider the quality of the items in the kit . Kit lenses - ( Canon EF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II ) - are typically considered cheap and are often upgraded quickly to lenses that can shoot at wider constant apertures ( such as the Canon 50mm f/1.8 ) . The camera cases or bags often offered in kits are generally low quality . <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away are : <p> Tripods <p> External Flashes <p> Reflectors <p> Be careful when purchasing these items in a bundle . Much like the kit lens , low market items are more likely to collect dust in your home than to be used . On that note- " one way to save a little money is to re-use accessories , especially in cases where you may be upgrading from one DSLR to another . <h> 4 . DSLR or Point and Shoot ? <p> This is probably the biggest question you have . Entry level DSLRs have become incredibly affordable in recent years . However , that does not mean that everyone needs to have one . And while your budget may allow for a DSLR purchase , if you are not committed to learning how to use your camera beyond auto mode , - we do not recommend purchasing a DSLR . Remember , cameras do n't  take great pictures , people do . That said , you 're likely still interested in the advantages and disadvantages of both , so here you go . <p> Size and Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can easily be thrown into a diaper bag ( or your back pocket ) . <p> Quiet : - so quiet that you may have to check the preview to see if the photo has been taken . <p> Auto Mode : - no extra thinking required , just point and shoot . <p> Price : - significantly cheaper than most DSLRs with many options under $100 . <p> LCD Screens : - ability to frame your shot using the LCD screen on the back of the camera vs. using a viewfinder . <p> Lower Image Quality : - smaller image sensors which means that the quality of the images they produce is generally lower . Again , not a big deal if you are only sharing your photos on social media sites or printing 4+6 photos . <p> Smaller ISO range : - ISO ranges are usually more limited in point and shoot cameras , thus limiting your shooting conditions ( unless you use the built-in flash ) . <p> Shutter Lag Time : - a lot of people become interested in purchasing a DSLR after trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Limited Manual Controls : some point and shoot cameras- come with aperture priority ' and shutter priority ' modes which are nice , but not easily accessible . <p> What You See , What You Get : - typically not adaptable in that you cant add lenses , filters , etc to most point and shoots . <p> With all of that said , the ball is in your court . What camera you purchase is entirely up to you . Many people find that having a DSLR in addition to using their camera phone is a good balance . Whatever you decide to use , we encourage you to learn how to use your camera to the fullest . Study the manual .

I hate drinking plain water , but was n't sure what type of tea to drink while pregnant . Not sure if you can answer this question , but do you know if red raspberry leaf tea is safe for women with a history of preterm delivery ? My 1st daughter was premature and I had contractions all the time during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters with her pregnancy- now I 'm having the same thing happen again with my second child . Ive been avoiding the raspberry tea because I 'd hate to increase my contractions or have it throw me into full-blown labor . Thanks in advance if you have any insight on this topic ! ! <h> Marie <p> Ginger and the nettle and raspberry teas you have mentioned as safe teas to drink are on other sites as dangerous teas to drink . Cause low birth weight or premature baby and so on . Please do n't  post on things you do n't  know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me start drinking red raspberry tea ( 3 glasses a day ) at the start of my third trimester . Not only did I go past my due date but I had an almost 8 pound baby . I also had an awesome labor and birth and I credit part of it to the tea . You 're telling someone not to post something on one site saying they " do n't  know " , but you got your information from another site that just so happened to say its dangerous . So that site MUST be right and this person must be wrong , because you say so ! That 's slightly amusing ! <h> venessa <p> Hi ladies , with my first pregnancy i had hired a doula and she recommended raspberry leaf tea or tablets to take which i chose the tablets . I cant remember how early on i started to take them but i was definitely on it on the third trimester . I ended up having a smooth natural birth which i believe raspberry leaf played a part . <h> Emet <h> Kay <p> You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if women are drinking it before 37 weeks as it is a uterine stimulator . That will go sending many women I to pre term labour and could end badly . Any thing from the mint family .. <h> Sravanthi <p> I love this post . I 'm too much addicted for tea .
