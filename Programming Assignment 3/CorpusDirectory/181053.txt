The orders were expected to have a significant and immediate impact on EPA activities nationwide . <p> Similar orders barring external communications have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent days , including the Agriculture and Interior departments . <p> Staffers in EPA 's public affairs office are instructed to forward all inquiries from reporters to the Office of Administration and Resources Management . <p> " Incoming media requests will be carefully screened , " one directive said . " Only send out critical messages , as messages can be shared broadly and end up in the press . " <p> A review of EPA websites and social media accounts , which typically include numerous new posts each day , showed no new activity since Friday . <p> White House spokesman Sean Spicer said today he had no information on the blackout . He said aides were looking into the circumstances . <p> Doug Ericksen , the communications director for Trump 's transition team at EPA , said he expects the communications ban to be lifted by the end of this week . <p> " We 're just trying to get a handle on everything and make sure what goes out reflects the priorities of the new administration , " Ericksen said . <p> Beyond what was stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on EPA contracts and grants wo n't apply to pollution cleanup efforts or infrastructure construction activities . <p> The executive director for the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , Jeff Ruch , said the orders go beyond what has occurred in prior presidential transitions . <p> " We 're watching the dark cloud of Mordor extend over federal service , " Ruch said today , referring to the evil kingdom in the epic fantasy , The Lord of the Rings . <p> Ruch noted that key posts at EPA have not yet been filled with Republican appointees , including Trump 's nominee for EPA administrator , Scott Pruitt . That means there are not yet the new senior personnel in place to make key decisions . <p> Environmentalists said the orders were having a chilling effect on EPA staff , many of whom were suffering from low morale . Trump and Pruitt have both been frequent critics of the agency and have questioned the validity of climate science showing that the Earth is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame . <p> Liz Perera , climate policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freeze all EPA communications and contracts should be " a major red flag for all Americans . " <p> " EPA was created to ensure that all Americans can enjoy clean air to breathe , clean water to drink and have their health protected from environmental and climate threats , " Perera said . <p> Staff at the Agriculture Department have also received orders not to release any documents to the public . <p> " This includes , but is not limited to , news releases , photos , fact sheets , news feeds and social media content , " read the email memo , which was obtained by The Associated Press . <p> Agricultural Research Service spokesman Christopher Bentley said the ban would not include scientific publications released through peer-reviewed professional journals . <p> " As the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's chief scientific in-house research agency , ARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public as we strive to find solutions to agricultural problems affecting America , " Bentley said , according to a statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people and locations " would still be available on its website . <p> AP reported over the weekend that staff at the Interior Department were temporarily ordered to stop making posts to its Twitter account . The prohibition came after the official account of the National Park Service , a bureau of the department , retweeted a pair of posts to its 315,000 followers that seemed to be a swipe at Trump on his initial day in office . The first was a photo that compared the crowd gathered on the National Mall for Trump to the much-larger gathering that stood in the same spot eight years earlier for President Barack Obama 's swearing-in . <p> Trump later falsely claimed that more than 1 million people attended his inauguration , which Spicer insisted was the most-watched in history . <p> UPDATE : <p> WASHINGTON " Dealing a blow to former President Barack Obama 's legacy on climate change , President Donald Trump signed executive actions today to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines , a move cheered by congressional Republicans and decried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the actions on the pipelines will be subject to the terms and conditions being negotiated by U.S. officials . <p> " From now on we are going to start making pipelines in the United States , " Trump said from the Oval Office . <p> Obama killed the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015 , declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy . The pipeline would run from Canada to U.S. refineries in the Gulf Coast . A presidential permit is needed to approve the pipeline because it would cross the U.S border . <p> The Army decided last year to explore alternate routes for the Dakota pipeline after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters said the pipeline threatened drinking water and Native American cultural sites . <p> The company developing the 1,200-mile pipeline , Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners , disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe . <p> The Dakota pipeline is set to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh air , and proof that President Trump wo n't let radical special-interest groups stand in the way of doing what 's best for American workers , " said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , the second-ranking Republican in the Senate . <p> In July , the Army Corps of Engineers granted the company needed permits , but in September the agency said further analysis was needed . <p> On Dec. 4 , the assistant army secretary for civil works , Jo-Ellen Darcy , declined to allow the pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe because she said alternate routes needed to be considered . Energy Transfer Partners called the decision politically motivated and said that Obama was delaying the matter until he left office . <p> Nearly 600 pipeline opponents have been arrested in North Dakota since last year . An encampment on Corps land along the pipeline route was home to thousands of protesters who call themselves " water protectors , " though the camp 's population has thinned due to harsh winter weather and a plea by Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault for the camp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late October campaign swing through Florida , saying : " We 're going to approve energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline and many more . " He listed the project among his top priorities for the first 100 days of his administration , saying it could provide " a lot of jobs , a lot of good things . " <p> Trump also supports the Dakota pipeline . Until last year , Trump owned a small amount of stock in Energy Transfer Partners and at least $100,000 in Phillips 66 , an energy company that owns one-quarter of the pipeline . Trump sold the shares last year as part of a wide-ranging stock divestment , a spokesman said . <p> A spokesman said in December that Trump 's support for the Dakota project " has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans . " <p> Environmental groups blasted the order as a bid by Trump to serve the oil industry . Trump 's nominee for secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , is a former Exxon Mobil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Gov . Rick Perry , owns stock in Energy Transfers . <p> " Donald Trump has been in office for four days and he 's already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be , " said Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club . <p> He and other activists said the fight against the projects was not over . <p> " It 's a dark day for reason , but we will continue the fight , " said Bill McKibben , co-founder of the environmental group 350. org and a leader of a five-year fight against Keystone XL . <p> McKibben added : " People will mobilize again .

At Grand River Center , he shared his thoughts about NASA during a question-and-answer session . Although Cain understands the fiscal challenges , he said there is " absolutely not " enough funding for NASA to complete all the projects it would like to complete . " We have enough money to sustain the efforts we have going now , " Cain said , adding NASA will need more funding in the future , particular as it continues efforts to eventually send people to Mars .

When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts . Both U.S. and Russian astronauts collaborate daily on the ISS . NASA recently severed ties with Russia except for the ISS .

There was a requested minimum $100 donation per person , and 150 people were registered to attend .

But I wanted to play football in college . My dad , who was a tool-and-die maker , was working with a gentleman whose son was a student at UD . They suggested I come up and talk to the coach . <p> The guest accommodations were in Steffens Hall , on the third floor in bunk beds . I guess I took the top bunk and my dad took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met several individuals and met the coach at that time , Owen Evans . The bottom line is I ended up coming here in the fall of 1964 . <p> How would you describe your football career at UD ? <p> I was on the two-deep chart . <p> Too deep to get into the game ? <p> No , I earned a couple of letters , played four years , started in a few games . But I was the third tackle . I was a long snapper one year . I took some pride in that . But you know what ? I played with some good athletes . We had some good teams back then . Made a lot of good friends . <p> I 'll tell you a funny story . My freshman year , I 'm on the football team . I 'm not really playing much at all . It 's the Homecoming game and we 're warming up before the game and we 're playing Central that day . We had a tremendous athlete here by the name of Dozier Jones . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dozier 's all pumped up and I 've got to go through this drill and he hits me with a forearm . He literally breaks my wrist . I do n't know it at the time , but I 'm on the sidelines , sitting on the bench , thinking , " My God , man , this thing is sore . " After the game , my folks were up here , we went out to dinner and my dad says , " You really ought to get that thing checked out . " So I walk up to Finley and sure enough , Dozier broke my wrist . Luke Faber , a doctor in town here , puts kind of a half-cast on this thing . So when I 'm done , he asks , " How did you break the wrist ? " I said , " Well , I 'm a football player at the University of Dubuque . " He 's asking me , " Well , what kind of a play did you hurt it on ? " It was difficult for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> See , I could tell you I was a great athlete , but there 's too many guys still living around here that would refute that , so I have to be honest . I was offensive tackle , I was a tackle . I was pretty offensive , too , but that 's ... <p> What about off the football field ? What kind of student were you at UD ? <p> I was a pretty good student . I say that with humility , but that 's the reality of it . I graduated cum laude . <p> How difficult was it for your family to send you to college ? <p> My folks were the paramount blue-collar ethnic savers . We lived in Roselle and my dad had bought a couple of modest home sites , and one of them he sold to pay for my education . <p> Let me give you a feel for what education cost back in 1964 . I think the gross tuition , room , board and fees was $1,600 . I had a $300 scholarship , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up modestly , but so did my scholarship . In my junior and senior year , I was a residence hall adviser . I took that money to help my parents . Do n't hold me to this figure because we 're going back a long time . For the four years , it probably cost my folks a little over $4,000 to send me to college . But I worked the summers in industrial situations . I paid for all of my incidentals . I paid for my books . <p> As a trustee , to what degree are you concerned about the cost of higher education today ? <p> Significantly . And we constantly think about it at the university and ways in which we can assist students in keeping that cost down . It 's a challenge for private higher education because we get no state funding . It 's a challenge . But we recognize it and we 're doing everything we can to try to increase our endowment to help offset the cost of education and think of other opportunities students can have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cost . It 's a concern ; it really is . <p> When you were a student , is there someone you considered a mentor , or someone who influenced you ? <p> I was raised in somewhat of a typical Chicago ethnic blue-collar family . A modest but humble , clean-cut family , Eastern European , Catholic , blue-collar . I was a first generation college student . My dad claims to have gotten to the ninth grade . I 'll give him that , whether he did or not . But that 's not a knock on him . He was a kid of the Depression . He was one of five children , whose mother died from cancer in 1930 . The Depression hits and for these families to survive , kids had to go to work . And so he did . Through a variety of programs and apprenticeship he became a tool-and-die maker -- a good one -- for the rest of his career . <p> When I came here , I was exposed to a wide range of backgrounds , and that experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Back in 1964 , Dubuque really was kind of on the forefront of diversity . It had a meaningful black student enrollment on campus . I was a fraternity member , and I think we had five , six , seven African-Americans in that group . So I was exposed to kids from out East who were from well-to-do backgrounds . There were kids like myself who were from modest backgrounds . There was racial diversity . <p> You know , you rarely think about those things until later on in life in terms of how it formulated your thinking . <p> But the thing here was that the people were so good , loyal , humble and dedicated . I 'm talking about the faculty that received modest compensation . I can think about the woman that cleaned the dormitory I lived in my freshman year , her name was Jeannie . I could n't tell you her last name . She invited a bunch of us over to her house for dinner on a Sunday night . This is what I 'm talking about . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of financial resources , but they were just good , dedicated , loyal people . People that were making a difference in a very quiet way . And that really stuck with me over the course of time . <p> People say , " Why do you have this passion for the University of Dubuque ? " I graduated in May of 1968 . I had a job offer from Arthur Andersen , which at that time was a pre-eminent accounting firm . I went to work for them . <p> The first thing they did was send you to their staff office home training school . Early on , you had to go around your group and talk about where you went to school . I 'm there with people from much more prominent schools . They came to me and said , " Where are you from ? " I said , " The University of Dubuque . " You could see this look from them -- kind of , " Where ? Who ? What ? " And it just stuck with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn it , some day if I could ever right that , I 'm going to do it . " Maybe that 's a little melodramatic , but ... No one knew Dubuque or the University of Dubuque . <p> About 1973 , I went to work for a small publicly held heat-treating company by the name of Lindberg Corp. , which had plants across the country . I worked for a gentleman by the name of Frank Waldeck , who was my mentor . He was a Notre Dame grad . He taught me so many things . It 's hard to describe when you have someone who kind of helps you out . He would take me to bank meetings , not because I added anything to the meeting , but just to help me out and train me . <p> In 1980 , I was recruited to come down to Columbus , Ohio , and join ADS ( Advanced Drainage Systems ) as their chief financial officer . I worked with another guy named Frank . Frank Eck . And he also graduated from Notre Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you go back to the Notre Dame campus , you 'll see his name in a lot of areas . The baseball stadium . The law school . The engineering scholarships . <p> The rest is history . When I joined the company in 1980 , our sales were about $55 million , today they 're $1.1 billion . There was just kind of that progression of what happened . I 've had a tremendous career . <p> I understand that you have about 3,400 employees at ADS , at 76 facilities . And I hear that not one of them pays for their health insurance . <p> At the present time , that 's correct . We 've always had a paternalistic attitude towards our people . It started with the guy who founded the company . People ask me , " Why are you still working at the age of 66 ? " We have had so many contributions by so many people since we were founded in 1967 . We have a great culture . <p> Let me tell you something that 's really odd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ADS : I believe we have great prospects for continued growth because of what we represent in terms of the infrastructure needs of our country . Where we benefit -- not because of great strategy or design -- is you ca n't make pipe in China and ship it here and compete . So we have two oceans , either side of our coasts , that allows us to produce and compete in our country and provide the type of benefits and pay that we believe is necessary to have a reasonable standard of living . We live in a global economy , so does that always happen everywhere ? Not necessarily , but as long as we have that unique niche , we 're going to ride that horse as long as we can . <p> We are one of the few manufacturing companies in the Midwest that still offers an opportunity for somebody to come out of high school , join us and work their way up to a reasonable manufacturing position without having to go to college and yet have an opportunity to have his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize what he 's accomplished during his length of stay with the company . <p> I take that very seriously . I wo n't retire until I can be convinced that there 's someone who 's going to replace me that has that same value . <p> I hear that shows up in your management style and your accessibility to employees . <p> I visit every plant in our company every year . We have plants in Hampton , Iowa ; Oelwein , Iowa ; Eagle Grove , Iowa . I will get to every one of those facilities this year . We 'll sit down , we 'll talk , we 'll cook out . Our people work hard . We have good , clean plants , but you have to understand that the process involves a lot of physical labor in terms of heat , working with inventory , working in the dead of winter , working in summer . I just try to avoid the south plants in the summer . Other than that , we get around to them all . <p> Regarding UD 's turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that weigh on you personally ? <p> Significantly . Because I had this pride factor . I did n't want the school to go under . This was when John Agria was president . And John was a good person , but we were just going through a difficult period . And the decision was made to make a change , and Bruce Meriwether came in ( in 1996 ) after retiring as president of First National Bank . It was a very difficult time . <p> I remember one meeting . It got pretty boisterous . Somebody said , " Maybe we should just take the keys and hand them over to the state and say , " Hey , open up the Northeast Iowa campus of whatever . " But obviously we did n't do that . <p> But here 's a key story . We were so desperate at that point to keep the place financially viable . We had a board of trustees meeting . I 'm not going to name names , but there was a proposition at that time to sell off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to build -- I think it was a Walmart -- for a modest sum of money , maybe 400 grand . I said , " Wait a minute . If we 're going to sell off our heritage and our future for 400 grand ... This is crazy . " <p> And I 'm going to bring up one name . One guy who supported me in terms of not doing that was John Butler . John and I very vocally opposed that situation , and we beat that suggestion down . That was a key turning point in the school 's history . I am so indebted to John Butler for the leadership that he demonstrated in working with me and not allowing that to happen . I 'm telling you that was a turning point in the school 's history . <p> From there , things started ... Jeff Bullock took over ( in 1998 ) , several tumultuous years , we had to scale back the number of majors , and from there , it 's been a steady climb upward . <p> From my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were going well with ADS . I became president of the company in 1994 and then was made CEO in 2004 . The company continued to do well , which provided the financial means for me to support the institution . It 's been a passion for me . <p> I love this town . This is a wonderful town . This school was so important to my parents . My mom and dad loved coming up to Dubuque . My mom loved shopping at Roshek 's . Oh , my gosh . It was a big deal to go shopping at Roshek 's . <p> At the University of Dubuque , we have a history of not generating people of high stature -- they are teachers , ministers , people going out and making a difference in the world . They do n't have the financial means to pay back , but are making a difference in the world . That has stuck with me that whole time . <p> Do you remember what your first gift to the university was ? <p> Oh ... probably 50 bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I graduated . I 'll say $50 and I 'm not even sure they would even have the records in the development office , but it was probably something like that . <p> How would you say philanthropy has changed your life ? <p> You know what it is ? I feel like sometimes my wife and I have been so fortunate . I 'm married to a wonderful woman , we have great children , and she has supported me over the course of time and quite honestly , things have gone so well at ADS , I feel like that movie " Camelot , " where King Arthur said , " I stuck my sword in the stone and whoever pulls it out is going to become king . " I pulled on it and someone says , " Hail to the King . " Things just kind of happened . I would love to tell you it was through arduous strategic direction and planning . I was in the right place at the right time . I worked hard . I did what I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . And for me to deny that would be foolish . <p> And so as things have turned out well , and I 've been able to help the university . Every time I 've given a gift , it 's kind of like things keep going well , it 's like , " Wow , I can do more now ... It 's kind of like I cut the alfalfa down and it 's growing up again . <p> I went through some of our articles and the best I could piece together -- at least of the major gifts , not counting the $50 in the early years -- it 's about $72 million ? <p> You say that people often ask you , " Why do you give so much to Dubuque ? " <p> I 'm around people that spend huge amounts of money generational planning . They say , " I 'm going to get my estate plan in place so my grandchildren , great-grandchildren ... " Who knows what 's going to happen 150 years from now ? Some despot could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to do things now that I hope can provide the values for future generations that provide the strengths and the values that this country had 50 years ago , currently and hopefully in the future . My wife and I have provided for our kids and our grandchildren , but beyond that , do you have to have huge sums of money ? <p> I had no idea there was that much money to be made in drainage pipe . <p> ( Laughs ) Neither did I ! We are the world 's largest producer of corrugated plastic pipe . I work with wonderful people , I 'm telling you . <p> What 's happened to me is not just because of me . I work with absolutely wonderful people who day-to-day are doing things -- the responsibility I feel that there may be 3,400 people in our company , you take their dependents and spouses , there 's probably 10,000 people that are impacted day-to-day by the decisions that I make . I do n't take that lightly . <p> I came across an article from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor league ballpark ... <p> You know what ? I was na+ve . I said , " I 'm going to buy a minor league baseball team and move it to Dubuque . " It 's not that easy . <p> There are n't that many available . <p> Well , first of all , I ca n't buy a team out of the league in the Carolinas or wherever and just move it here . The Midwest League controls what can happen . So for me to bring what I would call Major League Baseball affiliation to Dubuque necessitates that I find some team eventually that 's available within the Midwest League that I can relocate here . The best chance this town had was when what's-his-name ... <p> Michael Gartner ... <p> ... wanted to do it . I have n't given up on the idea and at some point maybe we 've got to grow a Pioneer League . As I near retirement , that still is a focus I would love to have happen . It 's a dream . But here 's something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first step towards bringing baseball to Dubuque , and that 's through a Miracle League . That is a program where they build facilities for kids who have physical and mental disabilities . And they build fields so these kids can experience baseball . I would love to partner with the city and with some other folks in bringing a Miracle League team to Dubuque as a first step to perhaps doing something more . <p> You 're also still involved in Marietta College , as a trustee ? <p> My oldest son went to Marietta and had a great experience there . We 've supported them . <p> But more importantly , in Columbus , we 're very close to Nationwide Children 's Hospital , which was a key philanthropy that we 're involved with , along with , I would say , some traditional philanthropic efforts with our church , with Lutheran Social Services . But these are efforts that really help , when I say day-to-day things , food pantries and day-to-day needs of our community . <p> I also heard about a charter school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowledge Is Power Program ) . I 'm telling you a wonderful , wonderful program in Columbus that I 'm involved with . We are in inner-city areas establishing charter schools all the way from elementary to middle to high school to take kids who are from very difficult backgrounds , and the goal is to get them through college . I had a group of them up here last fall . <p> I heard something about that . <p> Linda was part of that . We brought 12 kids up here last October for the Central football game and we beat the crap out of them ( Central ) . Excuse my French . I 'm involved in that program . We 're strong supporters of it . <p> Linda and I are not politicians . We 're not at either end of the political spectrum . We try to avoid politics .

I mean at some point , you have to take a look and say , there 's fewer years ahead of us than there are behind us . What are we going to do with our legacy that makes a difference ? <p> What is your vision for the University of Dubuque ? <p> You know , we 've done a lot . I 've got some other thoughts on my mind .

Since then , Meyer has worked on reconstructing his leg swing , which he discovered was significantly different than the majority of NFL kickers . <p> " One of the things coming out of college was my swing was so much different than everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I had to go through a swing change . It sounds a little weird but it was actually pretty drastic . It took a long time to get used to it . " <p> Growing up as a soccer player more than a football player , Meyer said he adapted a soccer-like leg swing to his kicking style that produced across-the-ball contact rather than directly behind it . <p> " It 's not what coaches want to see , " Meyer said . " It does n't seem like a lot , but it was pretty drastic since I had been doing it for five or six years ; it took some time . I had gotten used to it and it worked for me . " <p> His new swing puts more impetus directly behind the ball on contact and the follow through is more downfield rather than sideways . <p> " It has made me more consistent as a kicker and has really helped my mindset as far as going forward with kicking , " Meyer said . " It puts more body into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid ball on a straight flight path . Before , I hit it really well but it was kind of off the edge and had a little draw on it . This has helped me straighten out the flight of the ball . I know if I hit the ball well I have the leg . It 's a matter of consistency . " <p> Meyer said his tryout with the Bears resulted in a sit-down with kicker Robbie Gould going over his tape and pointing out areas he could improve in order to get a shot in the NFL . Meyer took the powwow to heart and moved back to Iowa City , where he took a part-time job at the Coralville Hy-Vee and continued working out and kicking using the Hawkeyes ' facilities . <p> Meyer said he 'll take an all-business approach to the Titans but also realizes securing one of 32 place-kicking jobs in the NFL is difficult .

There 's no messing around . I 'm going in with the mindset I am going to earn a spot , but I try not to put unnecessary expectations on it . I hope I kick as well as I can and it can be the start of something .

@@36059139 @5059139/ <h> Maryland , DC attorneys general sue Trump over business ties <p> WASHINGTON " The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump , alleging he violated the Constitution by improperly retaining ties to his sprawling global business empire and by accepting foreign payments while in office . <p> Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh joined District counterpart Karl Racine at a news conference in the nation 's capital , saying the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in neighboring Maryland . Much of the case is focused on allegations that Trump 's real estate and business holdings violate a little-known emoluments clause of the Constitution . The provision bars the president and other government employees from accepting foreign gifts and payments without congressional approval . <p> " The president 's conflicts of interest threaten our democracy , " Frosh told journalists . " We can not treat the president 's ongoing violations of the Constitution and his disregard of the rights of the American people as the new acceptable status quo . " <p> Frosh called the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added it was unprecedented the American people " must question day after day whether actions are being taken to benefit the United States or to benefit Donald Trump . " <p> The Trump Hotel in the nation 's capital affects business in the Washington area and is part of the reason the lawsuit was filed , the two Democratic officials explained . They also said their action was non-partisan , and other state attorneys general , including Republicans , were welcome to join the suit . It seeks an injunction to stop what the two alleged are the president 's constitutional violations . <p> " We have economic interests that are impacted , but the most salient factor is that when the president is subject to foreign influence , we have to be concerned about whether the actions he 's taking " both at home and abroad " are the result of payments that he is receiving at the Trump Hotel , payments that he is receiving at Mar-a-Lago , payments that he is receiving at Trump Tower , payments that he is receiving in all of his other far-flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told The Associated Press in an earlier interview . <p> Frosh said at the news conference that Trump regularly welcomes foreign diplomats to his hotel and appears frequently at Trump establishments , " using his role as president to raise their public profile . " He added that the president continues to take money from foreign governments while in office . <p> The lawsuit also focuses on the fact that Trump chose to retain ownership of his company when he became president . Trump said he was shifting assets into a trust managed by his sons to eliminate potential conflicts of interests . <p> The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday . The president called an earlier , similar lawsuit about the emoluments issue " without merit , totally without merit . " <p> Lindsay Jancek , a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee , on Monday described the lawsuit as " absurd . " <p> " The actions of the attorneys general represent the kind of partisan grandstanding voters across the country have come to despise , " Jancek said . " The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is time Democrats end their efforts to delegitimize his presidency . " <p> If a federal judge allows the case to proceed , Racine and Frosh say they will demand copies of Trump 's personal tax returns and other financial information in court to gauge the extent of his foreign business dealings . <p> Trump 's unique status as both president and the financial beneficiary of his global business empire raised questions about the emoluments clause of the Constitution even before he took office . Trump and his attorneys argue the clause does not cover fair-value transactions , such as hotel room payments and real estate sales . <p> The attorneys general are n't the first to sue Trump over emoluments . Just days after Trump 's inauguration in January , the government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a federal lawsuit in the Southern District of New York .

In the past 15 years , metal roofing 's market share in re-roofing projects has tripled from 4 percent to 12 percent , according to a recent McGraw-Hill Construction and Analytics survey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for metal roofing products , and expect to see continued growth , " said Bill Hippard , president of the Metal Roofing Alliance . <p> Local roofers are seeing the trend . <p> " We 're getting more and more calls for metal alternatives , " said Richard Nienke , of Roofco Residential Roofing in Dubuque . " Basically people are getting tired of having to replace their roofs , deal with shingles going bad . " <p> The allure of metal roofing systems is their longevity and their durability . Proponents say metal roofs also have environmental benefits , can reduce heating and cooling costs and might lower the homeowner 's insurance rates . <p> " I 've talked to people who told me they 've saved 30 percent on their home insurance , " said Jamison Nienke , of Roofco . <p> For people who choose metal roofs , those benefits outweigh the costs : metal roofs can be double or triple the cost of using asphalt shingles , although proponents say that cost is negated in the long run . <p> While a metal roof can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ultimately cost roughly a third of asphalt shingle roofs during the course of 60 years , according to the Metal Roofing Alliance . <p> That 's why , Jamison Nienke said , many consumers choose their roof material based on how long they want it to last . If consumers are in a home they do n't plan on living in long term , they might be more apt to choose a shingle roof ; if they plan on staying in the home for decades or keeping the home in the family , they might be more apt to choose metal . <p> Metal roofs come in a variety of products , from large panels more familiar to commercial buildings to pieces that are designed to look like asphalt shingles . <p> Jamison Nienke said each product has its particular strength , and consumers simply choose the one they like best . <p> " Everybody has their own turning point . Some people want a long paint warranty , some people want something that is going to come with long transferability , " he said . <p> In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a quality asphalt shingle . <p> " I know there 's quite a few people going with ( metal ) . I would n't say it 's a hot trend , " McCarthy said . He said on new construction products , his consumers almost exclusively use asphalt shingles . <p> McCarthy said that while metal roofs proclaim to last longer , a quality shingle with a good warranty can provide just as much financial security . He said both materials have their pros and cons . <p> McCarthy said metal roofs are prone to sun wear and hail damage , repairs can be difficult depending on the product , and while many are not flammable , firefighters do n't like them because they are difficult to breach . <p> " I do n't feel there 's more advantage of a metal roof over a shingle roof , " McCarthy said . <p> Jamison Nienke , on the other hand , believes that once metal 's costs fall in line with asphalt shingles , the latter will become obsolete . <p> He said in the past five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of asphalt shingles has roughly doubled . <p> " ( Metal ) is the roofing of tomorrow , " he said .

This family business , however , has flourished while many competitors have gone under . <p> It 's surprising then that the business was created by a man , originally from Chicago , who had no real experience in the lumber business . <p> " It started as a local lumber yard in May 1953 , " said Mike Noonan , vice president of marketing . " It was founded by my father Ray Sr. and his wife Mary . It was like most lumber yards at that time that sold lumber , boards , fence posts and cement . Hardware was something you bought at a hardware store . " <p> Ray 's father was a meat inspector who traveled . Ray 's mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the family farm in the Bernard area . After World War II , Ray and his new bride Mary moved from Chicago to Manchester , Iowa . <p> " There was a shortage of building materials , as much of it had been diverted to be used in fighting the war , " Noonan said . " Dad could see a growing demand for housing with GIs returning home and wanting to build a place for their families . His father had always advised him to be his own boss and that a good living could be made in the area of food , shelter or clothing . So he started a lumber business while still working another job . " <p> The lumber yard proved to be successful , and Ray Sr. saw additional opportunities . <p> Cascade Lumber began contracting for the supply and erection of homes and farm buildings . In order to expedite construction , the crew began using roof trusses that were built at the lumber yard . <p> " The lumber yard would contract to build a project , " Noonan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lumber yard . The lumber was fastened together using a bolt and ring system . The trusses would then be disassembled , hauled to the job site and reassembled into the finished product . Needless to say a pretty labor intensive process . " <p> As the years passed , other methods of connecting the wood pieces helped speed up the assembly process . Soon , area lumber yards were calling Ray Sr. asking if they could buy trusses . Cascade Manufacturing was created as a separate division to market and sell the trusses to retail lumber yards . The year was 1963 . <p> The company soon began to expand into other markets . <p> " Dad was good at finding voids and then filling them , " Noonan said . " In the late 1960s the lumber yard began selling paint , cabinets and floor covering . Dad must have realized that in the retail game the woman controlled the purse strings . So while you may have gone to Cascade Lumber to buy lumber , you would find other things for the home . Generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling lumber . The home center of today was not a concept . " <p> It 's perhaps fitting that on the day Cascade Lumber opened , Mike was born . The business would be forever intertwined with his life , as well as his four siblings . Today , in addition to the siblings , a number of third generation family members are active in the business . <p> It has grown and continues to diversify to include cold-formed steel trusses and wall panel production and the establishment of a technology company and home interiors store in Monticello . <p> As the wholesale business grew so did the number of truss production locations . A second plant in Eldridge , was added in 1998 and in 2005 a third was opened in Pleasantville , near Des Moines . <p> The company has had setbacks along the way , including a devastating fire in 1997 .

Yet , these cycles have helped make the company more efficient . <p> " We found we could be more competent with two locations by making better use of our assets , " Noonan said . " We made better use of technology not just in the office but also in production . Designs produced by technicians in the office are transmitted to work stations at the point of assembly in the truss plant is one example . Sawing and assembly equipment is also automated . Process improvement and technology to better use assets were two important things in addition to others that we learned from the recent housing recession . " <p> For the business to have survived so long is a testimony to remaining true to its ideals . Noonan believes many businesses could benefit from their approach . <p> " To succeed you have to do what you say you are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many companies make promises , but they do n't always follow through on them . For example , if we make a mistake and it 's our fault , we 'll correct the mistake and make it right . <p> " Finally , how you treat employees is especially important . If you have a labor force that is n't satisfied with where they work , it will show .

" I think it 's a good process . I like the graduated licensing -- you know , that at a certain age they have to be home at a certain time ( and ) you can have one family member in the vehicle with you . I really think that 's a good idea because it helps teenagers learn to keep their eyes on the road .

That year , fatalities of drivers younger than 21 dropped to 149 deaths -- 105 fewer than the year before . <p> In Illinois , the laws were bolstered in 2008 after public officials grew increasingly frustrated over deaths across the state , they said . <p> " In Tazewell County , which is near Peoria , there were 15 deaths in a 15-month period , " said Henry Haupt , deputy press secretary for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White .

But D'Amico said the GDL laws , too , have reduced fatalities . <p> Despite a marked decreased in the number of teenage driver fatalities in each of the tri-states , Iowa is a state that could most reduce fatal crash rates among young drivers if stronger graduated licensing laws were introduced , according to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimates . <p> " All states , we believe , can strengthen their laws by some extent , and Iowa is actually one of them that could be strengthened the most , " McCartt said .

An additional 10 hours of supervised driving is required before a full license is granted at age 17 . <p> With more stringent graduated driver licensing laws , the insurance institute estimates Iowa could reduce its teen driver fatality rate by 55 percent . Only North Dakota ( at 56 percent ) and South Dakota ( at 63 percent ) could potentially reduce their fatality rates by a more significant percentage . <p> The institute made estimates by examining the rate of teenage drivers involved in fatal crashes per 100,000 teenagers . ( A full explanation of Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 's methodology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that increasing Iowa 's 14-years-old permit age by six months would lower fatal crashes among 15- to 17-year-old drivers an estimated 7 percent , while raising it to 15 years old would reduce fatalities by an estimated 13 percent . Raised another year to age 16 , the fatality rate drops an estimated 24 percent . <p> If Iowa 's permit age is raised to 16 , and the license age ( defined as when the teen is first eligible for a license ) is raised from 16 to 17 , the teenage driver fatality rate would be reduced by an estimated 34 percent , according to the institute . <p> Additional decreases in teen driver fatality rates would occur with more rigorous night driving restrictions , the institute reports . For night driving in Iowa , teens at the intermediate stage ca n't drive between 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m . <p> Tassie Crews said the nighttime restrictions are one of the things she likes best . " It 's like the license sets a curfew , ' You need to be home at this time , ' so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't ( get home ) , you 're getting a ticket . <p> RESEARCH : PASSENGERS INCREASE TEEN DEATHS <p> Teen drivers giving rides to teen passengers is a major concern for safety officials and insurance industry representatives . It 's also an area where the insurance institute estimates Iowa could improve on safety . <p> " The likelihood of crashes increases with the number of people you have in there , " said Patrick Hoye , Iowa Governor 's Traffic Safety Bureau chief . " The reason the restriction is there in the first place is when they do crash research , the more passengers in the vehicle for a new driver , the greater percentage of crashes . " <p> The insurance institute estimates that when teen passengers are prohibited from riding with teen drivers , the fatality rates for drivers ages 15 to 17 is an estimated 21 percent lower . The Iowa Department of Transportation states that three young passengers with a teen driver increases the risk of a crash by more than 300 percent . <p> With a school permit , Iowa teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without adult supervision . <p> Once an intermediate license is obtained , there is a six-month prohibition on transporting more than one non-family minor . <p> However , Iowa parents are allowed to waive that restriction . That exemption became law effective Jan. 1 , 2014 . <p> " Obviously it 's a convenience if you are picking up other people , " Hoye said . " You have to weigh if the convenience is worth the more serious risk of the driver being in a crash . " <p> D'Amico was surprised to learn Iowa law allows parents to waive the restriction . He said those restrictions have been one of the most integral parts of the Illinois program . <p> " That 's when most of the accidents are occurring , especially the fatal ones , " D'Amico said . " There are a lot of distractions in the car when you have a lot of kids . " <p> Both public safety and some insurance officials said Iowa has tried to strike a balance between convenience and safety . <p> " Parents still need to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morain , executive director of the Iowa Insurance Institute . <p> But McCartt said parents need to look beyond the convenience and recognize what the statistics illustrate . <p> " Part of what I wish is that , you know , policymakers and legislators , a lot of the burden falls on them to make the laws , but in this situation , I wish parents could appreciate the risks involved with teens transporting teen passengers , " she said . " It may be inconvenient , it may not make your teenager happy , but you have a lot better chance of your teen coming home OK if you 're not allowing them to go out with teen passengers . " <p> CRITICS : PARENTS , NOT LAW , SHOULD DECIDE <p> Not all lawmakers believe more rigorous licensing is an appropriate step for Iowa , especially in its rural areas . <p> In 2014 , Iowa Rep. Jason Schultz , R-Schleswig , introduced legislation that would have repealed Iowa 's 2013 bolstering of licensing laws . The measure died in committee . <p> Now a state senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow crawling bait and switch " created in " a creeping nanny state environment . " He said if lawmakers want to increase the age for driver licensing , they should do it all at once . <p> " Whether we should have that or not is up to the people of Iowa , but if we 're going to have it at 18 , I 'd say just sponsor a bill to have it at 18 and get it over with , " Schultz said . <p> McCartt said options exist other than just raising the licensing age . <p> " Requiring more practice hours is one , and especially strengthening the night driving and passenger restrictions , " she said . <p> Schultz , whose west central Iowa district is primarily rural , said parents in his district voiced frustration over the 2013 licensing expansion . <p> " I 'm standing on our family farm , 27 miles away from the high school that my daughter attends . If I were to leave here , pick her up and take her to a different event , or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just not hardly workable , " Schultz said . " The number of miles and the amount of time is simply much greater out here in western Iowa . " <p> Schultz said he does not intend to introduce additional legislation seeking to roll back licensing at this time . <p> The rural-urban divide over licensing is not restricted to Iowa . <p> From his vantage point in Chicago , D'Amico said he recognizes the differences . <p> McCartt said the institute recognizes the differences between rural and urban needs , but it nevertheless stands by its analysis of data that shows graduated driver licensing laws reduce deaths . <p> " We recognize that some of the ways to strengthen licensing laws will receive pushback , especially in rural states , " McCartt said . " Our role is to do the research and put the research out there . Parents have to balance these different considerations from a safety viewpoint . " 176240 @qwx376240

@@36059213 @5059213/ <h> Uber recommendations show company was ' out of control ' <p> SAN FRANCISCO " It 's clear from former Attorney General Eric Holder 's recommendations on how to fix Uber 's dysfunctional management that the male-dominated company grew huge without even the most basic procedures to prevent sexual harassment , bullying and other bad behavior . <p> The 13-page document from Holder 's firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP released Tuesday exposes a startup-turned-goliath that permitted debauchery , had few policies to protect employees and ran with little board supervision . <p> The recommendations , adopted unanimously by Uber 's board , show clearly that the next version of Uber , called 2.0 by CEO co-founder Travis Kalaninck , will have to be much different from the free-wheeling company that flouted regulations and disrupted the taxi business to become the world 's largest ride-hailing company . <p> After interviewing 200 witnesses , Holder had to make such basic recommendations as setting clear policies to protect workers from harassment , and that the human resources department get a better handle on keeping records and tracking employee complaints . It even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders accountable and requiring all employees to turn in receipts so the company can make sure expenses match its values . <p> The recommendations " definitely paint a picture of a company that was out of control and pretty chaotic , " says Elizabeth Ames , a senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute , a nonprofit aimed at advancing women in the technology business . <p> Holder also suggests that Uber change its written cultural values to promote positive behavior , inclusion and collaboration . The company should eliminate values that justified poor behavior , such as " Let Builders Build , " ' ' Always Be Hustlin ' , " ' ' Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping " and " Principled Confrontation . " <p> Holder also called for slimming down Kalanick 's job duties , shifting day-to-day functions to a yet-to-be-hired chief operating officer . Kalanick , in a memo to employees Tuesday , said he will take a leave of absence for an unspecified period and let his leadership team run the troubled ride-hailing company . <p> Kalanick wrote that he needs time off to grieve for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also said he 's responsible for the company 's current situation and needs to become a better leader " echoing comments the 40-year-old CEO made earlier this year after a heated argument between Kalanick and an Uber driver over pay was captured on video . <p> Uber 's board said it would review Kalanick 's responsibilities and reassign some to others . <p> Ames said the recommendations were strong but indicated Uber had few policies , and the ones it had were not followed . <p> She was surprised by one that sought more supervision from the board . <p> " It makes you wonder where the board was before , " she said . <p> The board unanimously approved the recommendations on Sunday , including a suggestion that a senior executive be tasked with making sure they are implemented . Apparently because of distrust of some leaders , Holder recommended that care be taken to make sure the executive " is viewed positively by the employees . " <p> The Holder investigation started after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February detailing harassment during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositioned by her manager on her first day with an engineering team . She reported him to human resources , but was told he would get a lecture and no further punishment because he was a " high performer , " she wrote . <p> The company released only Holder 's recommendations , not his full report , citing the need to protect employees who complained . <p> Uber also must require that managers immediately report discrimination , harassment or retaliation , and ensure that codes of conduct apply to offsite events and conferences . <p> Liane Hornsey , Uber 's chief human resources officer who started in January , said implementing the recommendations " will improve our culture , promote fairness and accountability , and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated . " <p> Holder also recommended adding independent directors and replacing the board chairman , co-founder Garrett Camp , with an independent person . The board currently has eight voting members , three from within the company . <p> Uber was also advised to make sure its workforce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest of Silicon Valley , with low numbers for women and underrepresented minorities .

Last week , the company fired 20 people including some managers at the recommendation of Perkins Coie , which separately investigated 215 employee complaints . <p> On Sunday , Emil Michael , Uber 's senior vice president for business and a close ally of Kalanick , left the company . <p> Under Kalanick , Uber has disrupted the taxi industry in hundreds of cities and turned the San Francisco-based company into the world 's most valuable startup .

Especially since he had no background in retail and , more importantly , had moved away after college . <p> " I was living in Chicago managing an overhead door company , but felt my ambitions were n't aligned with that role . I wanted to do more , " said Siegert , president of Betty Jane Candies . " I was moving up in the company , but even as I moved up , I was n't sure it was my future .

It was something I remembered from my childhood and I jumped all over it , realizing its potential . About six months later we bought it and I moved back . " <p> Betty Jane Candies began in 1938 , when Peter Kloston was visiting Chicago and heard that a candy company had closed in Dubuque . <p> With so many talented candy makers unemployed , he saw an opportunity . He opened a business in Dubuque and with the help of the experienced candy makers , developed the recipes that would make the business famous . <p> " They started on Main Street and had to make the candy in the basement because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Siegert said . <p> The building had a serving elevator there that would take the supplies downstairs . Betty Jane moved its retail business to several locations throughout the years , including the Roshek building and Kennedy Mall . <p> When they bought the company in 2011 , Siegert knew he had a lot to learn . <p> " I had clerked at drug stores in high school , but had never run a retail business or made any candy . The first year , I spent 40 hours a week learning to make candy and all the recipes . Candy making is a lot more difficult than I imagined . It 's not like making a cake . Even if I gave you the recipe for Gremlins you would n't be able to go into the kitchen and just make them . It 's a bit more complicated than just following a recipe . " <p> The next year , he started to examine how the company was being run . <p> " I began to take a close look at the business infrastructure and what we needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things were antiquated . Everything was on paper and in filing cabinets . We wanted to get all that on computer , and we knew right away we needed a point of sale system to track our inventory and our sales to get the data to make business decisions . <p> " We 've just finished our third year putting it all together and getting a good team in place . I feel very good about where we are at . " <p> Part of the change was relocating some of the stores . <p> One Dubuque location and the Cedar Rapids , Iowa , store were situated in malls , but foot traffic was on the decline . Both were moved to strip malls , where customers could park out front and quickly get what they needed . <p> As would be expected , much of the sales are tied to holidays .

I am not stopped . " <p> Cosby is charged with drugging and molesting Constand , 44 . His lawyer has said they were lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take the stand at his trial , but prosecutors used his deposition testimony " given in 2005 and 2006 as part of Constand 's civil suit against him " as evidence . <p> As they pored over Cosby 's words , the jurors appeared to struggle with some language in one of the charges against him : " without her knowledge . " The jury asked about the phrasing Tuesday morning , but Judge Steven O'Neill said he could not define it for them . <p> The jury is considering three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault . The third count covers Cosby 's alleged use of pills to impair Constand before groping her breast and genitals . <p> Outside the courthouse , Constand 's lawyers blasted the Cosby team Tuesday for releasing a statement from a woman who had been blocked from testifying at the trial . <p> Cosby 's spokesman , Andrew Wyatt , read the statement from longtime Temple University official Marguerite Jackson , who said Constand told her of a plan to falsely accuse a " high-profile person " of sexual assault so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her she had been drugged and molested .

" I have three friends for you to make you relax . " <p> Cosby later told police the pills were Benadryl , an over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine . Constand " an athletic , 6-foot-tall college basketball staffer " said they made her dazed and groggy , and unable to say no or fight back when Cosby went inside her pants . <p> The defense insisted Constand was a willing partner and said she hid the fact that the two had had a romantic relationship when she went to police a year after the alleged assault .

Along the wall are lockers and there is a large mural of a baseball field . Most importantly for the clients , there are flat screen TVs at each station . <p> Part of the appeal of Sport Clips is not just that they offer haircuts ; the MVP is its signature service . After your haircut you go to a massage chair and receive a massaging shampoo , hot steam towel , and neck and shoulder massage . <p> Thanks to a lot of marketing for the opening , the salon has done well .

They devote many nights and weekends to the business and in the summer and school is out , Katie has more time for the business . With two young boys , however , both make sure they have time for family . <p> " I wish I could devote more time to the business , but it is not a reality right now , " said Burgmeier .

Now , as part of a week-long apprenticeship push , he is visiting Waukesha Technical College in Wisconsin Tuesday with his daughter , Ivanka , as well as Acosta and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker . <p> " Apprenticeships are going to be a big , big factor in our country , " Trump said during his first-ever full Cabinet meeting Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great careers , jobs that do not require a four-year degree or the massive debt that often comes with those four-year degrees and even two-year degrees . " <p> Many employers and economists " and Republicans and Democrats " welcome the idea of apprenticeships as a way to train people with specific skills for particular jobs that employers say they ca n't fill at time of historically low unemployment . The most recent budget for the federal government passed with about $90 million for apprenticeships , and Trump so far is n't proposing adding more . <p> But the Trump administration , like President Barack Obama 's , says there 's a need that can be met with a change in the American attitude toward vocational education and apprenticeships . A November 2016 report by Obama 's Commerce Department found that " apprenticeships are not fully understood in the United States , especially " by employers , who tend to use apprentices for a few , hard-to-fill positions " but not as widely as they could . <p> " There are n't enough people to fill the jobs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Conor Smyth , spokesman for the Wisconsin Technical College System , where President and Ivanka Trump , Acosta and Walker were visiting . <p> That 's where apprenticeship comes in . <p> Participants get on-the-job training while going to school , sometimes with companies footing the bill . <p> IBM , for example , participates in a six-year program called P-TECH . Students in 60 schools across six states begin in high school , when they get a paid internship , earn an associate 's degree and get first-in-line consideration for jobs from 250 participating employers . It relies on funds outside the apprenticeship program " a challenge in that the Trump budget plan would cut spending overall on job training . The program uses $1.2 billion in federal funding provided under the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act passed in 2006 , said P-TECH co-founder Stan Litow . <p> " This really demonstrates what you can do with apprenticeships with existing dollars , " Litow said . <p> Eric Haban , 35 , started as a youth apprentice junior in high school and then completed a four-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state in the country to pass a law establishing apprenticeship programs in 1911 . At the school Trump is to visit Tuesday , Haban learned to be a machinist for LDI Industries , which makes hydraulic components and lubricating equipment . <p> " It really gave me a jump start to get into a field that I had no prior experience in , " Haban said . <p> Apprenticeships are few and far between . Of the 146 million jobs in the United States , about 3.5 percent " or slightly more than a half-million " were filled by active apprentices in 2016 . Filling millions more jobs through apprenticeships would require the government to massively ramp up its efforts . " Scaling is the big issue , " said Robert Lerman , a fellow at the Urban Institute . <p> Another complication : only about half of apprentices finish their multi-year programs , Lerman said . Fewer than 50,000 people including 11,104 in the militarycompleted their apprenticeships in 2016 , according to Labor Department . <p> The Trump administration has yet to spell out how it would close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would revolve around encouraging more partnerships between business and schools rather than increasing the $90 million the federal government currently devotes to apprenticeships . <p> " I want to challenge the assumption that the only way to move policy is to increase government spending , " Acosta said at the Monday White House news briefing . " We should measure success based on outcomes and not simply based on spending . " <p> Susan Helper , former chief economist at the Commerce Department , said it would likely require more than $90 million a year to cover the administrative costs of increasing the number of apprentices . <p> But Helper , currently a professor at Case Western University , noted that how federal funds are spent on apprenticeship programs also matters . Tax breaks might do little to expand the number of apprenticeships , since the major barriers involve the upfront costs of starting an apprenticeship program that helps groups of smaller employers and the community colleges often involved in apprenticeship programs . 176240 @qwx376240

" The gunman who shot a top GOP congressman and several other people today at a baseball practice outside the nation 's capital had a long history of lashing out at Republicans and once frightened a neighbor by firing a rifle into a field behind his Illinois house . <p> James T. Hodgkinson , 66 , wounded House Rep. Steve Scalise before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House majority whip . <p> In the hours after the attack in Alexandria , Va. , a picture began to emerge of an attacker with a mostly minor arrest record who worked as a home inspector and despised the Republican Party . <p> On Facebook , Hodgkinson was a member of a group called " Terminate the Republican Party , " a fact that seemed to take on new meaning in light of an account from South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan , who said that as he was preparing to leave the baseball field , a man politely asked him whether it was a Democrat or Republican team before quietly walking off . <p> Until recently , Hodgkinson ran a home-inspection business out of his house . His Facebook page shows that he was a fan of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent who last year made an unsuccessful presidential bid .

His most serious problems came in 2006 , when he was arrested on a battery charge . <p> In April 2006 , he was arrested on two counts of battery " one for striking a man in the face with a wood shotgun stock and another for punching a woman with his fist , as well as a count of unlawful damage to a motor vehicle for cutting the passenger seatbelt of the woman 's car with a knife . According to the court clerk , the charges were dismissed in November of that year . <p> Though there are no other legal problems listed in St. Clair County , which includes Belleville , since 2011 , Hodgkinson did come to the attention of local law enforcement as recently as March 24 of last year . <p> Bill Schaumleffel recalled that he heard loud shots being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Hodgkinson 's home .

He reveled in the borough , even as he moved far beyond it . <p> " Breslin is an intellectual disguised as a barroom primitive , " wrote Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett in their book " City for Sale .

Breslin was a sportswriter , bouncing between papers until landing at the New York Herald Tribune . <p> He became a news columnist in 1963 , and quickly found a story when none seemed left to tell . As reporters worldwide arrived to cover President Kennedy 's funeral , Breslin alone sought out the presidential grave-digger , Clifton Pollard , and began his report with Pollard having a breakfast of bacon and eggs at his apartment on the Sunday following JFK 's assassination . <p> " Pollard was in the middle of eating them when he received the phone call he had been expecting .

But his ambitious plan alarmed lawmakers who worry about ballooning federal deficits . <p> The plan would also reduce investment and estate taxes aimed at the wealthy . But administration officials said that action on other key tax code elements would ensure the plan would largely help the middle class instead of the affluent . <p> The White House has yet to spell out how much of a hole the tax cuts could create in the federal budget , maintaining that the resulting economic growth would reduce " if not eliminate " the risk of a soaring deficit . <p> The outlined changes to the tax code are the most concrete guidance so far on Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president owns this plan ; do n't be mistaken , " said Gary Cohn , director of the White House National Economic Council . <p> Cohn said Trump and his administration recognize they have to be " good stewards " of the federal budget .

Administration officials intend to hash out additional details with members of the House and Senate in the coming weeks for what would be the first massive rewrite of the U.S. tax code since 1986 . <p> " We know this is difficult , " Cohn said .

This would include deductions for state and local tax payments , a change that could alienate support from lawmakers in states such as California and New York with higher state taxes . <p> " It 's not the federal government 's job to be subsidizing the states , " Mnuchin said . <p> The administration has emphasized that the plan was focused on simplifying the tax code and helping middle class Americans . The median U.S. household income is slightly above $50,000 annually . <p> Still , the proposal could reduce the tax burden for the wealthy as well . <p> It would also repeal the estate tax , the catch-all alternative minimum tax and the 3.8 percent tax on investment income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal has yet to be vetted for its precise impact on top earners , as several details are still being determined . <p> On the corporate side , the top marginal tax rate would fall from 35 percent to 15 percent .

Mnuchin stressed that the change for small business owners " a group that under the current definition could include doctors , lawyers and even major real estate companies " would be done to ensure that wealthier Americans could not exploit the change to pay less in taxes . 176240 @qwx376240
