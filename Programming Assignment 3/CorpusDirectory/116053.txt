@@35037108 @4037108/ <h> An Evolving Market : A Look at Biosimilars <p> Published on 06 March 2017 <p> Brand-name biologics have been extensively used for the past decade without competition . Biologic medications have opened the door to new possibilities for personalized , targeted medicine , but as patents end and biosimilars begin to enter the market , new therapeutic possibilities are emerging . <p> Projected to save billions of dollars in U.S. health care costs , biosimilars are a highly anticipated alternative to some of the most expensive medications on the market . However , from ongoing patent litigation and legislation to complex development processes , pharmacists and the U.S. prescription drug industry are left to hang on the cusp of a revolution . The destination may not be clear , but a look at the development , recent legislation , and anticipated effects of biosimilars on the market and the profession is enough to make one fasten their seatbelt . <p> Produced by living organisms , biologics have a more complex structure than standard , chemically based medications composed of small molecules . The active components in biosimilars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ph.D. , associate director for therapeutic biologics at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , elaborated in the April 2016 issue of the FDA Consumer Health Information publication . <p> " Biologics are different from conventional medications , " Christl said . " Conventional medications are generally made from chemicals , or chemically synthesized , and therefore their structure can be relatively easily defined . Because biologics come from living organisms that are variable in nature , they are generally more complex and not as easy to define and characterize . " <p> Terry Seaton , Pharm.D. , FCCP , BCPS , professor of pharmacy practice at St. Louis College of Pharmacy , explains that with biologics , it is not only the end product that is complicated , it is the creation process as well . Medications produced by living organisms are not revolutionary , but in the case of biologics , the organisms genetic information is altered to stimulate production of the medication . <p> " With many small-molecule medications , like aspirin , the manufacturing process is relatively simple and not proprietary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of making them is extremely complex , and it is also proprietary . Manufacturers start with a line of cells and insert new genetic information into their DNA . Then , they culture those cells and grow them , and those cells secrete the medication . The process is time consuming and very controlled , and no one but the company really knows the exact details . " <p> While many European countries have already reaped the benefits of a strong biosimilar market , the first FDA-approved biosimilar did not hit the U.S. market until the 2015 introduction of Zarxio , a product of Sandoz Inc. , the generics arm of Novartis AG . Unlike generics , biosimilars are not copies of a brand-name medication . They are " highly similar " to a reference product ( the original , brand-name medication ) and produce the same biological effects as the reference product . <p> As is often the case with advances in drug development , the advent of biosimilars came with some initial hesitation . Differences in the immunogenicity of reference products and biosimilars created some concerns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to biosimilar substitutes . Concerns also have been raised about discrepancies between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of innovator reference products and biosimilars , which could translate to differences in efficacy and side effects . <p> While , in theory , these questions may have merit , the review and approval process for biosimilars has alleviated most concerns . Before a biosimilar is approved , FDA experts verify that the biosimilar functions the same way as the reference product and is of the same strength and dosage form . <p> " Patients can rest assured that theyll be able to rely upon the safety and effectiveness of an FDA-approved biosimilar , just as they can rely on the reference product that the biosimilar was compared to , " Christl said . <p> Seaton added , " I 'm confident that the U.S. regulation of biosimilars is good . Its solid . Biosimilars did n't  catch them the FDA off guard . They learned from the European experience . They have patients best interests in mind , and they are smart people . They are not going to approve products that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislation <p> Even though many drug companies began developing biosimilars in tandem with their reference product , only three biosimilars have been approved by the FDA Zarxio ( a biosimilar version of filgrastim ) , Inflectra ( a biosimilar version of infliximab ) , and Erelzi ( a biosimilar version of etanercept ) . Despite the low number of biosimilars on the market , key legislation has already been passed in anticipation of market growth . To introduce more price competition and encourage innovation in the biologics market , President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPAC Act ) into law on March 23 , 2010 . This law provides an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars . <p> Similarly , in June 2016 , Missouri Governor Jay Nixon signed legislation critical for the substitution of interchangeable biologic medicines . Jim Greenwood , Biotechnology Innovation Organization ( BIO ) president and chief executive officer , commented in a BIO press release published in June 2016 . <p> Missouri is one of 20 states with laws allowing pharmacists to substitute an interchangeable biosimilar without a prescribing physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference products , which in most cases requires a new prescription . For some , this requirement presents an obstacle . <p> " The challenge , in many cases , is that biosimilars may not be automatically substitutable , " explained Adam Kautzner 01 , Pharm.D. , vice president of formulary and drug trend solutions at Express Scripts Inc . " Youll have to get a new prescription for the biosimilar product . " <p> For others , the substitution of a biosimilar warrants the involvement of the prescribing physician . <p> " The prescriber should know when medications are being substituted , " Seaton said . " With biologics and biosimilars , the effect that people get can be more variable , and the diseases that are being treated are more serious . Both the physician and pharmacist need to know what is happening with the patient . " <p> The Cost of Competition <p> The high cost of biologic medications is a major issue for many patients . With the introduction of biosimilars into the market , patients are afforded treatment options at a lower cost . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrons disease cost more than any other disease state , " said Kautzner . " From an overall payer perspective , more competition in the market will cause the cost to come down , especially if there is a directly competing biosimilar . " <p> The added bonus of a rise in biosimilars is the innovation that accompanies competition . Encouraging manufacturers to innovate not only increases physician and patient treatment options , but it also increases patient access to these new innovations . More cost-effective biosimilars create a financial opportunity to invest in new treatment options . <p> Impact on the Profession <p> In the next few years , biosimilars have the opportunity to create significant health care savings . For the biosimilars market to grow and remain stable , policy makers , manufacturers , physicians , pharmacists , patients and payers will have to work together . Strong competition in the market begins with cooperative legislation both at the national and state levels . Legislation encouraging physicians to prescribe biosimilars , comparable to laws that promote generic prescribing , is a likely approach . Policymakers are also focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri Senate Bill 875 . <p> The components that make for a sustainable biosimilar market are just as complex as the molecular structure of the medications , and pharmacists are sure to play an integral role . The exclusivity of the current biosimilar market has affected pharmacists working in hospital settings the most . Community pharmacists will play a different , but equally important role . <p> As legislation continues to be passed regarding the interchangeability of biosimilars , community pharmacists will be working with physicians and payers to make decisions regarding what biosimilars should be prescribed . Pharmacists are already the liaison between patients and payers . With the advent of biologics and biosimilars , interactions between pharmacists and payers will become more frequent and complex . <p> Teaching for the Future <p> Community pharmacists will also play a critical role in patient education . Despite most biologic medications being administered in a hospital or clinic , community pharmacists are often the most accessible source of health care information . Pharmacists will be required to provide information and education to patients receiving biologic treatments , even though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you become a pharmacist , your learning never ends , " Seaton explained . " Biologics and biosimilars are great examples of how pharmacists have to keep up with drug development . These medications are new , so we have to learn about them to properly educate our patients . The patient may be receiving their biosimilar from a specialty pharmacy , but they are filling the rest of their medications in their regular pharmacy . That pharmacist has to be a resource for the patient . " <p> The changing landscape of biologics and biosimilars will also inform the way institutions like St. Louis College of Pharmacy educate the next generation of pharmacists . <p> " We are obligated to teach students for the future , " Seaton said . " The work we do in the classroom may not always seem practical , but we are aiming at a target that is not today . We have to equip students with practical knowledge as well as a framework of understanding that allows them to learn and remain at the forefront of the profession . " <p> The development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pharmacy is a collection of intertwined issues . Pharmacists will continue to be a critical link , ensuring patients receive optimal benefit from these therapies .

@@35037130 @4037130/ <h> An Innovative Approach to Chemistry Education <p> Published on 09 March 2017 <p> When presented with the opportunity to rethink St. Louis College of Pharmacys chemistry curriculum to better prepare their students , Ehren Bucholtz , Ph.D. , associate professor of organic chemistry , and Benjamin Barth , Ph.D. , assistant professor of organic chemistry , were eager to accept the challenge . <p> " We were encouraged to do new things , to make something unique , something to be proud of , " Bucholtz said . " This allowed us to focus on tailoring the curriculum to our students . " <p> With support from Kimberly Kilgore , Ph.D. , dean of the School of Arts and Sciences , Bucholtz and Barth set out to tackle some of the challenges that often hinder students success . <h> Improving the Curriculum <p> " Previously , we taught chemistry the same way they do at the majority of schools one year of general chemistry followed by one year of organic chemistry , " Barth said . " The problem is , there is often a drastic difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter our program . Some of our students have already taken two years of chemistry in high school , while others only have the opportunity to take one semester . " <p> Just as students have a wide variety of chemistry backgrounds , they also tend to have varied math backgrounds . <p> " It is very difficult for students to learn math and chemistry principles simultaneously , " Bucholtz noted . " What we have found is students are either very comfortable with the mathematics and not necessarily the chemistry principles the math is trying to explain , or they do not have an advanced math background coming into college chemistry , so they become overwhelmed by both the math and the chemistry . " <h> A Unique , Student-Focused Solution <p> After more than a year of analyzing existing coursework and researching alternative chemistry curricula , Bucholtz and Barth came up with an innovative solution that would strengthen the focus on key chemistry concepts throughout the program . <p> " We call this approach a threaded chemistry curriculum because we are essentially threading the big concepts through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked backwards to say , where do we want our students to be at the end of the curriculum , and what do we want them to be able to do ? This helped us clarify the concepts that are most important to cover and refine the coursework to focus on biologically relevant topics that would be applicable to students in the future . " <p> One of their goals in structuring the new curriculum was to avoid thinking about the material as strictly general or organic chemistry . By emphasizing the connection points in the different areas of chemistry , students come away with a more complete understanding of how the concepts can be applied . <p> " In the threaded chemistry curriculum , we are able to cover an organic chemistry topic where it naturally ties into a general chemistry concept , " Barth said . " We introduce the topic the same way we would in general chemistry , but then extend that topic to go more in depth into organic chemistry . This way , students are able to see the connections in the material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program helps to ensure a more level playing field for students with a wide range of chemistry and mathematics backgrounds . <p> " Having students learn concepts that are new to everyone is key . It creates a better learning community , " Bucholtz said . <p> " Restructuring the curriculum also allowed us to move the majority of the calculation-based chemistry to later in the program , " Barth said . " That way , students have already taken precalculus , calculus and statistics before they get to chemistry material that requires heavy mathematical calculation . " <h> Encouraging Results <p> Implemented in fall 2014 , the threaded curriculum is still relatively new , but it is already showing positive effects . Bucholtz and Barth are starting to see encouraging test results that seem to indicate students are retaining the material more effectively . The new course structure also lends itself to faster intervention if a student is starting to fall behind , creating opportunities to connect students with academic support resources . <p> " Because we are getting into these organic chemistry topics earlier , we are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they are able to get help sooner , " Barth added . <h> A Leader in Chemistry Instruction <p> The College is on the leading edge when it comes to this type of alternative curriculum , and other institutions are starting to take notice . Bucholtz recently hosted a symposium at a national meeting of chemistry educators on alternative pathways to curricular change where he received positive feedback from peers and fellow institutions . <p> " There are a handful of other institutions exploring similar methods of altering the curriculum , but the vast majority are still using the same general chemistry , organic chemistry approach , " Bucholtz said . " Educators are starting to realize that chemistry needs to change because not everyone is a chemistry major . What we have done is create a program that is a good fit for non-chemistry majors who need to have a strong background in chemistry . We are relating the material to skills for our students . Other institutions are going to learn from us and start asking , what can we do to better meet our students needs ? "

Completing her bachelors degree in pharmacy in 1988 and her Pharm.D. degree in 1993 , Beckers experience as a student and professor at the College has given her a unique perspective and enabled her to form a deeper connection with her students . <p> Drawing on her multidisciplinary education , Becker has an amazing ability to add context and depth to her teaching , successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the biggest influences for me as a teacher was going through the curriculum myself , mostly because I know what is expected and how the students will need to apply the material , " Becker explained .

Since pharmacists dispense medications for depression and other mental health disorders , pharmacists are in a position to identify when someone has major depression or a similar disorder . However , most pharmacists in the U.S. have received no formal education or training at all in suicide prevention , even though suicides are now the 10th leading cause of death in America . Knowing the warning signs or symptoms of suicidality , often seen in patients with major depression , can help a pharmacist save someones life .

Pharmacists , physicians , nurses , and other health care team members may interact with patients at each transition , and new information , including tests , scans , lab results , and medication changes , may occur and needs to be shared . <p> Each care transition requires every member of the health care team to correctly communicate and properly educate each other and the patient to ensure that the patient receives the best possible care . Yet , when breakdowns in care occur , a patients transition of care can be mishandled and a persons health and well-being are at risk . In an effort to save lives and stop a sometimes endless cycle of readmission rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the critical link between health care systems and patients , they are medication managers who are transforming the spectrum of health care . <h> The Affordable Care Act Effect <p> While transitions of care can take place in any health care setting , significant attention is currently focused on a patients transition of care from hospital to home or outpatient facility . An alarming number of patients , especially Medicare patients , are being readmitted to the hospital not long after they are released . On average , nearly 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who were discharged from the hospital were readmitted within 30 days of their release , and 34 percent were readmitted within 90 days . " The elderly are the most common population to be readmitted into the hospital , " says Tricia Berry 94/95 , Pharm.D. , interim senior associate dean of pharmacy , interim chair of the pharmacy practice department , and professor of pharmacy practice . She and Terry Seaton , Pharm.D. , professor of pharmacy practice , along with other College faculty , have proposed researching transitions of care models , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Also , patients with certain medical conditions are more likely to have recurring hospitalizations , " Berry says . <p> Currently , the staggeringly high rate of readmissions is costing the United States health care system about $25 billion annually . In an effort to improve readmission rates , especially in Medicare and Medicaid patients , the federal government added a provision to the Affordable Care Act . The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) to reduce payments to acute care inpatient prospective payment system hospitals with excess readmissions . Beginning in October 2012 , hospitals whose readmission of patients within 30 days of release were higher than the national average saw withholdings of reimbursements from CMS . " The penalties from the federal government are costing some health systems millions of dollars , " Seaton explains . " They have started searching for ways to avoid the penalties by improving transitions of care . " <h> The Critical Link <p> In order to improve transitions of care , the causes for the high number of readmission rates must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonprofit organization that accredits health care systems nationwide , three types of breakdowns occur when a patient is discharged from the hospital : communication , patient education , and accountability . <p> " While a patient is in a hospital , its a routine process for members of a care team to communicate issues , but we have not had that same mindset when it comes to a patients discharge , " Seaton says . " We need to rethink our paradigm of communication . Were usually talking with patients who may not be the best communicators because of their environmental situation . They may still be sick and possibly overwhelmed or scared . We may try to communicate instead with a caregiver , but not every patient has one . " <p> To Berry , a key breakdown in communication comes from inadequate information available to long-term providers in the outpatient setting . " If information , especially information about a patients medication regimen , is n't properly communicated to the patients primary care physician or community pharmacist , a mistake could occur that sends the patient spiraling back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any medication changes , so they can update the patients medication records and help him or her understand what the medication regimen should be . " <p> Amy Drew , assistant professor of pharmacy practice , agrees with Berrys assessment . " Picture yourself as a patient in the hospital . Youve been seen for a recent illness , and your entire medication list can change dramatically . Youre given a sheet of paper that says which medications to start , continue , and stop . That 's assuming it is the most current piece of paper because that is what the patient will rely on . " Drew , who works at Mercy Clinic Family Medicine , a physician-based clinic , often follows up with patients on medication reconciliation and adherence . " When I call a patient to review his medications , I 'm using that same sheet of paper . As I go through it , the patient may just read off the paper . But what he really needs to do is go through his medication bottles and tell me what he s actually taking and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is potential for serious breakdowns and health risks . " <p> Just as proper communication with a patient is important , so is patient education and health literacy . " Not enough time is spent educating patients , " Seaton says . " It can be a lengthy and costly process , especially when patients have unique educational needs . That is why pharmacists are key , especially in the medication reconciliation process . Patients enter and leave the hospital with complex medication histories and medical problems and need the expertise of pharmacists . " <p> Jamie Pitlick , assistant professor of pharmacy practice , further explains the critical role of pharmacists . Pitlick , who works at Mercy JFK Clinic , a hospital-based clinic that serves patients who are uninsured or covered by Medicare and Medicaid , has seen firsthand the adverse effects caused when patients do n't  understand the medications they are prescribed . " I work with a low socioeconomic and low health literacy population , " she explains . " Many times a practitioner makes a medication decision , and the patient is told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I make follow-up calls with patients , they may tell me they were prescribed something , but they do n't  know why . My role is to help them understand , so they can get proper treatment and get better . " <p> " In a number of conversations I 've recently had , " Drew says , " patients share that they do n't  understand why they are or are not taking a certain medication . For instance , a patient told me he started taking a new cholesterol medication . He did n't  know why , especially since he did n't  have a cholesterol problem . What he did n't  understand was that the medication does n't  just treat high cholesterol . There may be additive benefits for him outside of lowering cholesterol . Pharmacists are in a great position because we have the understanding not only about the drug , but why it is the best choice for the patient . We can provide that linkage for the patient , which can make the difference between them taking it or not taking it . " <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved . " Prior to the recent implementation of CMS penalties , accountability for patient safety and quality really focused on inpatient care , " Berry says . " But with the new regulations , you see the accountability shifting . The primary care provider is no longer the one who is solely responsible for what 's happening in the outpatient environment . Now the hospital also has an interest in outpatient care . Were seeing the formation of accountable care organizations to bring together multiple providers across a health system , so they can work and communicate more successfully . " <h> Transforming the Spectrum of Care <p> Several transitions of care models are being implemented across health systems nationwide to reduce readmission rates and improve the quality of patient care . Many involve the critical role of the pharmacist as the health care professional who links the patient from hospital discharge to outpatient recovery and who can best educate patients on medication adherence . <p> Berry and Seaton have partnered with several health care and research institutions to create a transition of care model to improve readmission rates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pharmacists , both in the hospital and in the community . " The most important feature of our research is to connect the hospital pharmacist and the community pharmacist , " Seaton says . " Right now , those two entities do n't  communicate at the time of transition of care from the hospital to home and vice versa . " He continues , " When a patient is admitted to the hospital from home , the community pharmacist has this wealth of drug information about the patient that does n't  get shared with the hospital pharmacist . Its really the initial medication reconciliation . Our second most important feature is patient education and empowerment . Both in the hospital and also in a repetitive sequence in the outpatient setting there would be education focusing on different aspects of care . " <p> Berry and Seatons model includes a unique aspect for improving communication . " Many hospitals are shifting to electronic records , " Berry says . " However , they are not connected across health care systems yet . So an electronic health record , while visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians office or the pharmacy . We are proposing the use of a platform that would connect those systems , so inpatient and outpatient providers can communicate . This platform is critical in helping community pharmacists be better informed and provide the best possible support to their patients . " <p> Berry and Seaton are collaborating with Barnes-Jewish Hospital , Walgreens , and the Missouri Pharmacy Association and its Missouri Pharmacists Care Network . " This way , any pharmacist in Missouri could participate , " Berry says . " Both retail and independent pharmacies could take part in the education and training . " In addition , Essence and Aetna health insurance companies joined the collaboration to provide data analysis of health care costs . <p> Both are confident that their model can elevate the role of the pharmacist in patient care and improve readmission rates . " We are talking about a systematic change , " Berry says . " We are transforming patient care . " <p> Drew and Pitlick are also collaborating on a transitions of care model . As pharmacists through Mercy health system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to their respective clinics . " Jamie and I both practice in ambulatory care clinical pharmacies , " Drew says . " Were in the position to catch and correct medication errors with the primary purpose of improving patient care and the quality of care for patients . " <p> Both pharmacists took a proactive approach to being involved in collaborative efforts . " We saw an important role we could play on our health care teams , " Pitlick says . " We took the initiative and created these roles in our respective clinics . I learned a resident physician at my clinic was beginning a scholarly project on ways she could improve the way patients are cared for . She mentioned transitions of care , and I asked her what I could add . Together we agreed on what she and I would focus on when we counseled patients at the clinic . " <p> " I was in a unique position where I had an inpatient clinical pharmacist as the counterpart to my outpatient role , " Drew says . " When that person left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those patients who were in the hospital were missing out on the benefits of having an inpatient pharmacist who could counsel or talk to them about medications they were being prescribed at discharge . Since I work in the same health system as the physicians and patients , I realized I could step into that medication management role . I could speak to patients on the phone or talk to them in the office when they come for their follow-up appointment . I speak to them about any medication changes or questions or concerns they may have , and then I forward that information to the physicians before their appointments . " <p> Together Drew and Pitlick are evaluating results from both of their clinics . " We are analyzing our readmission rates within 30 days and 60 days prior to when we started our collaboration , " Pitlick says . " Then well evaluate readmission rates from a few months into the collaboration . Well also look at how many patients were contacted and how many discrepancies were found . " <p> " Were using readmission rates as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Drew says . <p> Both pharmacists agree they have seen positive results from acting as liaisons between patient and physician . " I was working with a patient who recently started on two types of insulin in the hospital , " Pitlick says . " She was on a very small dose , so one packet of medication lasted more than one month . About a month after being discharged from the hospital the patient came to the clinic with blood sugars in the 300s and 400s , and the week before her sugars were in the upper 100s . The providers were brainstorming on reasons why the sugars changed so quickly , and they asked me to speak with the patient . " Pitlick spoke with the patient , asking her what medications she was currently taking , when she used them , and where she stored them . " She was storing all of her medications on her kitchen table , and since most medications only last for 28 days at room temperature , her insulin lost its ability to work . She came back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the upper 100s . This is not only a great example of how talking with patients and helping them to understand their medications helps but also how pharmacists can work alongside medical providers to help in the problem solving . " <h> The Best Team Member <p> Models for transitions of care are constantly evolving , and new data is being developed each day to offer solutions to avoid patient re-hospitalizations . " The role of pharmacists in these new health care models is as medication managers , " Seaton says . " There are standards for medication management , and pharmacists need to be recognized for providing a consistent and dependable level of care . " There is a growing opportunity for recognition through transition of care improvement models . " The future of health care is team-based care , " Seaton says . " Pharmacists have to be a part of the team because they are the most qualified team members to manage drug therapy .

Martha Bhattacharya , Ph.D. , assistant professor of biology , is researching the degeneration of neurons exposed to drugs like taxol and vincristine . Through a genetic screen performed by Bhattacharya and her collaborators at Washington University School of Medicine ( WUSM ) in St. Louis , Bhattacharya has discovered a gene , TMEM184b , which exhibits neuroprotective and neurodegenerative roles when deleted from an organism . <p> The results from Bhattacharya and her collaborators were published online in the April 27 , 2016 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience . <p> When Bhattacharya began her research in 2008 , she knew the applications for neuron degeneration research were vast . She describes how input from specialists was key in deciding what direction to take with her findings . " During my post-doctoral research at Washington University , I would often talk to a colleague who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed his input on what direction would have the biggest impact on patients . " <h> Tracing the Pathway Backwards <p> To model the process of nerve damage after chemotherapy treatment , Bhattacharya treated fruit flies with taxol and studied the degeneration of axons in their peripheral nervous system after they were treated . Studying the effects of this treatment in fruit flies allowed Bhattacharya to see these processes occurring in the context of the whole organism , as opposed to putting cells in a culture dish . <p> " I had the axons labeled with fluorescent protein so I could look at them as they started to fragment , swell and be lost , " Bhattacharya noted . Focusing on the self-destruction process that occurs in the axon after taxol exposure may lead to the identification of a drug target that could be used in patients to block nerve degeneration . This degeneration can cause chemotherapy patients to feel pain or experience thinking and memory difficulties commonly referred to as chemo brain. <p> Bhattacharyas collaborators in the labs of Aaron DiAntonio , M.D. , Ph.D. , and Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once axon injury was induced , neurons in a dish appeared to experience no change for the first three to five hours , but at hour five or six " everything goes haywire , " Bhattacharya explained .

But , you do n't  see changes occur if you 're looking at the axon as a whole for almost six hours .

He earned an MBA following graduation from STLCOP and served as director of pharmacy at St. Anthonys Medical Center in St. Louis and at the Wentzville facility when it was Crossroads Regional Medical Center , prior to purchase by SSM Healthcare in 2005 . <p> In addition to the type of interprofessional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all behavioral health units at SSM facilities in the St. Louis area . " Because of the cost of many psychiatric drugs , not every hospital can carry them all , " he says . " So we look at which medications have the most evidence-based efficacy and develop an appropriate formulary . Some of the drugs are beginning to go generic , which helps with cost , and we offer a good range of quality medications for our psychiatric patients . " <p> In working with health care professionals , Sansone says he serves as the " drug information headquarters . " To help behavioral health nurses understand the nuances of psychiatric drugs , Sansone developed special learning modules that are included in nurses orientation . The modules provide information on a range of psychiatric drugs from antipsychotics to antidepressants and stimulants used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder . <p> Psychiatrists , too , rely on Sansone for formulary and dosing information . " Psychiatrists have knowledge of psychiatric medicines but are n't  as well versed on other types of medication , " Sansone says . " Since many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychiatrists need to know about potential interactions or other issues , " . <p> Electronic health record systems , like the one used at SSM St. Joseph Health Center-Wentzville , certainly provide a degree of safety in flagging potential drug interactions , but Sansone notes that every newly admitted patient requires a personalized medication review , sometimes involving calls to their community pharmacists to ensure all listed medications are current and correct . " We need to help make sure that the medicines the patient was taking prior to admission are continued and that any new medications are considered in light of the existing regimen , " he says . <p> Yet it is the patient interaction that truly makes psychiatric pharmacy unique . For most people , following a doctors advice for a chronic condition , such as diabetes or high cholesterol , seems like common sense and is adhered to fairly well . Patients listen to their physicians and , for the most part , take their medicine as prescribed . Psychiatric patients , however , realize that the medications being recommended to them are not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cons of taking medications and often need special counseling to understand the reasons for specific prescriptions and the potential side effects in relation to the potential benefits . <p> " Theres a big role for pharmacy but also a human aspect to what I do , " Karadzic says . " Were always taught to consider the pharmacy standpoint in terms of the drugs , how they work and if they 're appropriate , but its through personal interaction that you really start to relate to patients . You see where they 're coming from . You see that the medications with which were treating themand there are a lotis not an easy decision for them in terms of wanting to take it . " <p> Sansone notes that its important to see the individual behind the disease . " No one wants to have a mental illness , " he says . " People just want to feel better , and they 're counting on their doctors , nurses , and pharmacists to help them lead a normal life . " <p> Robert Schmitt 00 has an acute awareness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias . " He manages four psychiatric facilities administered by the Missouri Department of Mental Health as part of a regional pharmacy team . Two are forensic care centers specially designed for inmates or those being assessed for fitness to stand trial , one specializes in pediatric cases , and another is an acute care psychiatric center . <p> Although Schmitt has never been attacked or overtly threatened , he is always aware of the possibility . Patients sometimes act out aggressively against staff members . In these cases , medication is often a lynchpin to calming the patient adequately in order to proceed with counseling and further treatment . <p> " Some of our clients have committed violent crimes , even murder . But we cant focus on that . We have to set our sights on treatment and restoring individuals to the community , " he says . Still , Schmitt exercises caution , knowing that some of his patients may become agitated and aggressive . <p> Extreme mental illness may require creative treatment plans , he adds , noting that medications often need to be adjusted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patient response to various combinations of medications and therapies all come into play when deciding how to proceed . " Understanding patients is really important , " he says . " Pharmacists are crucial here . Psychiatric pharmaceuticals are a unique subclass of medications , and the potential for drug interactions is certainly a concern . " <p> Karadzic finds that some patients feel as if they are giving in to the fact that they have a mental illness when they agree to take a psychiatric drug . Admitting their diagnosis to themselves can be difficult , and complying with medication therapy makes it all real . <p> " In any pharmacy practice , patients choose whether or not to take the medication , so it is a choice-driven process , " he says . " The difficult part of psychiatry is that it can be hard to relate the message of benefits outweighing drawbacks . And that 's why pharmacists play a really crucial rolewere able to break it down to the human level to get the message across . " For instance , he may have to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowsy , but it will also make you feel less depressed , so you can enjoy your grandchildren when they come to visit . " <p> Another technical challenge to treating the psychiatric population involves the slow efficacy of many psychiatric drugs . Unlike medications for high blood pressure or other medical problems , psychiatric drugs can take weeks or months to create noticeable improvements . Again , Karadzic notes that the pharmacist-patient relationship is crucial to explaining this process and ensuring that the patient complies with the medication dosing even if they 're not seeing any immediate results . Patients who exhibit paranoia are especially challenging in this sense , and the challenge is that medications must begin working to control paranoid symptoms in order to help increase compliance . <p> To practice successfully in a psychiatric setting , Karadzic says that listening is a key skill . Many psychiatric patients have been treated for a long time , he notes , and over the years have dealt with a string of physicians , therapists , and other health care professionals . Because of the nature of their illnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn what to say and do in order to convince others of their progress . Realizing this potential , teasing out real concerns , and working together to solve them is the crux of the pharmacist-patient relationship . <p> " We have a big arsenal of medications to draw from , " Karadzic says . " By listening to patients and determining what they are worried about , we can often recommend substitutions that will make them more comfortable with the treatment . " For example , some patients are hesitant to take a pill every day . Instead , Karadzic may recommend a long-acting injection . Expertise in various formulations and strengths of medications is key . <h> Breaking Through <p> " Eventually , the patients begin to ask more realistic questions , and you can see they 're getting on board with their therapy , " Karadzic says . " But the process can be frustrating for everyone . We all want to be rewarded with a positive outcomesooner rather than later . If the patient simply refuses to take a drug , were all stuck until we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees that compliance issues are the most time-consuming discussions he has with patients . " Eighty percent of the patients who are admitted here end up as inpatients because they stopped taking their medications at home , " he says . " Maybe they experienced side effects . Maybe the drugs cost too much . Maybe they felt better and thought they did n't  need to continue taking the medicines . We need to figure out the cause . If patients really want to stop taking a medication , we can work with their physicians to wean them off safely or substitute a different type of drug . " <p> Schmitt finds noncompliance leading to recidivism one of the most frustrating aspects of his practice . " Its a step backward when we see them return , " he says . " Patients who are delusional may think there 's nothing wrong with them , and that 's a real barrier to compliance . " <p> Outpatient education offers a different experience , but one that is equally important . As patients " matriculate " to group homes or other outpatient settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important component . Pharmacists who have developed relationships with long-term inpatients can follow them in the outpatient setting , helping to ensure that they do n't  need additional inpatient treatment . <p> The world of psychiatric pharmacy also combines with the community pharmacy setting , particularly surrounding the many prescriptions for anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication written by primary care physicians . " Community pharmacists have the opportunity to review patients full complement of medications when dispensing prescriptions to help identify any potential problems , " Sansone notes . " They can make the patient aware that some psychiatric medications , like anti-anxiety meds , can cause drowsiness or weight gain . " <h> Transformative practice <p> Karadzic became interested in psychiatric pharmacy during a clinical rotation in a psychiatric inpatient setting . " My interest evolved because it takes some time to really understand what this specialty is all about , " he says . " Its unlike anything else were taught to handle . Its very different in that this patient population is something not many people have exposure to . You have to understand this special subset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being immersed in it . " <p> Since graduating , Karadzic has found support and resources through the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists ( CPNP ) and is pursuing board certification in psychiatric pharmacy . Sansone is board-certified and says the continuing education requirements help him stay on top of the specialty . <p> " There is a good collegial network through the CPNP , " Karadzic says . E-mail communication , articles about new types of psychopharmaceuticals , information on off-label uses , and an annual conference help psychiatric pharmacists stay current and informed . <p> Passing on his knowledge to future pharmacists in psychiatric pharmacy also is important . He precepts students on a regular basis . " We cover this material to some extent in school , but its just not enough to fully appreciate what psychiatric pharmacy is about , " he says . " I would encourage students with an interest to look into the CPNP and seek out rotations at psychiatric sites . " <p> Schmitt , too , welcomes students and believes that psychiatric pharmacy should have a central role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some type of psychiatric medication . He also wants students to know that this specialized aspect of the pharmacy profession may yield some of the greatest rewards . <p> " We see transformation happen all the time , " he says . " A patient who is unstable and combative may come in . Within a year of starting treatment , that person may be completely different . While not everyone that leaves our care is a success story , we make every attempt to contribute to each patients improvement . " <p> Yet the inside view of psychiatric pharmacy can be shocking and initially unsettling for students . Karadzic eases them into it by starting with less complex patients and gradually introducing students to those with more severe mental illness . " I ask them frequently if they 're comfortable and what they think , " he says . " At first , the students seem to want to appear unfazed , but by the middle of our five weeks together they usually admit that some cases freak them out . It comes with the territory , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Karadzic admits to being somewhat numb to the unique nature of his patient base . " I tell people about some of my cases , and then I realize they 're sitting there with their mouths hanging open . I forget how extreme it all sounds . But that 's what makes it fascinating to me.

Doug Joseph 85/ 90 knew something was n't quiteright with his wife , Kris , yet no one could give him any answersuntil one Sunday morning when she could n't get up to walk . <p> Doug Joseph 's memory of Monday , April 28 , 2008 , is amazingly clear . That night , his wife , Kris , asked him to watch her walk . She asked if anything seemed strange about her gait . Doug noticed her right armit was n't swinging like the left one . Later , when he was getting their four young daughters ready for bed , Doug heard a crash from the kitchen . Kris began to scream , " Something is wrong with me ! " She had shattered a ceramic mug on the floor and was crying uncontrollably . Back upstairs , they both could see a muscle twitching on the top of her right hand . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . Doug called an ambulance to their home at 2 a.m. , fearing the possibility of a stroke . The paramedics refused to take her to the hospital because the numbness had subsided by the time they arrived . <p> The next day , she was sent to a neurologist who ordered a nerve conduction study and , what would turn out to be the first of many , MRIs of her brain . Both came back negative . A few days later , Kris couldnt touch her nose with her right index fingercompletely missing the target . Doug drove his wife to the emergency room himself this time , only to be sent home a few hours later . A doctor told her that there were no signs of a stroke and he could find nothing wrong . He said the hospital was full and there were no beds available to evaluate her further . He suggested she follow up with her primary care physician for neurological testing . So they went back home . It never even entered Dougs mind that he and the girls would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The changes in Kris had started two and a half years earlier , but this was the first physical sign they had both noticed . Before that night in April , there had been only subtle changes in her personality and behavior . <p> At first , shortly after their fourth daughter was born , Doug 85/90 began to pick up on some strange behaviors . Kris started having severe anxiety attacks , which , at times , made her intensely irritableso different than the spirited , funny , and compassionate person that Doug and others had always been easily drawn to . She had been a critical care nurse for organ transplant and cardio-thoracic surgery patients for 15 years before starting a family . Even after her days as a nurse were well behind her , she kept a well-stocked first-aid kit in the familys van , in case she came across an accident and needed to pull over to help . She had always wanted to stay home with their children , and was thrilled when it actually happened after the birth of their first child . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't happy in Illinois . <p> During their nine-year marriage , Doug and Kris traveled to the Caribbean and Mexico , willing the days to last just a little longer in the warm humidity of the islands . They dreamed of packing it in and leaving the cold winters in Joliet , Ill. , for a warmer climate . Before they were married , Kris had even lived in Hawaii for a while , and the couple often talked about moving there . So in August 2005 , Doug , a senior manager in the pharma- coepidemiology department at Takeda Global Research and Development at the time , put their house up for sale in Illinois and flew to Honolulu to interview for a management position there . The company wanted him to move to the island as soon as possible , so he suggested the family ( which now included all four girls ) stay in Illinois until the house sold and he got settled in . Suddenly , Kris was dead set against the idea and said , " If we cant go with you , then nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet Kris kept telling all of their family , friends , and neighbors that that they were moving to Hawaii . She even started giving away some of their belongingspatio furniture , a stereo system , clothes , and other valuable things they had around the house . Doug thought it was oddand a little embarrassingbut he did n't  know what to make of it at the time . <p> Six months later , the family of six moved to Tucson . Doug was n't sure if they should go through with the move because , by then , arguments between he and Kris were becoming common and their relationship was strained . And Kris was starting to struggle with depression . But she was convinced that moving to Tucson , where she and Doug had gotten engaged , was the place for them to be . Doug stuck with their decision , thinking the change might do Kris some good . At least , he hoped so . He wanted to help bring back the person he married and was so desperately seeking again . Yet , gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned several times by Kris who , as a devout Catholic , had been fervently opposed to divorce up until then . Kris was becoming full of anger , turning into someone he no longer knew . Their marriage was becoming more and more fragile . Kris blamed Doug for her unhappiness and , soon , he started to blame himself , too . " I thought , maybe its me , " says Doug , " because she turned from such a loving , gentle , and kind person to somebody who hated my guts . " They even saw a therapist for a while . Turns out , the problem was n't marital . Doug would eventually discover the shocking diagnosis : Kris had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . <p> Sometimes misunderstood and very often misdiagnosed , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) is most commonly known as " mad cow disease . " But there are three different kinds of the disease : sporadic , acquired , and familial , which is the type Kris had . It is an elusive and always fatal brain disorder that causes memory loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Parkinsons disease-like involuntary movements , inflexibility of limbs , and gait disturbances . Its victims eventually succumb to blindness , coma , and death , when the disease is often finally diagnosed by autopsy . CJD is extremely rare . Only one case per million is reported each year . Kris was that one in a million . <p> By the time the first physical symptoms appeared , Doug knew something was seriously wrong . And at that point , Kris knew it too . She had said , several times , that she thought she was going to die soon . One night , while lying in bed together , she asked Doug if he was happy that she was going to die . Doug said , " Of course not , and you 're not going to die ! Why would you think I 'd be happy ? " She seemed oblivious to his question , instead saying " If I do die , I want my friend in Illinois to raise the girls . " While Doug was still trying to make sense of what his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologizing for all the hurtful things she had ever said , asking him to forgive her . Her thought processes were already becoming jumbled . <p> " When she made that comment about the kids , " says Doug , " I knew there was something wrong . I had known for a little bit prior to that , but now , I knew she was really sick . " Something was tearing them apart . And neither she nor Doug had any idea what they were going to have to go through to find out what it was . <p> In 2007 , a few months after moving into their new home in Oro Valley , Ariz. , Kris gave in to nagging tingling and numbness in her right hand , which she then attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome , and scheduled surgery . Everything went smoothly . But soon her unusual personality changes escalated dramatically , sometimes into explosive , violent outbursts . Doug remembers one morning before work when Kris shoved him into a corner and started hitting him with her fists . She threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  remember why she was mad at him . Another time , in a fit of rage , Kris wrapped a belt around his neck , attempting to choke him . She accused Doug of having an affair , which was only fodder for the divorce argument . " It is a disease that causes paranoia and psychosis , " Doug says . " I never had an affair with anybody . " And all the while , Kris was feeding false information to her parents , telling them that Doug was the reason for her increasingly bizarre behavior . They thought Kris was suffering from anxiety or stress and that Doug was the real problem . In fact , Kriss family accused him of poisoning her during her last days in the hospital . " It was hard for people to really comprehend what was going on . That 's what happens when you do n't  have any answers . People start grabbing at straws to try to make sense of the situation . " <p> After visiting nearly every neurologist and emergency room in Tucson and coming up empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and minute of her life . By June 2008 , things had gotten so bad , so quickly , that her speech began to slur and she felt numb on the right side of her face . She had terrible muscle spasms that would force her arm behind her head . And she was having trouble walking . But no one could figure out why . She was admitted to hospitals for full workups of MRIs , CAT scans , and EEGsall showed nothing . Doug and Kris did n't  know what was going on eitherand they were health care professionals . Because the symptoms do n't  manifest until the end stages of CJD , Kris was continually given a diagnosis of " psychiatric illness " or " conversion disorder . " No one seemed to be able to explain her disturbing behavior or had a clue as to what was really happening inside her central nervous system . Yet there was one key piece of information that modern medicine kept overlooking . Kriss 83-year-old uncle had recently died of CJD , and familial CJD is passed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University of Arizona Medical Center , Kris flat out asked one of the neurologists if she might have CJD since her uncle died of the disease just nine months earlier . He confidentlyand somewhat arrogantlyreplied , " No , that 's not what you have . " They were being written off by the medical establishment , and their frustration was mounting . <p> Kris spiraled downward so rapidly that she could n't bathe , dress , or wipe herself after a bowel movement . Doug did all of that for her . He was working full time as a clinical pharmacist at Tucson Heart and Cardiovascular Institute , tending to Kriss needs , and taking care of his little girls , ages 3 , 5 , 7 , and 8 . On Sunday , June 29 , Kris could no longer get up to walk . She could barely talk . Doug took her to the only hospital left in Tucson they had n't  yet tried because he just could n't care for her by himself anymore . The next day , he was told once again that Kris was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his foot down and demanded one more evaluation by another neurologist . Finally , on July 1 , the last of Kriss MRIs came back positive for some kind of brain abnormality . She had had three negative MRIs in the past month . Now Doug was finally learning that there was something neurologically wrong with his wife . Three weeks before Kris died , a neurologist told Doug , " Some neurological diseases can progress very fast and not show up until later in the final disease process . Its definitely not psychiatric . It could be brain cancer or it could be Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . " <p> Doug knew exactly what that meant . There 's no cure for CJD . It meant his four little girls were going to have to spend the rest of their lives without their mom . He was helpless . He and Kris both knew she did n't  have much time left , and they cried about it together in her hospital room . Doug spent their few remaining weeks together at Kriss bedside , trying to make her as comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kriss brain tissue came back positive for CJD . By July 18 , she was in a coma . The last time the girls had seen their mom , she was able to move and still talk a little . Now she was unable to move or speak , though she still knew what was going on around her . Talia , the youngest at 3 , climbed up on the bed to snuggle with her mom for the last time . A tear rolled down Kriss cheek . She passed away a few days later , on July 25 , 2008 , at 9:21 a.m . She was 43 . <p> After Kris died , Doug started writing a letter to his daughters . He wanted them to know what their mom was really like before her illness . He kept writing and writing until he realized that he could use the information to educate other people , especially medical professionals , about CJD . The result is his book , Kriss Story : Battling Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , published in 2010 . In July , he will attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. , for researchers around the world who are presenting the latest information on the disease . He now works to educate others . He works to find a cure for his daughters . <p> Because Kriss disease was genetic , there 's a 50 percent chance that each of his daughters may carry the same genetic mutation that caused the disease in their mom . And a carrier has a 90 percent chance of developing the disease at some point in their lifetime . Though they may not yet fully understand the ramifications , Doug simply tells the girls the truth . " They know their mom died of a disease that was genetically transmitted and there 's a possibility they can die from it , too . But its not something we worry about or think about a lot . We just take one day at a time . "

The sequencesCYP450 , 2C19 , 3A5 , 2D6may seem vaguely familiar . ( Or maybe not ) . <p> They correspond to different enzymes in the liver and determine how patients metabolize and process medication . His small office at Family Care Pharmacy in Highland , Illinois , can not contain his enthusiasm for the emerging practice of pharmacogenomics and what he believes is the next major evolution for patient care . He is one of a small number of pharmacists in the U.S. who is developing and being compensated for his work in the specialty area of practice . <p> Now appearing on his screen are the results of a genetic test from a patient being treated at a pain clinic several states away . The results of the test will determine , among other things , if her pain can be controlled by opiates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if their patients will have pain control with narcotics , " Fieker explains . " Its here in black and white , so physicians now know if they need to adjust their dosage . " <p> Fieker is a consultant for a genetic testing laboratory . Pharmacists and physicians are increasingly using genetic testing for patients who are taking a host of medications , such as warfarin or antidepressants , to help use the correct dosage . A physician orders the genetic test and includes the patients medication information . After the lab does its work , Fieker analyzes the results and submits his recommendations for medication therapy . <p> " We make the results actionable , and something they can use and apply rather than stick it away in the patients electronic medical record and never look at again , " Fieker says . " Its a win for the patient , physician , and lab . We talk about medication therapy management all the time , and this to me , is a natural extension of that . " <p> The lab tests target enzymes in the liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain medication , blood thinners , antidepressants , and HIV antivirals , are metabolized . The enzymes determine how quickly the body breaks down the chemical ingredients in the medication . For instance , a patient might be a poor metabolizer of clopidogrel , a medication used to inhibit blood clots . Since the medication is a prodrug , the body metabolizes it into its active form . The patient is at risk of having less of the active ingredient in his system and not getting the full benefit of the drug . The opposite might be true if a patient is an ultra-rapid metabolizer , which could lead to a buildup of the active ingredient and , consequently , excessive bleeding . <p> " Then you 're putting yourself in a position where you 're exacerbating the side effects of medications , " Fieker says . <p> Fieker started exploring ways to integrate pharmacogenomics into his community pharmacy practice less than two years ago at a meeting of the National Community Pharmacists Association ( NCPA ) . Never one to miss out on an opportunity , Fieker decided to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to representatives of genetic testing labs and pharmacists who were involved in pharmacogenomics at a clinic in Alabama .

Fieker left with a textbook and began reading . His interest in genetics was shared by a student who happened to be on rotation at Family Care Pharmacy . <p> " We fed off each other , thinking about the first steps we had to take in establishing a community-based program , " Fieker says . <p> From the beginning , Fieker did all of the legwork on the concept . Working without a roadmap , he attended a symposium , continued to network with others in the field , and read everything available on the subject , both in textbooks and online . And there were no shortcuts along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the decision that I was going to figure out how to do this , " Fieker says . " It was consciously deciding to put the work into bringing the program to my community , so my patients and the physicians whom I collaborate with can benefit from this discipline . " <p> And experts say the door is wide open for pharmacists with an entrepreneurial spirit who are willing to get in on the ground floor of a new area of study . <p> " I do n't  know if we know the potential yet , " says Kurt A. Proctor , Ph.D. , RPh , senior vice president of strategic initiatives at NCPA . " Dan is on the leading edge of something that is clearly going to grow . I am extremely interested and had my own genes tested . I believe in it wholeheartedly . " <p> One of the many things Fieker loves about being an independent pharmacist is the ability to learn and try new things to expand his business . He still feels like a student of pharmacy even though he graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> " Pharmacists have an obligation to patients to take care of them as best we can , " Fieker says . " So we have an obligation to make sure that were giving them all the information they deserve . " <p> For now , Fieker is building his practical expertise . But he would like to eventually change the model and advocate for pharmacists to order genetic testing . Pharmacists in the community have already built rapport with physicians and can demonstrate how testing can benefit their practice . <p> " The physicians I work with in Highland all trust us , " Fieker notes . " Physicians come to me all the time with questions . " <p> Proctor is hopeful that other pharmacists will follow in the not-too-distant future . <p> " I think pharmacists can step up in this area , and its an opportunity for them to demonstrate their value and role , " Proctor says .
