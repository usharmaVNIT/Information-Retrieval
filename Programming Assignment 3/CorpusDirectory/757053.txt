Good call on the 1975 logo being from an alternate universe , it is probably the biggest departure in the NBC timeline yet even though not as effective as the peacock , remains quite timeless . <p> Actually the 1975 was an offshoot if not the original of a logo designed by Lippincott and Margulies design firm around 1970 . Unfortunately , the Nebraska Educational Television Network came knocking on NBCs door . Seems it was an exact copy of the Nebraska networks logo . Ultimately NBC had to buy the rights to the logo .

I wanted this one to look like it was drawn by someone in an MC , then photocopied over the years . Degraded . Last thing I wanted was something " slick " for this one , yknow ? A few people said it looked like Skeletor , which is fine . Was going for a laughing Reaper . Very inspired by the SOA patch . <p> Ill be arranging a sticker and t-shirt pressing this week . Watch for this one in the Signalnoise Store soon . <p> Here are a couple more things I worked on recently for Kevin Smith , which you might have seen at the merch table if you saw Kevin live during his UK/Ireland tour . Here we have the UK/Ireland tour poster as well as a t-shirt designed for Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kevin and his team are always a pleasure to work with . Real nice people , enthusiastic about their shows and always positive feedback when I send them designs . Absolute dream client . I never get the impression I 'm working for them , rather working along side them . That goes a long way , man . <p> I even had the pleasure of meeting Kevin and Scott Mosier when they were in Halifax a couple of weeks ago . Super nice guys , really love what they do . They invited me to hang out and watch the show from backstage . Amazing time . <p> If you get the chance to see Kevin and his friends speak live in your city , I highly recommend it . <p> Here we go . On the list of " cool stuff I hope to do during my career as a designer " , this project lands right at the top , filed under " 1 . Design a shirt for my favorite metal band " . Enter the heavy as hell , talented Texans known as The Sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to their Myspace and immediately thought " The Sword , that 's a cool name for a band " and decided to give them a listen . I fired up Iron Swan for the first time , which is a funny introduction to the bands sound- considering- the fairly long subdued intro . I was sitting at my desk with headphones on , then the song tore into the heavy and almost took my head clean off . Fan for life , right there . No foolin . Been listening to the boys- consistently- ever since , throughout their albums- Age of Winters , Gods of the Earth and their most recent space epic Warp Riders . <p> " Man , I 'd love to work with those guys someday . " said James , years ago . <p> Last February I sit down at my computer and a tweet from the band pops up " Hey , were looking for an artist " , or something like that . 20 seconds later I had my website link over to them . 2 minutes later I shot over an email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my favorite metal troop , developed a poster that was used on 2 of their tours ( Australia and Europe ) , and now a brand new t-shirt the boys will be having- on-hand- as they tour with Kyuss Lives this fall . So damn proud . <p> Shown above is what I created for the guys . Total artistic freedom , they let me run hog wild on this thing and offered some helpful tips along the way . You can definitely hear a vast metal influence in their sound so I wanted this design to be thrown back to the roots of metal way back , talkin Black Sabbath days with a twist of The Sword in there . I used their older logo because it just reeks of old school metal . Love that thing . Shown here are 4 different colorways . <p> Throw this one into the " good people doing good work " file . At the beginning of all my broadcasts you will hear me say something like " Coming at you live from Dartmouth , Nova Scotia . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumble little crew holding down the shores of Dartmouth . A proud crew , who may or may not carry switchblades . <p> Well , allow me to introduce you to the small but mighty Dartmouth Clothing Co . Owned , operated , built , muscled and chiseled by my mohawked pal Eric Miller . He works his ass off on his designs , screen-prints all of these shirts in his basement by hand , then packs and ships everything on his own . This is homegrown , people . This is where its at . Brute force Eric . Not to be messed with . <p> There are 2 reasons why Eric and his Dartmouth Clothing Co. are landing on the blog . First off , Signalnoise supports this guy and what he s doing . All on his own , just getting it done in 1-color awesomeness . Secondly , Eric and I had a meeting a little while back about a team-up , which I 'm really excited about . Dartmouth Clothing Co. vs . Signalnoise . Designs are flowing and I 'm excited to see these things on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is another design originally intended for a Nike Air t-shirt . This was created around the same time as the previous Los Angeles 1984 design , presumably for the same campaign . Once again , I was tasked with taking a previous illustration Nike had in their archive , and redesigning with a modern flare . This was a fun one , and I had a good time working with the gradients . <p> Once the job was complete I once again took it upon myself to finish the design with some textures and lighting . I enjoy doing the straight textures but the design really comes to life when those additional details are added . <p> The specific poster design you see here was n't used , just something I did after the fact . I 'm not sure where the molecule design itself landed in the campaign , if you see it let me know . <p> Hey Halifax ! I 'm happy to announce that you now have easier access to the Signalnoise line of designer t-shirts . All of the designs are now available to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you live here in town , there is no need to order online and pay unnecessary shipping . Just drop into Strange Adventures to check out my wares . Made local by a local . <p> There is a display set up on the counter , tucked between the toys and comic books , exactly where I pictured my apparel to be in the first place . Big thanks to my buddy ( and owner of the shop ) Cal for setting all this up . 
@@121792029 @10792029/ <h> Pepsi Cool Cans <p> Back in the summer of 1990 Pepsi released some limited edition " Cool Cans . " I was 14 years old , and I clearly- remember going nuts for these things . I was firmly entrenched in the Pepsi camp of the- Cola Wars- and we had plenty of bottles in my parents fridge , but I also- needed these cans . The nearest vending machine was just passed the woods in my backyard at the local community swimming pool . I used to borrow some change from my dads coin bucket and sprint through the trails leading to that Pepsi machine . There were days I made many trips to that pool just for a cold can of soda . <p> There were only four different can designs , however it took me the entire summer to collect them all . I was sure Pepsi had staggered their release just to prolong my agony . I ended up with tons of the surfer dude design , which ensured that it became my least favorite of the bunch . That guy used to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I 'm telling you . <p> The design I most coveted was the neon one , it was the most unique of the group and was downright badass . Some- internet psychologists- may claim that I was somehow subliminally drawn to the neon design because it contained a- hidden message . When stacked 3-high and positioned just right , the larger letterforms on the can kinda-sorta spell out the word " SEX . " So even though I never saw the cans stacked that way , and getting them from a vending machine assured that I did n't  know which one I was getting , I still must have been brainwashed by Pepsi into unconsciously choosing it for its " sexiness . " Hogwash . <p> These designs , paired with Pepsis most iconic logo , are my first memories of a true marketing campaign . Stepping up from toy packaging and advertising , I began to recognize there was a larger world of design and branding out there for me to explore . <p> I have 3 / 4 of the 1990 cool cans in my collection ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confetti looking one ) . I 'm excited for cokes new designs for this summer but I have n't seen any out in the wild just yet . Hopefully soon . 
@@121792031 @10792031/ <p> When I was growing up G.I. Joe and Transformers were a lethal one-two punch for my imagination . The toys were cool , the cartoons were awesome , but the box art was the catalyst for daydreaming . Seeing that stuff on the shelves , looking at the hand-crafted portraits of the characters really got my mind going . The fact that these were actually painted , with all the textures and imperfections that come along with that process , really drove home a certain personality that is all but lost on kids today . <p> Super proud to be participating in the HAS BROS art show in November at The Dart Gallery in my hometown of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia . My buddies Dave Howlett and Eric Miller have been spearheading this thing for the past while , and I 'm pumped to unleash the news . Art based on toys from the 80s ? ! How can I NOT be all over that ? <p> here 's the official show info <p> HAS BROS is a new art show featuring work inspired by 1980s toy franchises like MASTERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUTANT NINJA TURTLES , and more ! Running at- The Dart Gallery- from November 9-20 , HAS BROS will feature new pieces by some of the top artistic talent from the Maritimes and beyond . Contributors will include comic artists like Nick Bradshaw ( WOLVERINE &amp; THE X-MEN ) , Jordyn Bochon ( CUIRRO ) , Andrew Power ( APTITUDE TEST ) , Dave Howlett ( SLAM-A-RAMA ) , graphic designers like Eric Miller of Dartmouth Clothing Company , James White of Signalnoise Studios , Paul Panfalone ( AKA Paul Pants ) , Joshua M. Smith ( AKA Hydro74 ) , and many more ! Prints of all the pieces will be on sale at the gallery as well . No batteries required , no assembly needed , no parental supervision necessary ! <p> As for me , I 'll be submitting a new little series of StarKade prints to the show . 4 brand new fun character illustrations ( edition of 25 each ) and a rare mystery one . Ill have sets on sale at the show on November 9 , then any remaining stock will be available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fun ! <p> Ill be announcing the new StarKade prints the week of the show . Do n't  change that channel <p> Some killer posters coming out of Acid Free Gallery in a team-up with Hasbro . Here we have Tom Whalen on Transformers and Dave Perillo on GI Joe . I 'm a big fan of people putting a cool modern spin on my childhood favorites while keeping the energy and flavour of the franchise intact . Tom and Dave have done just that . Love these . <p> Fire ! Wood ! Water ! Hasbro licensed these wicked dudes from Takara Japan to sell in the States and elsewhere in 1987 . They were a Transformers spin-off in Japan , but Hasbro decided not to tie into that continuity with their own marketing . The mid 80s was a time when many toys had some sort of gimmick to help sell them , in this case , each Battle Beast had a heat sensitive sticker on its chest that revealed either fire , wood , or water . A sort of paper , rock , scissors in toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water beat fireif you were a super lucky kid , there existed rare and mythical Sunburst figures ; find one , and you could beat anyone . Bad ass . <p> Battle Beasts came packaged in pairs , which was strange at the time . I remember thinking how cool it was to get " two for the price of one " , although its a pretty commonplace tactic these days . I always considered the pairings to be like pro wrestling tag teams . My first pack consisted of the Rhino and the Fox ; whenever there was a Beast Battle Royal in my back yard , those two always found a way to come out victorious . Still my favorites to this day . <p> My brother and I collected every one of these pint-sized animal warriors along with their many play sets ; looking back , we had some really fun times with them . Unfortunately , somewhere along the road to adulthood my collection must have landed in the trash . The same old sad story . When I took a quick peek on eBay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much they are going for . Like adding salt to the wound . While it does n't  seem as if I 'll be scooping up any replacements anytime soon , at least Ive got the memories . <p> Remember Robo Force ? Did n't  think so . Even if you grew up in the 80s there 's a pretty good chance you missed out on these radical robots . Ideal Toys debuted them at the 1984 Toy Fair ; unwittingly pitting them head-to-head with the Gobots and the Transformers , both of which apparently caught the company by surprise . Without the power to transform and very limited poseability , Robo Force simply could n't compete with rival toy lines . Ideal pulled the plug on Robo Force in 1985 , a planned- second series- was prototyped , but never saw the store shelves . <p> Ideal put a huge amount of marketing muscle behind Robo Force for its initial launch , with a- one-shot cartoon special , commercials , story books , - board games , lunchboxes , a magazineand that 's just the short list . There was even a- Maxx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They really went all out , unfortunately it just was n't enough to overcome the toys inherent shortcomings . <p> My brother and I had a few of these , he started out with the mighty leader Maxx Steele while I went for his evil counterpart , Hun-dred . My fondest memories of these toys was in the early summer of 1984 when we left Western New York to live in sunny Florida . My parents packed us up in the Chevy Monte Carlo and we were off on a three day journey to parts unknown . Keeping my brother and I company in the back seat were our Robo Force guys , mini command centers my dad carved out of solid styrofoam , and a cooler full of Dr Pepper . To this day , with the potent combination of indestructible robots ( these things were built like tanks ) , squeaky breaking styrofoam , and a seemingly endless supply of caffeine , I have no idea how my parents retained their sanity . By the time we had settled in Orlando , Transformers had taken over our robot play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dustbin . Sorry guys . <p> My Robo Force figures are long gone and trying to find quality images of them on the web can prove to be insanely difficult . Thankfully , there are a couple of sites- that helped me put this post together : BattleGrip- &amp;- Roboplastic . Give them a look , they are both bursting at the seams with awesome stuff . <p> I left off with the Odyssey story as I was re-designing The Planet characters in an attempt to adapt them to a line of designer toys ( see Part V : A New Start ) which had me doing a lot of research into the hip and cool toy scene . As I stated before , I 've wanted to design my own toys since I was 7 years old and had that dream re-kindled with the rise of Kid Robot and other designer toymakers- a number of years ago . <p> After completing the updated- wireframes I posted in the last installment I had a better idea of how The Planet figures might work in 3-dimensional form . So to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how an unpainted toy might look . My primary weapon for the Planet has always been vector , so I proceeded to add simple gradients to the wireframe to show highlight and shadow . <p> I was fairly happy with the pose and stature of the character at this point , so it was time to add some color based on my original concepts developed a couple of years prior <p> The character was starting to come to life again , and now came the step I was most looking forward to . Naturally , I was thinking about the backstory while developing the new concept but it needed to be revised to add a bit more life to the idea . Having 3 characters- with basically the same paint job worked for the original project idea , but was n't all that interesting when you start thinking toys . I needed more color and personality from the design to really make it work . <p> Here are some of my initial color experiments : <p> While designing at this stage I went to my local comic shop and picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement over the years . The book was a tremendous help in getting my creative juices going but one thing jumped out at me , bears . There was a huge number of cute toys in the book donning the same little bear ears my characters had , so I worked on changing the head design a little bit . . . something more dynamic . <p> Nostalgia naturally took over , and I started thinking about the toys I loved when I was a kid . Transformers , GI-Joe , He-man , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Voltron and a bunch of others in an attempt to figure out why those toylines caught my attention 25 years ago . They were all basic designs ( with the exception of Transformers ) with bright colors and distinctive- symbols that differentiated- the characters from one another . The Ninja Turtles had nothing more then different colored masks , pretty ingenious . <p> After a lot of sketching , color experimenting and writing , the toyline really started to take shape after I added a bit of logo design and color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character model is the same across the board , the characters were separated from one another using simple colors and symbols yet worked as a team , just like those toys from my childhood . They now had personality , style , powers and most importantly . . . names ! <p> It struck me soon afterward that the original title for this project The Planet , which I continued to call it was n't going to work anymore . It had grown outside of the original scope , was a little too vague , and I needed something that would reflect the team that Hydro , Ember , Chloro and Amour were part of . It needed to be dynamic , original , cosmic and most important of all it needed to be exciting . <p> I enlisted the help of Sameen , the wizard of words that she is to help me name this team of colorful little heroes , and she did n't  disappoint . <p> Next up , the final chapter : Part VII : Long Live the Orbinauts ! <p> Need to catch up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check out : 
@@121792033 @10792033/ <p> Beautiful illustration and design work by Netherlands-based artist Stefan Glerum . Stefans obvious and honest appreciation of illustration from the past took me by complete surprise this morning . Not only is his pencil work beautiful and appropriately aged , he had an excellent eye for aesthetic , color and typography . <p> His hand-lettered elements and odd characters harken back to 1920s Europe , maybe with a touch of Bauhaus and Parisian Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec ? At any rate , Im thrilled to see someone take such an off-kilter illustration style and apply it to modern projects and events . <p> This work is so accurately executed , I cant believe its current . Check out more work by Stefan Glerum on his official website . <p> My good pal Luke Beard over in England started an interesting initiative at the beginning of 2010 .

Nice clean lines and somber images of cosmonauts floating in space and urban scenes . I particularly like the topmost image , really like to have that one hanging in the living room . <p> Jeremy has a wonderful way of melding the past with the present . His cosmonauts have a certain 2001 : A Space Odyssey flavor brought to modern street scenes , a strange but wonderful displacement <p> Michael Bierut is a partner at the mighty Pentagram Design in New York .

Knopf , the Walt Disney Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry Association , Princeton University , Yale School of Architecture , New York University . . . the list goes on and on . <p> Posted above is a presentation Michael gave at the Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn last month , a very honest , direct and humorous talk on the topic of clients . Good clients , bad clients , the traits of both , keeping good ones , getting rid of bad ones , etc . I found Michaels points of view on the topic of clients extremely sobering , to the point of my feeling the need to change how I conduct Signalnoise in order to find those connections with clients needed to , not get rich , but to do good work with good people . <p> This is a video all designers should watch whether you are a seasoned veteran or a student .

Shown above is the final album cover design I created for the guys . <p> I mentioned this in a previous post about the band , but there is nothing better then working with someone who is excited about their project . That makes me excited , and inevitably makes the work better . Reckless Loves sound is inspired by hard rock and hair metal bands from the 80s , polished and updated nicely . So naturally , the design hearkens back to that era being inspired by bands such as M+tley Cr++e and Van Halen : <p> Ive been listening to the final album for a little while now as I worked on the designs and I really ca n't wait for the release . Its construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun from the era that inspires them , without any irony . Its no secret that I love modern updates of things past , so I 've enjoyed every second of working on this project . <p> I 've seen these vintage Porsche advertisements floating around Ffffound and various design blogs for the past little while , but after coming across this post on A Time to Get I felt compelled to share them as well . <p> I 'm seeing a trend in design recently utilizing vintage photography , either greyscale or muted tones with big bold typography and flat color blocks , perhaps inspired by ads such as these . I particularly enjoy the off-kilter diagonals used for the bold color treatments and typography baselines . Beautiful stuff . <p> I cant say enough good things about the work of Mads Berg . With a vintage travel poster and art deco flavor mixed with some Picasso and Bauhaus on the side , Mads creates a wonderful posters and illustrations with simple shapes and elegant typography .

If I were to direct a film based on my favorite action shows from the 1980s , I 'd hire Lee to add this cool sexiness to every shot . <p> Excellent use of cropping and color , and Lee seems to dance on the line between slick and gritty . Great stuff .

The response has been incredible . <p> I kept the competition description simplistic for a very good reason .

I wanted those interested in entering to work the exact same way I do , and to create some new pieces they can be proud of . As a result , just look at the diversity of the posters below . Their styles , content and palettes are all over the map which in my opinion , makes this competition a huge success .

I 'm not talking about making buttloads of money or landing some big agency gigs , but moreso personal development and building a more solid brand foundation . Its normal for me to feel like I 'm floundering around trying to find direction , but looking back at this year I can see a more focused vision despite starting off on the wrong foot . <p> So here we go a look at 2013 and some of the highlights the year brought . <p> February 2013 : - Vintage console illustrations After a year of trying to design movie posters , I decided to give up on the dream out of sheer frustration .

Had loads of fun doing these . <p> April 2013 : - Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon The best client project I ever worked on .

One of the guests was none other than Kurt Russell . I got to hang out with , talk some movies and things with him and give him my poster of THE THING . Heck of a nice guy too .

This was a big deal since I had basically given up on doing movie posters after a year-long attempt to break into the poster community proved unsuccessful in 2012 . I had a wonderful time building this poster for my pals at Skuzzles . <p> July 2013 : - Mission patch logos for NFB Space School Its no secret that I enjoy all things to do with space exploration , so I was thrilled when I got a call from the National Film Board of Canada to design mission patch style logos for their launch of the NFB Space School .

" . To my surprise they were onboard , and I developed them this hilarious design . Badass . I even put all the Photoshop version release dates on the back of the shirt just like tour dates . So much fun . <p> August 2013:The StarKade Series - While building the deck on the back of my house during the summer I decided I wanted to design some fun little illustrations depicting WWE wrestlers from my youth .

That bearded man-mountain is Carolina Panther Ryan Kalil , and that baseball-capped fella is designer extraordinaire Matt Stevens . I was in town speaking at Blend Conference and Ryan was nice enough to sit down with Matt and I to jaw about some football , design , film and other fun projects . We had a killer time , so much so that Ryan turned me into a Panthers fan for life . Got ta support your buddies ! <p> November 2013 : - Creative Spark , Lynda documentary I 'm still stunned that this happened .

We got to the bottom of a lot of issues , and they designed the iPad version of the issue complete with an animated panther illustration I created for them . Whoa . Being interviewed by the very people who create the software I use every day blew my mind . Thank-you Adobe ! <p> All year : - Signalnoise 2013 World Tour- One of the biggest highlights for Signalnoise this year was the amount of traveling I did . There were 20 live dates booked across Canada , the United States , Europe and even the Philippines . Think I spent more time in hotel rooms than I did at home . Once again , a giant thanks to everyone who invited me to their events , everyone who came out to see me speak , and a shout to all those fellow presenters I had the pleasure of meeting in 2013 . <p> Rarely do I use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light recently and I 'm having a hard time keeping quiet about it . <p> Earlier today , Abduzeedo posted this article about an incident that happened last week . A polite outline ( as expected from Abduzeedo ) can be found explaining- what happened and how they dealt with it , but let me highlight the section that rubbed me the wrong way <p> " We featured a beautiful photo in a post , giving full credit and linking back to the photographer and his work . We loved his work , it was on 500px and featured all options of sharing including on Pinterest , Facebook , Twitter and even an Embed Code . Maybe too used to the idea of sharing and fair usage , we included his image . <p> Unfortunately , we received a series of requests , like removing the content , which we did right away , a demand for public apology , which we more than happily did on the same blog post and a penalty fee . We apologize for featuring his work on our blog . Our one and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are truly sorry . " <p> Right , so Abduzeedo shared a photo- in an inspiration round-up ( with credit and link ) and he wanted it removed . Fair enough , we all have final say when its our artwork in question and he has every right to request removal . He wanted a public apology . Kinda weird given there was no damage done , but alright . And of course , Abduzeedo obliged . <p> Then I read the part about the penalty fee that 's when I got uneasy . As far as I can tell , a " penalty fee " means a demand for monetary compensation . A fee for sharing a photo with full credit ? Abduzeedo never claimed ownership of the photo , nor did they re-sell the image . Confused , I clicked on the link to where the photo is housed , and arrived here on 500px . Let me draw your attention to the giant social share buttons in the upper right corner of that page , which includes an option to embed the photo in your site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's have a look at what 500px has on their About page I circled a pretty key word . <p> As I said earlier , we all have final say when it comes to our artwork , but this raises some important questions if one does not want their photos shared , then why would one put them on a site BUILT for sharing then attack someone who shares them ? Are these penalty fees demanded from everyone who shares a photo on Pinterest ? Facebook ? Twitter ? Ffffound ? Tumblr ? Where exactly do we draw the line on what sharing is acceptable and what is n't ? <p> Rarely do I use the Signalnoise platform in this manner , but I cant sit idle and watch this kind of thing happen especially to a site which has done nothing but foster creativity and inspiration for the design community for 7 years . Designers depend on sharing in order to spread work across the web , whether its for promotion or inspiration and I 'm worried this is setting a horrible precedent . <p> Am I coming to the defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue here , the core idea of sharing . <p> I urge you to discuss your feelings and views , because man , I really think this needs to be discussed . The louder the better . <p> To say its been a busy year would be a complete understatement . 2013 had , by a wide margin , the most travel Ive ever done in my life . The Signalnoise World Tour kicked off in February with a 26-hour journey to Manila and I have n't been sitting still since . The year went by so fast that I 'm stunned to be writing this post already . <p> This year brought with it FAR too many wonderful meetings , memories , laughs and awesome times that I can not possibly list them all in this meagre blog post . I 'm not even going to try , man . <p> But this post DOES serve a very important purpose a GIANT THANK-YOU to everyone responsible for all the killer events I attended and spoke at this year . I 'm absolutely honoured that youd even consider me to take your stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell stories . You are held in the highest regard . <p> And finally , another mega thanks to everyone who attended the events , and hung around long enough to see me speak . Every audience was so energetic and inspiring it made telling my little story a complete pleasure . So many of you hung out after events for drinks and laughs , the best thing a guy far from home can ask for . <p> Thus concludes the Signalnoise World Tour 2013 . Hope to see you in 2014 as I start announcing new speaking dates soon . 
@@121792039 @10792039/ <p> I was really looking forward to Signalnoise Broadcast 12 all week . This time around the broadcast was topic-based where we discussed personal projects , the things that we work on outside of client projects . It was a lot of fun to discuss the work that keeps us motivated on our own time , those little dream projects that we all inevitably hope to do full time some day . <p> On top of that , I gave the audience a sneak preview of my own new personal project . The gang got the first glimpse at my upcoming Signalnoise t-shirt line and I showed the first of 4 designs that will come with the launch , as well as some of the packaging and freebies I 've been working on for the past month or so . <p> I was really excited to finally show some new material , and there will be much more to come very soon ! Now with that , I am off to Toronto to see one of my favorite bands live , Iron Maiden ! Have a great weekend , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my progression as an artist and talk about a guy who had a huge influence on me and my work at an important time . Dave McKean was introduced to me way back in 1993 or something by way of his Sandman comic book covers . <p> I was instantly made crazy by his work , mostly because I did n't  really know what I was looking at . His work introduced me to the idea of " mixed media " , he was so multi-faceted as an artist that he used an array of mediums to create his pieces and designs . Paint , ink , sculpture , typography , photography , construction , he really did it all and used certain disciplines to achieve certain goals . Very early on I picked up Dust Covers , Arkham Asylum and Signal to Noise and proceeded to visually dissect them , trying to figure out how he did what he did . <p> In all honesty , back in 1995 Dave McKean played a HUGE role in me pursuing a creative career . I wanted to do what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Graphic Design in my hometown of Truro where I was introduced to Photoshop , a tool that definitely answered a few questions regarding McKeans creative execution . I started experimenting almost immediately with photography , drawing and other mediums to see how I could blend them together the way he did . Here is a few pieces of my older work created between 1998 2003 : <p> As you can see , McKeans influence stuck with me for over a decade and his work really pushed me to now only study how Photoshop worked but how other mediums work as well . Being an aspiring artist and designer at the time , I could n't have asked for a better kick in the ass . I looked at his work daily for years and still flip through his many books Ive acquired . <p> It kind of makes me weepy looking back at McKeans work from the 90s , I spent so many hours flipping through his material back then . I remember sitting on the patio at my parents place in 94 reading Arkham Asylum , and flipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about melted my face off . <p> Always remember who influenced you at important times in your life . Those are the turning points , man . <p> I did n't  really understand the value of Dribbble when I first got an invitation , but have since started using the service a bit more and am really enjoying it . Dribbble acts as a work-in-progress showcase where you upload a little snapshot of what you have on the go to either be a teaser or to acquire valuable feedback from other creative types . Its a lot of fun , and I 'm enjoying getting some behind-the-scenes glimpses at other peoples work . <p> Feel free to check out the Signalnoise Dribbble account . Ill be experimenting with the service over the next while to show previews and other fun stuff happening at the studio . <p> Tune into Signalnoise Broadcast 12 this coming Thursday at 3pm EST for a Signalnoise Special Presentation . This week I will be switching up the format from the usual QA session to a more focused discussion broken up into 2 sections . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week dealing with industry stuff and client work , but let 's take a break from that area and concentrate on what WE are working on , you know , the things we do on our own time because we love it . Let 's talk about your personal blogs , design work , illustrations , whatever you may be working on . Alternatively , what is the project you would like to work on in the future ? Think about your plans and questions and let 's talk about personal projects . <p> 2 . The New Signalnoise Project Additionally , near the end of the broadcast I will be talking about my new personal Signalnoise project that I 've been working on for the past month , and I 'll have some things to show you guys . I wont be recording this segment of the BroadcastI changed my mind and will indeed keep the recording going . Given different timezones , Canada Day obligations and other things , its not fair that some will be left out of the loop . here 's a word straight from the jerk in charge , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the scoop , should be a great time . Tune in live on Thursday , July 1st at 3pm EST for A Signalnoise Special Presentation . <p> PS . Regarding the suit , my original idea was to make that video preview like an awkward news cast . I then lost interest in the idea and decided to do a normal recording , but left the suit on . I 'm enjoying the " What 's with the suit ? " questions . <p> Here are some great concept designs by Weta for the film District 9 , the same creative company who worked on movies like Lord of the Rings , King Kong , Narnia , Avatar , the list goes on . I love watching all the behind-the-scenes footage on my Lord of the Rings DVDs to get a glimpse of their amazing studio and the people who work there . <p> Even though I do n't  research this kind of work all the time , I 've always had a fascination with the world of concept design , especially the tech stuff like architecture , weapons , vehicles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet still maintain some sense of usability and practicality is simply amazing . I have no idea how these guys can create such intricate designs on a blank canvas using nothing but Photoshop and a tablet . Just look at the detail in those gun designs . <p> Just a little note for all my Twitter pals out there . As of yesterday , my Twitter username has been switched to a much more efficient form . You can now find me via the handle @Signalnoise . As you can well imagine , I 'm pretty excited to have my Twitter name sync up properly with my online identity . Now all I need to do is reprint all my business cards . <p> So if you are using any programs that require you to make the switch manually , make sure you can properly find me in the Twitterverse . <p> If you missed out on tuning in live yesterday for Signalnoise Broadcast 11 , here is the recorded version . I was disappointed when Ustream dropped my recording after 30 minutes or something , so unfortunately this is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shorter watch , but still a good time . <p> Once again we talked about a range of topics , like dealing with a creative block , the importance of drawing , project software like Basecamp , the power of using a tablet , the meaning of " horse hockey " , inspiration vs. imitation , basic design skill-sets and a lot more fun stuff . So if you missed the live version , check it out right here . <p> If you are anything like me and you have your personal logo for use on your website or whatever , you probably just have one version saved in an AI document . You open it whenever needed and adapt it on the fly to whatever you might be using it for . I did the same thing for years . <p> However , with the new Signalnoise project I 'm working on I realized that was n't going to cut it . I will be needing to send my logo to other people for use across a few different mediums , on different colors , using a different colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking these questions and creating the logo per task . That eats up a lot of time , so I spent a little while thinking about my identity and creating different versions for use in these situations , in the form of a basic identity AI document . <p> Some of you might have learned about Brand Standards Manuals in school , where you create a book of rules and regulations on how the logo will be used . You might not need to do it to that extent for your personal identity , but its good general practice to think about these alternate variations of your identity and create them in one document . Not only will it point out problems ( like color variations ) , but it will create a nice accessible library you can grab quickly or send to those who might need it . Think about things like : will you be printing on black or white ? Will your logo be 1-color or full color ? Will there be a wordmark or just an icon ? Its interesting stuff , and will certainly strengthen your personal identity . 
@@121792041 @10792041/ <h> 80s Skateboard Art : Vision <p> I 've never spent too much time on a skateboard , aside from a few brief stints in the late 80s ( all of which ended in complete and total failure ) . Geography certainly played a role , as Western New York has never been confused with Southern California as a skateboarding hotbed , but at its peak in the 80s almost every kid in my neighborhood owned a skateboard . I was a year or two behind the curve when it came to the " scene " , but the older kids relentlessly rocked those neon-colored boards up and down my street all summer long . <p> Recently , I watched- Stoked : The Rise and Fall of Gator , a documentary about the roller coaster life of former Vision frontman Mark " Gator " Rogowski. - His Vision Gator series was everywhere when I was a kid and almost everyone I knew had one of his signature boards with that distinct spiral pattern on it . Its amazing how someone can go from so high to so low in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all interested in 80s subculture . <p> Watching Stoked got me reminiscing about those old board designs and I began scanning the web for imagery from back then , especially the Vision gear which I remember most clearly . Ads , decks , etc. , there was just so much that it actually defined skateboarding for a short period . <p> As Vision grew , they branched out into other sports and started an infamous street wear clothing line . Predictably , once the company- became too mainstream and commercialized , the skateboard subculture rejected it . The backlash was quick and lethal to the Vision brand . Some kids were turned off by the corporate image and stopped skating altogether , others went underground , those who still wore Vision gear were simply cast off as sell-outs . Vision became a parody of itself . <p> Its a cautionary tale for independent brands whose audience has a distinct counterculture base : do n't  alienate your core audience , do n't  betray their loyalty and devotion , do n't  forget your roots . It seems like simple formula , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Vision still exists to this day , but as a mere ghost of its former identity . Just like the once great " Gator " himself , Visions heydays have passed them by , the height of their success forever shackled to the decade that originally made them .

He started creating film posters around 1975 and worked very consistently throughout the 80s and 90s creating more the 150 posters during his career . He worked with many huge movie franchises creating a visual identity for the movies through his still images and compositions . Where would movies like Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Back to the Future and Big Trouble in Little China be without their iconic Struzan posters ? <p> Everyone I introduce Struzans work to eventually say the same thing : " He did THAT poster too ? ! " <p> I could go on and on about his work , but I wanted to make this post for a very specific and personal reason . I recently picked up his latest book , The Art of Drew Struzan from the kind folks at Strange Adventures and read it in one sitting . The book is packed with process sketches , previous versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s worked on , the crazy pitfalls that happened , and those special jobs where he collaborated with directors . As most artists trying to make a living in the creative realm , Drew is no stranger to client nightmares and the silliness of corporate Hollywood . The book is honest , Drew holds nothing back . <p> It might be odd of me to say that these stories ( both good and bad ) are inspiring , but there 's another level at work here . Most of the people who visit my blog are artists or designers , like me . Were doing our best to use our abilities to make nice things as best we can , and in order to do that and get paid we need to be hired . Sometimes that works out well , and sometimes it does n't  . Drew Struzan is in the same boat as the rest of us . Its easy to see his work and the people he s worked with and make assumptions involving thrones and riches , but he s a working man . Just like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his story is remarkably down to earth . I approached Drew about doing an interview for the blog . He was understandably too busy , but I did receive a very nice email in return . Its amazing to learn that your hero is a nice guy . <p> I highly recommend picking up The Art of Drew Struzan for the fantastic art , the insightful process and the stories . <h> 7 Comments <p> Growing up in Italy I never knew about Drew Struzan until you mentioned him and yes , I said " He did all of those posters ? ! " <p> As we commented on Twitter , its sad to see how Hollywood has taken his work and stripped it of all composition , storytelling and emotion to focus solely on badly photoshopped headshots of the current star . <p> Its reassuring to know that there are people like you out there who are trying to bring quality back to the art of poster design .

When I 'm creating my posters or sketching my little characters it feels like it could be 1983 all over again . I was 6 , sitting at the top of the stairs and drawing on all the typewriter paper in the house . From 80 to 85 my family lived on the military base in Kingston , Ontario . <p> Every few months I log into Google Earth to look at the old- neighborhood . Trees that are still there , parking lots me and my friends would drive our BMXs through , tracing my walk from home to the nearby Lundys Lane Elementary School . Our time in Kingston was one of the best of my life . We had so much fun . <p> Feeling a bit nostalgic this morning , I dropped into Google Earth to have a look at the old house . To my surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the block had been torn down in recent months . Couldnt believe it . In my head I figured that house would last forever . Big and strong . I had planned on making a trip to Kingston to walk around the- neighborhood- and re-trace my walk to school which I had n't  done in 27 years . Guess I should have gone sooner . Geez , I can still hear the distinctive sound the cupboard doors made when they closed . <p> Today is the day DRIVE is released on Blu-Ray in North America , and to celebrate one of the most talked-about movies of 2011 Signalnoise and Mystery Box has put together a little package of goodies available to download . <p> Since a lot of people will be grabbing the Blu-Ray today , included in the download you will get a PDF version of my own DRIVE Blu-Ray sleeve design all ready for print .

Done . <p> Along with the Blu-Ray cover we have included a couple of iPhone and iPad wallpapers to sweeten the deal . Add some hot pink to your favorite mobile device . Enjoy ! <p> The Heidelberg tried to literally define " hot pink " with this small mishap . <p> Here is a little video I cut together after visiting Bounty Print- this morning to sign-off on my DRIVE poster . They fired up the Heidelberg press when I was there so I shot a bit of footage . Amazing to see this beast of a press firing off my poster . The thing is bigger than my house . <p> The DRIVE poster launches on January 19 , one week from today .

@@121792061 @10792061/ <p> Last week I released my version of the Green Lantern movie poster ( seen above ) , which I worked on in the studio over the course of 2 days from sketch to final . It was a lot of fun to create something based on my childhood hero , so I took care in keeping as much material as I could in order to show how I went about creating the design . So now , its time to look at the Green Lantern poster process . <p> Back in 1983 whenever me and the neighborhood kids played Superfriends , I was always Green Lantern because I thought he had the coolest powers . I even went to the extent of making my own little Green Lantern power rings out of paper , not until this one right here : <p> Outside of thinking his powers were cool and his ring iconic , Lantern has the best logo in the DC Universe aside from the staples of Superman and Batman . All of these aspects of the character led to a bit of disappointment when I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan Reynolds , and its complete lack of showing Lanterns ring . I wont get into a big rant about the industry as I 'd be preaching to the choir . Modern film posters are n't  geared around art and design anymore , they revolve around whoever is starring in these things in hopes of drawing fans of the actors , unfortunately not the content . <p> Just to be clear , I 'm not riffing on the quality of the official poster because its beautifully crafted . I just feel the essence and iconic elements of the character was lost under the need to showcase Reynolds . That 's all . <p> So I took it upon myself to design a poster the way I would want to see it , focusing on Lanterns iconic power ring , its logo and the classic Green Lantern costume ( or at least a portion of it ) . Let 's get rockin. <h> i . Sketching <p> Like I 've said many times on my broadcasts I start every project with the sketchbook , I started drawing up come rough ideas of how I might approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring , but wanted to do something strong , iconic yet simple . Since the ring is actually really small , I needed a way of making it look interesting and powerful . After doodling up around 10 sketches , I decided the way to go was simply showing Lanterns fist raised in the air with green light energy shooting out . <p> I 'm sure the redesigned Lantern costume for the movie will look cool onscreen , but you just cant beat the classic design . Hal Jordans white gloves were a must as the green ring contrasts beautifully on white , it just makes sense from a design standpoint . Shown here are a few of the reference images I dug up online , the Superpowers figure from 1984 ( which I still own ) , the cover design for New Frontier #6 created by Darwyn Cooke and an Alex Ross painting because I love those green lights . <p> In the case of the fist design , I really wanted to capture what Darwyn did on New Frontier . His hands are typically 2-color yet have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these references gathered along with my sketches , I had a good concept and direction going but I knew the biggest problem I would hit : where was this gloved fist going to come from ? <h> ii . Reference photos <p> After looking around some stock photo sites for hands and fists , I knew I was never going to find a good looking hand at the proper angle . Everything I found had something wrong with it , plus there was the issue of getting a ring on there . I decided I 'd do it myself and take some photos using my own hand to get exactly the angle I needed . I even had my own Green Lantern ring on hand thanks to my pals at Strange Adventures . <p> My photo set-up was hilarious . I grabbed my Canon Powershot , my Rock Band mic stand and a dollar store flashlight pointed at the ring to match the lighting I wanted in the final poster . It worked great and I snapped a number of shots in a few different poses in case a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fist was still the winner . <h> iii . Digital sketch <p> This next step is what I call the digital sketch . After working on a number of posters over the years I found myself naturally gravitating to this middle step between the sketchbook and building the final design , where I build a pre-viz rough version of how the composition might be . I use pre-made elements that work as well as elements I 'll be using later in the final . <p> In this digital sketch for the Lantern poster , I used one of the hand photos I took in the previous step , a bunch of lighting effects I had on hand and some cosmic imagery from NASAs website . My concern was n't making the glove or anything look convincing , moreso to have a quick study to ensure I was still on the right creative path . My initial idea was to use more blues in the background to make the green energy stand out , but it made the palette look bleached out . I wanted bold green everywhere . I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the glove . <p> This step took a few hours to nail down , but it was hugely helpful before I moved on to creating the final poster build . Now that my planning was complete , it was time to start building my elements . <h> iv . Pencils and vectors <p> Ill be the first to admit , I kind of painted myself into a corner with this part . My goal was to make the fist look physical with weight and definition , but I did n't  want it to look like a photograph OR an illustration . Yeah , easy task huh ? I had to build and rip apart the hand design 3 times over before I got the process down and could achieve the effect I wanted . Even tried one version where I digitally painted the entire thing , it looked awful . I had to go analog , man . <p> I printed off a copy of the fist photograph and grabbed my handy tracing paper . I taped everything down on my sketch table and drew the basic outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account the glove , highlights and shadows . I tried to do this step in Illustrator but it was far too much guesswork , I needed to pull it away from the computer and do this step by hand to have complete control . <p> I then scanned the pencils , brought the drawing into Illustrator and mapped out all the elements in vector while experimenting with every gradient in there . The drawing was HUGELY helpful , something I 'll be taking into account with future posters . It was a great mix of realism and illustration and even looked like Hals hand . <p> The ring was the easy part . Having a plastic ring onhand was a big help , but it was just a matter of matching the perspective and hitting the right combination of selective gradients. <h> v. Bringing it all together <p> Things got a bit tricky here . Despite the gradient work , the vectors still looked really flat and I wanted something more substantial to give strength to the fist . I managed to achieve this by blending a couple of photographic overlays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image above , I used a green tint and a greyscale version of my fist and set them to Overlay in Photoshop . This gave the otherwise flat vectors a more physical look , like there was a human hand in there somewhere . Its totally an illusion but it created the effect I wanted . <p> I could n't get the proper fabric folds in Illustrator that I needed , this was a glove afterall , so I searched around Thinkstock and got some nice images of folded linen and satin which worked perfect for getting those wrinkles . I changed the images to either green or greyscale , and laid them over the vectors using blending modes Multiply and Soft Light . They worked great , kind of a fluke . <p> After the fist was built , it was just a matter of adding the green light energy , a few background elements and some selective shading . I 'm not going to get too deep into how these were created because there are a bazillion tutorials online showing cool light effects , but mine were created using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had onhand of flares and lights . Most of these lights were switched to greyscale , then I overlayed some green on top to keep things more dynamic . It involved a lot of experimentation . <p> And finally , I added the final content from the Green Lantern oath as well as the 2011 logo , eluding to the release of the upcoming film . Done ! <p> The process behind this poster was extremely different then what I 'm used to , but it was an excellent journey to nail down the effect I wanted . Having to create that hand from scratch was a strange one , but I 'm happy to say its ME wearing that Green Lantern ring . Yeah ! I hope you had a good time gaining a bit of insight behind this poster because I had a great time creating it . Now if you do n't  mind , I 'm going to don my mask on and bounce off the rings of Saturn . <p> Here it is , the Signalnoise version of a Green Lantern film poster . Its been my intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upcoming Lantern movie , I even had the idea suggested to me by a few friends and folks online . So I grabbed a few hours over the last three days and dove into the creation of this Green Lantern poster . 100% fan-based , not official at all . <p> I created this poster because back in 1983 when me and the other neighborhood kids decided to play Superfriends , my choice character was always the Green Lantern while they were fighting over who got to play Batman . I had some hand-me-down comics that featured the Lantern and I always thought he had the coolest power , manifesting whatever he could think of in any situation . Plus , that ring was by far the coolest accessory and I even went as far as to make my own little paper rings complete with the Green Lantern logo crudely drawn on . No joke , I was 6 . <p> The Lantern in this design is obviously not the Ryan Reynolds version . They modernized his costume for the film with neat effects and all that which I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic Hal Jordan version with the nicely designed black and green cloth and white gloves . Here is the Superpowers toy version circa 1984 as well as an Alex Ross Green Lantern . <p> I honestly believe the Green Lantern logo in terms of design is ranked at third across the entire DC Universe trumped only by Superman and Batman , and the ring is by far the most iconic element of this hero . Which is why I was baffled when this poster was released and the ring is nowhere to be found . Say what ? <p> This was a convoluted process making this poster and involved some photography , a lot of vector work then a lot of Photoshop effects and texturing . I wanted it to look like an illustration but have the depth of a photograph . Ill be writing a making of poster hopefully for launch Monday to give you a behind-the-scene look at the process and inspirations behind this Green Lantern poster . Stay tuned for that one . <p> If you missed out on tuning in to Signalnoise Broadcast 32 yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ustream Producer , I have the ability to broadcast my desktop to show some workflow which is something I did n't  know I could do ( idiot , I know ) .

I spent a good 40 minutes trying to get it to work while keeping everyone informed via audio , but it was to no avail . I managed to find an alternative method the following day , so Signalnoise Broadcast 31 was on Friday , not Thursday . <p> But , it seems that I came out on top . To fix the problem I installed Ustream Producer , which has a bunch of nice features that the web version never had , including the ability to switch to other videos , images and screencast as I do things live .

As I keep working on these shirt designs and jotting down ideas I keep gravitating toward taking things from my past ( toys , movies , video games ) and adding some distinct heavy metal elements , and I believe this idea came out of a late-night nerdy conversation with my pal Jerko . I like wearing funny things on my chest , and the combo of retro nerdiness and heavy metal makes me laugh . This design falls in line with my previous Black Metal Busters and Metalego t-shirts . <p> Ive been asked by more than a fair share of ladies inquiring when there will be t-shirts catering to the female crowd . Well , I 'm going to look into offering some lady-sizes with this design to see if its in the cards . <p> More to come as I move forward , and watch the blog for some more preview as I bang the designs out . <p> The past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the midst of moving , but I 'm happy to say we are getting settled and the new place is starting to look nice and habitable . That being said , its time to get back at the blog and get some updates posted on what has been happening . Here we go . <p> This past Thursday was my good pal Cal Johnsons birthday . Cal is the owner of the best comic store in the world , Strange Adventures ( Twitter ) here in Halifax . His wife Sandy approached me about doing a custom shirt design for Cal and the store , and how could I refuse ? After waffling on the idea a bit , I decided to make a design based on the old Batman logo from the 70s , but alter it to feature the store and their mascot , Super Snipe . Here is the original and a shot of the mascot drawn by my pal Dave Howlett : <p> Batman logo from the 1970s . <p> Super Snipe by Dave Howlett . <p> A big happy birthday to Cal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gang if you ever visit Halifax . Its a must-see venue . <p> Here are some really nice examples of glossy retro type designs coming from Spanish artist Marta Cerd+ Alimbau in a project called Do n't  Believe the Type . I came across these a few days ago and was instantly grabbed by how closely these resemble old sticker designs that were prevalent when I was a kid . Kinda ugly and hilarious yet awesome at the same time . However , designs aside , there is a very appropriate message happening with this project that can only be described by the artist herself : <p> " I tried to make a tacky , kitsch , vulgar and acid piece , where we can read some lines of the world we are living in . Very aged and retro , as if it was part of an old ridiculous civilization , already dead . We try to make letters beautiful , more attractive , more visible , when many times conscious or not , the content of the message were working on is totally wrong . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful typographical piece , its more a personal reflection . " <p> Here is the recorded version of Signalnoise Broadcast 22 , with a focus on Photoshop and Illustrator . I enjoy doing the topic-based discussions because it adds a nice framework to the broadcasts , so this time I wanted to talk about the programs I use the most . <p> This was a lot of fun , and quite challenging taking questions about the specifics of these programs . I did n't  realize that my usage of these programs is so second nature at this point , that I had to really think about the questions to remember what tools I use on the fly . Remembering specific shortcuts and palettes was hard , but a really interesting exercise . We went over all kinds of topics such as working with vectors , working with color for print , my favorite shortcuts , and I even showed some of my old paintings . Good times . <p> So , have a watch and be sure to tune in next week , Thursday at 3pm EST . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was a bit late catching on to the cartoon because I rarely watch television , most of my viewing is on DVD , but was instantly taken by the sound and design of the show . The pacing is unlike anything Ive seen in a cartoon , to the point where Im surprised kids remained interested after 2-minute stints of Jack walking through a forest with nothing but the sound of wind . Genndy Tartakovsky really nailed the style on this unique toon . <p> One of my favorite parts of the series are the beautiful landscape backgrounds , they are all different in palette and design yet fit together nicely as a set . Here are a bunch of images grabbed from Pumml , the art blog of Drake Brodahl . Be sure to check out all of his awesome Samurai Jack posts , the amount of art he covers is staggering . Seriously , any of these images would make a beautiful framed print . Enjoy . According to Drake , these were done by Dan Krall , Scott Wills and Jenny Gase-Baker .

I enjoy doing these theme-based broadcasts , and there is nothing more fun then talking about my line of silly shirts . I did this discussion in hopes to lend some advice to those who want to start making their own shirts but do n't  know where to begin . We had a great time talking apparel and cracking jokes .

It does n't  matter what I 'm working on and what the final medium might be , I always start with roughing up ideas in my sketchbook before going near the computer . For me , it helps clear my head without the worry of " multitasking " and forces me to focus on one thing and one idea . <p> Here are a bunch of drawings I created over the past couple of weeks , which some of you might have caught on my Twitter . Naturally , I 'm always thinking about new fun t-shirt ideas I can throw into the mix , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look on a shirt and what peoples reactions might be if they saw someone wearing it . I constantly get compliments on my Black Metal Busters shirt whenever I wear it , so a few of these are exploring the idea of taking characters from my youth ( 1980s ) and melding them with metal . The idea just makes me laugh when people recognize the characters . <p> Will all of these make it to t-shirts ? Well , probably not as I 'm sure there are some kind of copyrights involved especially with Maidens Eddie , since I did n't  change his design at all . But maybe I can get Bruce and the boys onboard . Who knows ? <h> Signalnoise Broadcast 21 : Starting your t-shirt line <p> That being said , I 'd like to throw a small plug for tomorrows Signalnoise Broadcast .

@@121792063 @10792063/ <h> 80s Skateboard Art : Vision <p> I 've never spent too much time on a skateboard , aside from a few brief stints in the late 80s ( all of which ended in complete and total failure ) . Geography certainly played a role , as Western New York has never been confused with Southern California as a skateboarding hotbed , but at its peak in the 80s almost every kid in my neighborhood owned a skateboard . I was a year or two behind the curve when it came to the " scene " , but the older kids relentlessly rocked those neon-colored boards up and down my street all summer long . <p> Recently , I watched- Stoked : The Rise and Fall of Gator , a documentary about the roller coaster life of former Vision frontman Mark " Gator " Rogowski. - His Vision Gator series was everywhere when I was a kid and almost everyone I knew had one of his signature boards with that distinct spiral pattern on it . Its amazing how someone can go from so high to so low in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all interested in 80s subculture . <p> Watching Stoked got me reminiscing about those old board designs and I began scanning the web for imagery from back then , especially the Vision gear which I remember most clearly . Ads , decks , etc. , there was just so much that it actually defined skateboarding for a short period . <p> As Vision grew , they branched out into other sports and started an infamous street wear clothing line . Predictably , once the company- became too mainstream and commercialized , the skateboard subculture rejected it . The backlash was quick and lethal to the Vision brand . Some kids were turned off by the corporate image and stopped skating altogether , others went underground , those who still wore Vision gear were simply cast off as sell-outs . Vision became a parody of itself . <p> Its a cautionary tale for independent brands whose audience has a distinct counterculture base : do n't  alienate your core audience , do n't  betray their loyalty and devotion , do n't  forget your roots . It seems like simple formula , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Vision still exists to this day , but as a mere ghost of its former identity . Just like the once great " Gator " himself , Visions heydays have passed them by , the height of their success forever shackled to the decade that originally made them .

@@121792066 @10792066/ <h> The Art of Drew Struzan <p> If you grew up in the 1980s then I 'm sure the work of american painter Drew Struzan was not far from sight . He started creating film posters around 1975 and worked very consistently throughout the 80s and 90s creating more the 150 posters during his career . He worked with many huge movie franchises creating a visual identity for the movies through his still images and compositions . Where would movies like Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Back to the Future and Big Trouble in Little China be without their iconic Struzan posters ? <p> Everyone I introduce Struzans work to eventually say the same thing : " He did THAT poster too ? ! " <p> I could go on and on about his work , but I wanted to make this post for a very specific and personal reason . I recently picked up his latest book , The Art of Drew Struzan from the kind folks at Strange Adventures and read it in one sitting . The book is packed with process sketches , previous versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s worked on , the crazy pitfalls that happened , and those special jobs where he collaborated with directors . As most artists trying to make a living in the creative realm , Drew is no stranger to client nightmares and the silliness of corporate Hollywood . The book is honest , Drew holds nothing back . <p> It might be odd of me to say that these stories ( both good and bad ) are inspiring , but there 's another level at work here . Most of the people who visit my blog are artists or designers , like me . Were doing our best to use our abilities to make nice things as best we can , and in order to do that and get paid we need to be hired . Sometimes that works out well , and sometimes it does n't  . Drew Struzan is in the same boat as the rest of us . Its easy to see his work and the people he s worked with and make assumptions involving thrones and riches , but he s a working man . Just like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his story is remarkably down to earth . I approached Drew about doing an interview for the blog . He was understandably too busy , but I did receive a very nice email in return . Its amazing to learn that your hero is a nice guy . <p> I highly recommend picking up The Art of Drew Struzan for the fantastic art , the insightful process and the stories . <h> 7 Comments <p> Growing up in Italy I never knew about Drew Struzan until you mentioned him and yes , I said " He did all of those posters ? ! " <p> As we commented on Twitter , its sad to see how Hollywood has taken his work and stripped it of all composition , storytelling and emotion to focus solely on badly photoshopped headshots of the current star . <p> Its reassuring to know that there are people like you out there who are trying to bring quality back to the art of poster design .

They were a Transformers spin-off in Japan , but Hasbro decided not to tie into that continuity with their own marketing . The mid 80s was a time when many toys had some sort of gimmick to help sell them , in this case , each Battle Beast had a heat sensitive sticker on its chest that revealed either fire , wood , or water . A sort of paper , rock , scissors in toy form .

Unfortunately , somewhere along the road to adulthood my collection must have landed in the trash . The same old sad story . When I took a quick peek on eBay for some of these figures , I was astonished at how much they are going for . Like adding salt to the wound . While it does n't  seem as if I 'll be scooping up any replacements anytime soon , at least Ive got the memories . <p> Yea Greg , for some reason I hated Visionaries as a kid , maybe because every time I went looking for new G.I.

Cmon people , maintain those sources for morons like me ! <p> Hope you 're all enjoying some down time and eating some turkey , wherever you may be . <p> Like a lot of movie poster designers , I watch a lot of releases online to see what my favorite companies and artists are up to . I love this scene that still really feels like the wild west , where all these rascals are dreaming up new ways to portray their favorite movies in the screen-printed form . And like many , I enjoy watching new and upcoming Mondo releases . I was thrilled to see a full-on art show featuring the work of Australian-based art duo WE BUY YOUR KIDS . <p> I was captivated by their WRATH OF KHAN poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly hunting down the image online to " have another look " . So arty and psychedelic and weird . But the biggest reason I enjoy it is because it looks nothing like other Mondo releases .

So strange and amazing . <p> When images started surfacing from the WE BUY YOUR KIDS art show , I knew a blog post was in order . They dropped a few posters online yesterday and I managed to nab a CONAN which I 'm pretty stoked about . Mondo tends to sell out of posters in seconds , but this drop took a little more time . Bit slower than usual . I like that . Its by no means a sign that this is of lesser quality than other Mondo releases , but rather its straight up different and out there .

I 'm a big fan of people putting a cool modern spin on my childhood favorites while keeping the energy and flavour of the franchise intact . Tom and Dave have done just that . Love these . <p> Growing up I would draw my favorite cartoon characters all the time .

Nintendo took great care in tuning his image from way back in 1981 when he first appeared in Donkey Kong , keeping all of his iconic elements intact . Cap , coveralls and- mustache . All basic shapes . I 'm sure marketing types came along who wanted to " re-design Mario to capture a new hipper audience " , but Nintendo stayed true to their little hero despite the advancements in technology and gameplay . I sure respect that . <p> So I put this post together as a point blank documentation of his design evolution . There are zillions of Mario games out there but I wanted to only show the main titles that advanced his design , so do n't  get on me for omitting Paper Mario or the RPG , you nerds . <p> So this one is for you , Mario .

Not only does he typically design posters based around content that I 'm into ( Snoopy , big robots , etc ) , but just look at the technical skill put into these things . <p> Durieux has an incredible ability to shade his drawings in a way that gives a sense of volume . Gives the illusion of 3-dimensional space even though he s using a limited palette . No effects or blurs , just hard shading . His cross-hatching and line-shade skill is off the charts , have no idea how he does this stuff with such precision . And he can do type work . <p> Recently , while tooling around the internet in search of Computer Magazine cover art , I was blindsided by this tidal wave of nostalgia : Atari Age Magazine . <p> Like any self-respecting child of the early 80s , I was the proud owner of an Atari 2600 ( thanks mom &amp; dad ) .

I first saw Toms work when his official poster for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN emerged about a year ago and have been frequenting his site ever since to see what he s been up to . My favorite of his might be that- DEAR GOD NO ! - poster above . His work is fantastic and crazy , really dives into- independent- VHS cover art from the 80s back when covers and posters meant something . <p> But , were living in an interesting time right now . With the rise of artists like Tom , Olly Moss , Phantom City Creative , La Boca , Tyler Stout and the platform Mondo has built , we are seeing more attention being brought back to the art of the movie poster which has for too long been ruled by Photoshopped floating heads .

Hands were shaking as I unwrapped these things and piled them on my drawing table to get them signed and snap a few shots. - Theres #1 of 20 right there . <p> Like I said , this is an unofficial run which ends right here at these 20 sitting on my desk . A few VIPs are getting them , along with the 3 winners of the DRIVE Poster Giveaway over on Abduzeedo . If you have n't entered , get over there and drop a comment . <p> And finally with a little luck , there might be some more interesting news to come . Stay tuned <p> Upon the recommendation of several friends , namely Jason " Hobo With a Shotgun " Eisener , I finally sat down last week to watch DRIVE . The movie was said to be highly stylized and quite a surprise in its execution and originality . It didnt- disappoint , loved every second . Every once in a while a movie appears where midway through I think- " Man , I 'd love to design a poster for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I got to it . <p> Here is my unofficial poster for DRIVE , standing at an official 24 ? x 36 ? . I wanted to challenge myself to do something almost 100% digital paints , limited colour palette with very few effects . I used a similar process with my Hobo With - Shotgun poster , but streamlined everything this time around . Simplified the content . The film had a strong but modernized 80s vibe , and I really wanted to keep that flavour intact . Listened to a pile of Kavinsky during production hoping to infuse some Night Call into the design . <p> here 's a detail shot : <p> A couple of studies I created while planning things out : <p> This poster has been sent to the print shop and I 'm awaiting a proof as we speak . I 'm doing a super limited run to start things out , hand-signed and numbered . A handful are already spoken for by VIPs , but this Wednesday I 'll be announcing a giveaway to get a few of these posters into peoples hands , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you 've seen my Back to the Future presentation at any point this year you would have seen me tell the story of Hobo With a Shotgun and my involvement with the design of some of the elements . I 've posted about the film before and talked about it on my broadcasts several times , but up until now the full behind-the-scenes gear was only shown onstage . Its about time I retire that section of the presentation to launch it online for everyone to see . <p> Its my favorite story to tell , my favorite project in recent years , and best of all it was all done for friends in order to help them with their project . That 's what its all about . We support each other around these parts and Dartmouth blood is thick , especially when being splattered onscreen . I was thrilled when Jason Eisener and Rob Cotterill asked me to design a Hobo poster . While not being the official one used , it was a wildly entertaining challenge . So let 's load those barrels and get to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Full Rutger Hauer drawing , blue lead and ink . <p> Digital concept mock-up #1 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #2 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #3 . Boom ! <p> I knew early on that I was going to digitally paint the poster , something I 've been wanting to attempt for a while . A huge challenge , totally out of my comfort zone . Ive been a big fan of guys like Drew Struzan and Bob Peak for a long time , so doing something like that offered up some unique- obstacles- which- challenged- my entire proces . Before I got to building the actual poster in Photoshop , I needed to have things planned out properly and extensively . <p> Shown above are my original concept sketches and digital mock-ups . I even went as far as doing a meticulous drawing of Rutger Hauer to get myself in the groove of capturing likeness in Photoshop . Again , something I 'm pretty unfamiliar with . The digital mock-ups were unsuccessful from a design standpoint , but man , I still love that one of the Hobo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . <p> Palette samples . <p> The great thing about working with the guys is they have a really specific style in mind , and they can express it in art samples . Crazy helpful . Shown above are some color examples Jason sent over that he used as inspiration for the lighting and palette of Hobo . Bright pinks and purples are top priority , which I did n't  know since I had n't  seen the film at this point . This really put me on the right path . Here are some digital mock-ups I put together with the new colours in mind . <p> Digital concept mock-up #4 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #5 . <p> I started some new mock-ups with the proper palette and vibe and things started to click . Again drawing on inspiration from Struzan , I collaged together some of the photos Jason sent over to get the composition nailed down . I can see a big Star Wars influence in there , which was fine since me and the Hobo guys are all kids of the 80s . VHS culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Sienkiewicz vibe in there too , I was looking at old Dazzler comic covers at the time . <p> Vector colour palette test . <p> Once the composition was coming along , I decided to do a vector colour study before moving onto the digital paints . Having the photos were great , but I wanted to dilute the composition to know exactly what my palette was going to be . So I got rid of the details and roughed up the above image using simple shapes to represent the areas . <p> I should also mention that you 're going to see changes in layout and characters as we go . The poster was a total work in progress in terms of what characters would go where , even during the final stages . <p> Starting in with the digital paints , blocking stuff in . <p> Close-up of paint progress . More texture and detailing . <p> After all that planning I was finally able to leap into Photoshop and start building the paints . I took a semester of foundation paint at a local art school back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that much I took from it some important techniques which lent itself quite well to Photoshop . I learned to block things in and layer colours on top of one another to build palettes and texture . Very helpful at this stage . <p> Shown above are my initial steps . Really rough and simple at t is point as I mapped things out . A big challenge was to let the brush in Photoshop act like paint . It was oksy to get a bit messy with it and let strokes fall outside the lines . It suited the content , yknow ? <p> Digital paint mid-point . <p> After many , many hours of digital painting the palette was starting to get away from me , as shown above . It did n't  have the life those initial compositions had and the colours were not near what I wanted . I did the " morning after " test , you know , when you sleep on it then wake up and hate what you 've done ? Yeah that . So I took an entire day , ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Added some new effects and dry brush textures to this thing . <p> By the end of the day , this is where I was : <p> Palette and atmosphere revision . <p> Now were talking . This was where I wanted to be . I dug it , the guys dug it . We were off to the races . <p> Final Hobo With a Shotgun poster . <p> So after a great many hours painting textures , splatters , characters , lighting and effects the final poster emerged . The scene changed as I went , but it captured that initial flavour we all really wanted . Something fun , and cool , which would be very happy on the cover of a sun-bleached VHS box . <p> In the end , even though this wasnt used as the official Hobo poster or box art , I would n't trade this project for the world . It was created for a killer movie , a killer Dartmouth movie , for my friends . And it offered up some real challenges which put me in a place I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this thing , about the medium and about myself as a creator .

I was intrigued by Joshs project right from the start and was sold when I read the script . Excellent story with an excellent execution . Ca n't wait to see this film for real . <p> This also gave me the opportunity to stretch my horror wings and create a poster on the darker end of the spectrum . Being an avid horror fan ( mostly of the 70s and 80s era ) Ive been wanting to do something like this for quite some time , so I was excited when this project dropped on me .

Here are a couple of progress shots as I worked out the composition : <p> I 'm sure you 'll be seeing more about GAME as news becomes available , but until then , why not check out the trailer to Joshs other movie , The Corridor which is currently being shown at film fests all over the place . <p> If you 've been following my Google+ page you would have seen me talking about this new piece over the past week . I was asked by the kind people at Advanced Photoshop Magazine to develop a design in order to break it down into a tutorial for the newest issue , so I set about building a new poster I call Creator . <p> here 's the thing . I have a very organic , or maybe crazy is a better word , method of conceiving and developing my artwork . I start out with an idea or concept then start chasing that image through my head by way of vectors , stock photography , personal assets and all the other nuts and bolts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill need to break it down into 18 easy-to-follow steps so readers can make their own piece . I cant even explain how difficult that is for me to do . I even had a few bad starts on the job , here are some initial concepts : <p> In the case of Creator , I made a stripped down version for publication in Advanced Photoshop , then after the deadline I continued working on it to realize my initial vision for the final . More details , lighting , color adjustments and all that . I tinkered with this for weeks after it was sent off and had a ball doing it . <p> On the left is the final image I sent off to Advanced Photoshop for the tutorial , and on the right is work-in-progress version of the poster as I kept working on it . You will see all kinds of little changes I was making as I went along , involving little details , color adjustments , highlights and all that . I even swapped out the gem for a Tron disc thing . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating around my head and sketchbooks for about a year , so I decided to get it out and make it real . It was about time to realize this thing , so here it is . Signalnoise : Cycle . <p> The reference of this design is obviously Olympic posters created back in the 1970s , mainly the 1972 Munich Olympic Games . All of that work was created by Otl Aicher . I wanted to create something more simple then my usual work , and show some restraint in the color palette and texturing . A challenge to say the least , since I 'm used to running hog wild through Photoshop and flinging lights all over the place . <p> This was a calmer process , I really enjoyed it . I 'm going to print this up in the next few days after a bit of mild adjustments . <p> The Cars franchise is the only work by Pixar I never got into , probably because it was created for kids who are into racing culture . Not really my thing . But I have to give some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cars 2 film . I especially like the James Bond looking one , second from the top . Good stuff .

The toys were cool , the cartoons were awesome , but the box art was the catalyst for daydreaming . Seeing that stuff on the shelves , looking at the hand-crafted portraits of the characters really got my mind going . The fact that these were actually painted , with all the textures and imperfections that come along with that process , really drove home a certain personality that is all but lost on kids today . <p> Excellent stuff . I am sure I have a Transformers sticker book cover somewhere with that great painted style . I think it was from the film/movie . I have the film on Blu-Ray and it really benefits from the improved colour palette . I love this era , you get some amazing covers to aid the imagination .

In 1983 , after releasing their self-titled album , Killers and Number of the Beast , Iron Maiden claimed the global metal thrown after going platinum in the US with the release of Piece of Mind . Only to follow with the epic Powerslave . I was 7 years old when Powerslave was released , so I was too wrapped up in toys and cartoons to notice when metal was the top selling genre on the planet . <p> Other then killer riffs , over the top solos and operatic vocals , Iron Maiden has another strength on their side which was the artwork of Derek Riggs .

@@121792076 @10792076/ <p> Here is an image I put together for a tutorial to be published in Digital Arts Magazine . This is a combination of a couple of previous poster designs and elements watered down so I can discuss the steps I took along the way . I mostly focused on using Blending Modes and using simple objects to yield cool results . <p> Look for this tutorial in an upcoming issue of Digital Arts , and I 'll be sure to announce when the issue is released . <p> I do n't  yet have photos of the actual magazine but the Elle tutorial I wrote for Digital Arts Magazine has been published on their website . The poster was originally designed for the crew at Thinkstock , who were kind enough to donate the photograph of the lady to this tutorial . The process is stripped down and broken into 16 steps , but the fundamentals of how I created this poster are there . <p> The tutorial is published in the July 2010 issue of Digital Arts Magazine , currently on newsstands in Europe . Enjoy ! <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month where I included a small and simple Photoshop tutorial on how I achieved the rainbow shard effect seen in many of my poster designs over the last few years . What I showed to the crowd was a stripped down version so I could demonstrate easily and quickly how the effect was created in about 4 minutes . We cant have only those who attended have all the fun , so here is the web version of the tutorial in the exact way I presented it at the conference . <p> But before we begin , please PLEASE try experimenting with various steps along the way . I understand tutorials are meant to be a map from point A to point B where you can create the exact results shown , but screw that . Try your own stuff , add images , change the shapes , switch up the colors . Anyone can read and follow instructions , its the exploration and playing that makes it your own and can lead down other creative paths . I endorse learning , not replicating . <p> Bear that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : In Adobe Illustrator , create some basic shapes using a few varying degrees of greys . Try to get a good range so they do n't  look so monotone . If you are looking to get things lining up later on , be sure to hold down the Shift key while making these so all lines are perfectly horizontal , vertical or 45- . <p> Experiment tip ! After you 've run through this tutorial once , try creating some other shapes to play with later on . Its super fun , trust me . <p> Step 2 : I originally used Flash in order to create these random little groups , but you really do n't  have to . Take the shapes you created in Step 1 and make a few groups with a variety of size and dispersal . Take a bit of time here to play with the shapes and get the groups looking as random and interesting as possible . If you are adjusting lengths , be sure to hold down the Shift key to maintain that 45- angle so things line up properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here because it will hurt you later . The more interesting the groups are here will improve depth later . Try using different shapes and arrangements to see what results they might yield . Think of these groups as your tools , the better they are the better they will work for you . <p> Step 3 : Copy and paste 2 of the groups you just created into Photoshop onto a black canvas , then drop the opacity of these layers down to 50% each . Expand the size of the shapes a bit so they bleed off . You can set the dimensions of the canvas to whatever you like , I just chose this format because my it was for my Keynote presentation . <p> Step 4 : Copy and paste 2 more groups of shapes into Photoshop on top of the previous ones from Step 3 . Again , expand the groups so they bleed off the edges of the canvas . <p> Step 5 : Set the Blending Mode of those 2 new layers of shapes to Overlay . You should now be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those underneath . <p> Experiment tip ! Try adding as many layers as you wish to this step . Also try adjusting the scale and opacity of the shapes to see what happens . <p> Step 6 : Now its time to add color . Create a new layer , select a full spectrum linear gradient and apply it across the canvas . I then selected the shapes below in order to apply a layer mask to the color layer . Looks pretty gross , huh ? <p> Experiment tip ! Try using different colors , radial gradients or using the airbrush tool to create custom color fills . <p> Step 7 : Set the Blending Mode of the color layer to Overlay , and set the opacity to around 35% . This coloring does n't  look too interesting but there is a method of applying color I discovered quite by accident , which is by way of layering colors over top of one another <p> Step 8 : Duplicate the color layer 3 times so you have 4 layers of color . This will improve the saturation of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to adjust the opacities of your color layers individually of they are reacting too harshly with one another . I included my layers palette in this image to show you how I have things set up so far . <p> Here is the clean version of Step 8 . <p> Step 9 : Now we are going to add some subtle highlights and shading to the shapes in order to create a bit more dimension . Create a new layer and set the Blending Mode to Overlay . Select the gradient tool with a setting of white to transparent , and apply a radial gradient to the upper-right corner . Do the same steps and apply a black radial gradient to the lower-left corner . You can adjust the opacity of this overlay if the highlight or shadow are too harsh . <p> Experiment tip ! Try using this method of highlight and shadow in different areas to either bring elements forward or knock parts back . It can add quite a bit of dimension to your work . <p> And there you go , nothing to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you can understand the possibility of experimentation particularly in the early steps . Its nothing to just follow instructions to yield to same outcome , the real power comes from playing with elements along the way to see what results might come about . <p> So have fun , and feel free to post your creations in the comments . I 'd love to see what you come up with . <p> If you somehow missed picking up issue #156 of Computer Arts magazine , which contains my tutorial entitled Creating the New Retro , it is now available as a PDF download from the Computer Arts website . You can check it out right here : <p> I received my fresh copy of Computer Arts #156 in the mail a few days ago , which contains the tutorial I wrote entitled Creating the New Retro . <p> As I previewed earlier on the site , the tutorial walks through the steps taken to create the piece above outlining my process behind creating the retro-style colored lines prevalent in my artwork . Its always a pleasure to work with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great opportunity . <p> The issue should be available worldwide now , just watch for the killer cover designed by Hvass&amp;Hannibal . <p> I 'm happy to announce that the latest installment of Computer Arts magazine , issue 156 has been released and features the tutorial I wrote entitled Creating the New Retro . This tutorial walks through the process behind creating the image above , minus text and logos , and explains the techniques used to produce the layered colored line aesthetic in 15 steps . Check it out in the Technique section of the mag . <p> I have had many requests for tutorials over the past months , but given that they are quite time-consuming to create I have stayed away from them to continue with my poster designs and freelance work . <p> Last week I posted a few images entitled The O Series. - The process behind the images is fairly simple and I thought it would make for a good first tutorial post . There is nothing advanced here , and all you will need is a basic knowledge of the layers palette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at all interested in the creation of these pieces , here you go . <p> Step 1 Start by creating a white circle in the middle of the canvas , and apply a radial gradient layer mask so the center is faded out . Drop the opacity down to 15% . <p> Step 2 Duplicate the circle layer we just made , and move it up and to the left . Bring the opacity up to 100% and set the layer Blending Mode to Overlay . <p> Step 3 Duplicate the layer we just made and drop the opacity down to 25% . Set the Blending Mode of this new layer to Color Dodge . Move the circle a bit to the right on the canvas . <p> Step 4 Duplicate the layer we just made , bring the opacity back up to 100% and set the Blending Mode to Soft Light . Shift the circle to the left a bit , and this time scale the circle down a little . <p> Step 5 Make a straight duplicate of the layer we just made , and shift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings the same . <p> Step 6 Now that we have all of our circles in place , it 's now time to add some shadows and highlights to bring a bit more definition to the shapes . Create a new layer , and set its Blending Mode to Overlay . Using the Brush Tool set to black , proceed to paint in a few soft shadows concentrating more on the lower-left portion of the sphere . Then on the same layer , set your brush to white and paint in a few highlights . Try to keep in mind where a light source might hit our sphere , and paint the shadows and highlights accordingly . I lassoed where I painted for the sake of clarity in the example image . <p> Step 7 To make the shading and highlights a bit more dramatic , duplicate the layer we just made and set its opacity to 50% . Keep the Blending Mode at Overlay . <p> Step 8 Now we need to make the highlights really pop . Create a new layer and set the Blending Mode to Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting , paint in a few focused highlight areas building on where you placed highlights in step 6 . <p> Step 9 Duplicate the layer we just made and set the Blending Mode to Overlay . <p> Step 10 Once again , duplicate the layer we just made and this time drop the opacity to 50% . <p> Step 11 Create a new Adjustment Layer and select Levels . When the levels dialogue box appears , set the white side to 145 and the dark side to 15 , and click Okay . Keep this new layer above all of the layers we have created so the level setting will be applied to all . <p> Step 12 Finally , we can now add some color to our sphere . Create a new layer , and remember to keep it below the Levels Adjustment Layer we just made . Using the Brush tool on a soft setting , paint in some color highlights on the sphere . Do this for a few colors to add some interest to the composition , in my case I chose red and purple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer to Overlay . You can continue to add some color on this layer until it feels right . <p> Step 14 After placing so many overlays on top of gradients you will notice some fragmentation or banding . To solve this , switch the canvas to 16-bit and everything will smooth out . Simply go to Image &gt; Mode &gt; 16-Bits/Channel . After saving your PSD as 16-bit , you can then flatten your canvas and switch back to 8-bit to save your work as a jpeg . <p> Step 15 Have some fun and try a few different color treatments using the Brush Tool or some gradients . Also shift the circle layers around a bit for more diversity . <p> I tried to keep this is simple and straight-forward as I could , so I hope this helps out those curious about my process . I do a great deal of adjusting and experimenting with my work , so be sure to try new things as you go to see how the slightest of alterations can change how color and overlays react with one another .

Move , move ! <p> Here it is , the finale for the Signalnoise Retro Poster Competition is upon us . When I posted this contest back in October I really was n't expecting such a huge reaction from artists and designers from all over the world . After clocking 131 entries in total , it was a very difficult and lengthy process of selecting the honorable mentions let alone the prize winner . A huge thanks to everyone who entered . The amount of time and effort you put forth is absolutely staggering . You should all be proud of yourselves . <p> So , without further yackin , the winners ! <h> First place winner <p> The first place winner is simply called Welcome ! by Erick Diaz . Selecting a winner out of such a diverse bunch of designs was incredibly difficult , as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pursued which is exactly what I was hoping for . But after many rounds of cuts , this poster really stood out for many reasons . Aside from really liking the color palette , the sheer number of elements displayed in this design are laid out in a very logical and clever fashion . I really like the Vegas props used , like the spades , dice , palm tress etc and the typography is diverse and fun harkening back to type-heavy travel and film posters from the 40s and 50s . I can easily see this hanging in an airport some 60 years ago . <p> A big congratulations to Erick Diaz for a job well done ! You will be receiving your Signalnoise prize pack soon . <h> Honorable mentions <p> And let 's not forget those who made the final cut . Here are the posters I thought were beautifully crafted in both style and content , and certainly deserved to get a featured spot in this competition . As I said , it was incredibly difficult to pick one out of so many excellent posters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the links to their portfolios . <p> A big thanks and congratulations to everyone who entered the first Signalnoise Retro Poster Competition , and to those who supported it and got the word out . The response blew me away and you can bet there will be another design-based competition in the near future as it is already in the works . Stay tuned for more ! <p> Well , its been a good month and a bit watching the submissions pour in for the Signalnoise Retro Poster Competition , and I 'm really happy to post them all right here . Please be warned , this post is the longest that has appeared on my blog , so you might need to give it a little bit to load , as there are 131 entries . The response has been incredible . <p> I kept the competition description simplistic for a very good reason . When I create my personal posters I start off with the idea of creating something referencing the past , and develop my idea from there . I wanted those interested in entering to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new pieces they can be proud of . As a result , just look at the diversity of the posters below . Their styles , content and palettes are all over the map which in my opinion , makes this competition a huge success .

@@121792081 @10792081/ <p> 1 year ago today , as I watched the flowing tributes to Steve Jobs on my Twitter stream , I designed a little Sad Mac icon for the blog . It was nothing big or profound , just a little tribute of my own for the man whose ideas , - philosophy- and- technology- has touched all our lives . A few days following I was contacted by NewsWeek magazine and my little icon was placed on the first page , opposite the table of contents in their Steve Jobs commemorative issue and was seen by hundreds of thousands . An unexpected journey for my little tribute . <p> So on the day we remember Steve , I 've put together some wallpapers available to download featuring my little Sad Mac . <p> Today is the day DRIVE is released on Blu-Ray in North America , and to celebrate one of the most talked-about movies of 2011 Signalnoise and Mystery Box has put together a little package of goodies available to download . <p> Since a lot of people will be grabbing the Blu-Ray today , included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRIVE Blu-Ray sleeve design all ready for print .

Add some hot pink to your favorite mobile device . Enjoy ! <p> I 've had a few requests to launch some wallpapers of the new Signalnoise identity , so here we go . I like my wallpaper to be clean , tidy , organized , tough and reliable . No crazy designs getting in the way of the folders on my desktop . I launched my previous logo as a wallpaper set about 2 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one into circulation . Here are the sizes . <p> A few weeks ago I was playing around with this vector graphic I made of an orb inside a hollowed cube , trying to make a geometric poster or use it as an element in a larger piece . I tried a few ideas then tossed it on the sidelines to chase another concept . This was originally going to be a part of the Year Zero design but I could n't quite make it fit . However , I liked design of the element and wanted to do something else with it . <p> This is the first time Ive done anything like this , but I want to make the little vector graphic available for you to use . I put together the above design using the cube to show what can be done with effects and stuff in Photoshop , and here are a few of the unsuccessful concepts I was playing with in Illustrator in an attempt to make the element look good . <p> So , Im interested to see what you can do . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are looking for a reason to make things . Simply download my vector file ( EPS ) right here and start playing with it in any form you please . Change the colors , add effects , pattern it , bust it apart , whatever you might have fun doing . The skys the limit . <p> Once you are done , feel free to post your creation in the Signalnoise Flickr pool . I 'd love to see what you come up with . Have fun ! <p> I 'm really excited to announce the release of my Signalnoise Source group of Photoshop and Illustrator files now available for purchase in the Signalnoise Store . This project was originally supposed to be available through the order of a DVD , but I wanted to cut out the production cost and wait time of orders . So , I shifted things to a download for more instant usability . <p> The purpose of my releasing these source files is simple , to show people how I work . I field many questions from designers via my broadcast , Twitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look inside the files and even play with the elements yourself . All of the layers , modes and effects are intact so you can really get a sense of how these images are built by exploring each element . And if you used any of these files to create something of your own , why not upload your creation to the newly formed Signalnoise Flickr group . <p> You can place an order for the Photoshop and Illustrator files over at the Signalnoise Store , each Photoshop file is 150dpi at 1200 x 1500 . Once you place the order you will be able to instantly download the corresponding ZIP file . You will be ready to open these files up and start experimenting and creating right away . <p> Now the stern bit . Because I would like to do more of these in the future , please treat these files with respect . By " respect " , I mean the following : <p> Do not use these files or any elements for commercial work . Do notresell any of these files or elements . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Do not print these files and sell them . <p> I cant stress it enough to abide by these simple rules . These files are made available to folks who would like a deeper understanding of Photoshop and Illustrator , how I arrange elements to achieve the effects I do , and for a launchpad for personal experimentation and visual exploration . In short , I want people to learn from these files and have fun using that knowledge to create , not use my hard work in hopes of making a buck . So , by purchasing and downloading these Photoshop and Illustrator files you are agreeing with these 4 points . Cool ? <p> So , swing on over to the Signalnoise Store and place an order as you normally would . But instead of receiving something in the mail , you will get an instant download . Hope you have lots of fun playing with the elements I 'm making available , and remember to post your creations to the newly formed Signalnoise Flickr group . Let 's get this giant collaboration going , kids . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legacy poster , adapted to the style and palette of the new trailers promoting the movie . With my first Tron Legacy poster I released a set of wallpapers with the same design , so here are the revised versions featuring the new design . Sorry it took me a little while to get these online , its surprising how long it takes to make different sizes of my crazy PSD files . Here are the links : <p> Please note that this design is fan-based and not official , just something I did for fun because I am enjoying the look of the upcoming Disney film . Feel free to download the proper size to add some neon action to your desktop or mobile device . Enjoy ! <p> I 'm pretty excited about this team-up with the mighty Abduzeedo for World Collabs #3 . I was asked by Aloa to take part in this segment and supply them with a fully layered PSD document for participants to download , remix and reinvent into their own unique creations . Collaborations are something I truly believe in , and what better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ? <p> I constructed the above image using elements from previous works , both used and unused . I did n't  make this an easy process with all my overlays and glows as I really want the participants to push themselves and beat these things into a creation of their own , much like my own process . : ) <p> Tip:Analyze the layers and effects , turn them on and off to see what they are doing . Create a new PSD document at the same size and resolution , then start sliding the layers into the new PSD one by one . This way you can see the individual elements at work instead of simply sliding them around . How can you change the idea and composition ? <p> Swing on over to to the post on Abduzeedo , The World Collabs #3 with James White to read the rules , grab the PSD and check out the submission details . I 'm really excited to see what people come up with using the elements I supplied . <p> If you are anything like me and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you probably just have one version saved in an AI document . You open it whenever needed and adapt it on the fly to whatever you might be using it for . I did the same thing for years . <p> However , with the new Signalnoise project I 'm working on I realized that was n't going to cut it . I will be needing to send my logo to other people for use across a few different mediums , on different colors , using a different colors , etc and I would be spending a lot of time asking these questions and creating the logo per task . That eats up a lot of time , so I spent a little while thinking about my identity and creating different versions for use in these situations , in the form of a basic identity AI document . <p> Some of you might have learned about Brand Standards Manuals in school , where you create a book of rules and regulations on how the logo will be used . You might not need to do it to that extent for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these alternate variations of your identity and create them in one document . Not only will it point out problems ( like color variations ) , but it will create a nice accessible library you can grab quickly or send to those who might need it . Think about things like : will you be printing on black or white ? Will your logo be 1-color or full color ? Will there be a wordmark or just an icon ? Its interesting stuff , and will certainly strengthen your personal identity .

The toys were cool , the cartoons were awesome , but the box art was the catalyst for daydreaming . Seeing that stuff on the shelves , looking at the hand-crafted portraits of the characters really got my mind going . The fact that these were actually painted , with all the textures and imperfections that come along with that process , really drove home a certain personality that is all but lost on kids today . <p> Excellent stuff .

It was that top image that caught my eye with the nice purples and oranges , but it was the other work that struck me really hard . Such wonderful use of colour , greyscale , geometry , natural forms , texture and effects . He obviously has the digital chops , but it all looks so natural . Not forced or over-designed . <p> Beautiful stuff . Stopped me in my tracks for a while . Check out Bens website for more of this work , and drop by the store to see what 's for sale , and say hello on Twitter . <p> I 've never spent too much time on a skateboard , aside from a few brief stints in the late 80s ( all of which ended in complete and total failure ) . Geography certainly played a role , as Western New York has never been confused with Southern California as a skateboarding hotbed , but at its peak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skateboard . I was a year or two behind the curve when it came to the " scene " , but the older kids relentlessly rocked those neon-colored boards up and down my street all summer long . <p> Recently , I watched- Stoked : The Rise and Fall of Gator , a documentary about the roller coaster life of former Vision frontman Mark " Gator " Rogowski. - His Vision Gator series was everywhere when I was a kid and almost everyone I knew had one of his signature boards with that distinct spiral pattern on it . Its amazing how someone can go from so high to so low in such a dramatic fashion , definitely worth watching if you 're at all interested in 80s subculture . <p> Watching Stoked got me reminiscing about those old board designs and I began scanning the web for imagery from back then , especially the Vision gear which I remember most clearly . Ads , decks , etc. , there was just so much that it actually defined skateboarding for a short period . <p> As Vision grew , they branched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing line . Predictably , once the company- became too mainstream and commercialized , the skateboard subculture rejected it . The backlash was quick and lethal to the Vision brand . Some kids were turned off by the corporate image and stopped skating altogether , others went underground , those who still wore Vision gear were simply cast off as sell-outs . Vision became a parody of itself . <p> Its a cautionary tale for independent brands whose audience has a distinct counterculture base : do n't  alienate your core audience , do n't  betray their loyalty and devotion , do n't  forget your roots . It seems like simple formula , but the corporate landscape is littered with these kinds of examples . <p> Vision still exists to this day , but as a mere ghost of its former identity . Just like the once great " Gator " himself , Visions heydays have passed them by , the height of their success forever shackled to the decade that originally made them . <p> I came across these lovely wine country travel posters a little while back and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hatch in San Fran , I really know nothing else about them . They were for sale at some point through SFMOMA , but I could n't find a trace in their store . Even had a hard time finding larger versions online , so please pardon the smaller scale . <p> So here 's the thing . I 'm a Canadian boy and , growing up back in the 80s and 90s I was a die hard Toronto Blue Jays fan . From the classic line-up of Bell , Gruber and Moseby right up until they won back-to-back World Series in 92 and 93 , I was cheering for my Jays . And you know what a big part of that was ? The logo which theyve used since 77 . <p> But in the late 90s it seemed the norm to " re-brand " sports teams like nuts . It drove me crazy because so many of the classic logos were perfectly sound without need of a re-design AND all sports team logos started looking the same . Some kind of angry animal or whatever busting through a wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketing people would say " looks cool " . Screw you . <p> My Jays were no different . In 97 they revised the classic logo which made the Jay look over-weight , like he ate too many of them ballpark franks after the World Series wins . Then in 2003 geez , I have no idea . A blue jay getting friendly with the Texas Rangers ? A maple leaf tattoo on his " bicep " ? Ugh . <p> And then in 2004 , full-on generic angry blue jay logo complete with the beveled " Jays " hunk o turd . Zero reference to 27 years of the clubs history . Looks like every other logo across 3 sports in North America . Being a longtime fan and a designer , this was a- disappointing- reveal when it happened . <p> In all honesty , I lost track of my Jays in 2004 mostly because the identity of the team , to me , was totally stripped . The team I had loved was gone and replaced by well , these guys . Yes , I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was NOTHING familiar to me anymore . They even had black uniforms . Black uniforms on a team with BLUE in the name . <p> Why am I going on this tangent ? To offer a nice contrast to what happened last week . The Toronto Blue Jays unveiled their new logo and uniforms and when I clicked the link to see , 7-year-old James cheered his ass off . After 14 years of seeing that other team playing the part of my Blue Jays , I was thrilled to see my guys come back . Kind of teared up , I 'm sure you can see why . <p> Theres going to be people whining about the new type , or line thickness , or colours , or that face that they think the Blue Jays suck , but I do n't  care . Keep it to yourself . <p> To whomever was in charge of pulling off the Blue Jays new identity , a huge high-five on this one . You brought them right back to when every kid in Canada was a Jays fan . Simplicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tinker Toys package redesign by Kelly Abeln . I like seeing re-imaginings of classic toys and games just to see how the brand could possibly be taken in different directions . But this one really hit home . Kellys design is fresh , fun and functional with the little diagrams of pieces . <p> But best of all , the design was obviously treated with respect to the product . No flashy light beams or attempts to " hip up " a classic toy ( which seems to be the norm these days ) . Just a nice , strong design . A proud design . These are Tinker Toys , not Dora or Pokemon , or whatever kids are into . This toy is older than all of us , and its proud of that . Kellys redesign speaks on that level . <p> I posted the original Tinker Toys can here as well , which I believe is the one I had as a kid . I love the comparison of the old to Kellys . Certain harmony there . I dig it . <p> PS . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 5 . Had to get dad to open it all the time . <p> Some beautiful branding work for the Classic Film Union by South Yall . From what I gather from this post , these bits were developed for a kind of online collection system for film fans . Not sure about the ins and outs , but this is some great work . Those badges are fantastic . <p> Here is an awesome spread of work by Londons own Tom Hodge , also known as The Dude Designs . I first saw Toms work when his official poster for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN emerged about a year ago and have been frequenting his site ever since to see what he s been up to . My favorite of his might be that- DEAR GOD NO ! - poster above . His work is fantastic and crazy , really dives into- independent- VHS cover art from the 80s back when covers and posters meant something . <p> But , were living in an interesting time right now . With the rise of artists like Tom , Olly Moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the platform Mondo has built , we are seeing more attention being brought back to the art of the movie poster which has for too long been ruled by Photoshopped floating heads . This makes me happy . Real happy .

We all had dinner , got to try his new wine , hear some hilarious stories , and got some shots of him holding THE THING poster I designed . Said he loved it . <p> With tomorrows release of Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon , I 'm proud to unleash my latest art for Dean and all my pals at UbiSoft . Since we focused on- protagonist- Rex Colt for the previous art , we all wanted to do something with the bad guys . And who better than the Omega Force ? <p> I 'm extremely proud to show the work Ive been doing for UbiSoft in support of their upcoming release , FAR CRY 3 : BLOOD DRAGON . Me and the team at UbiSoft have been carving this stuff out for the past 8 months or so and having a great time the entire way . The game is super 80s movie inspired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as you can imagine I was ALL OVER this thing . As the materials were linked online over the past month , a few keen-eyed nerds spotted a potential Signalnoise influence , well I can finally say that you were right . <p> We started off by designing the main logo for the game , seen above on the posters . Chrome letters and pink paint , we knew what we wanted right off the bat so I got to it . The posters were the biggest deal , and had me doing sketches and comps as we figured out where things would land to compliment the game aesthetic and all the awesome crap we loved as kids . When you have a client writing back saying stuff like " MORE FUCKING LIGHTNING ! " , you know you fell in with a great crowd . I pulled out the Struzan-inspired techniques and got to it . <p> I should also point out , that 's one of my favorite action stars in there , Michael Biehn . You 'll remember him from TERMINATOR , ALIENS and THE ABYSS . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use his likeness in this piece . I was shaking as I built that poster . <p> That video was created by the team at UbiSoft and wow , it just blew my face clean off . 80s animation , VCR tracking , so good . I did n't  have anything to with the trailer and I saw it for the first time when it was launched yesterday . I just needed to include it here out of pure love . The best game ad Ive ever seen . So proud of my pals at UbiSoft . <p> There will be more to come as UbiSoft and I plot more goodies for FAR CRY 3 : BLOOD DRAGON ( which launches May 1 , I believe ) . A giant shout-out to my pals Jason Eisener for linking me to this amazing project , and to my new partner in 80s crime , Dean Evans for keeping me laughing and inspired the entire time . <p> Here is my Green Lantern power battery illustration as an animated GIF to display the importance of texture and lighting . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build my base shapes in Illustrator first before moving into Photoshop . Illustrator allows me to get really precise with the shapes and colour , making sure those bezier points are working for me . But the texture and lighting work in Photoshop is what really brings these otherwise flat illustrations to life . <p> The first frame of the GIF is my flat vectors ( and a bit of brush masking ) , and the second is with all the effects turned on . <p> I cant talk about any project details ( game industry NDA stuff ) , but I 'll just leave this right here . <p> EDIT : Yep , this was an April Fools gag that I put together this weekend . Most of you got wise to it pretty early . To those who thought it might be the real deal , whoops ! My apologies to Bill Watterson who probably never saw this thing anyway . But hey , got ta be polite . <p> Deadlines have been packed throughout the last 2 weeks so my illustration output has slowed a bit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , its a mixed bag . The Hubble Space Telescope , The Bride from KILL BILL and my main man RoboCop . <p> That grumpy looking lumberjack was created for my pal Jerko . We were having a few cold ones the other night and he told me about this story he was working on , hinging on something from an old horror magazine . Jerko loves his horror . I cracked out the sketchbook and we worked up a doodle . That 's my take on the main character , WeirdBeard . <p> Things have been moving on the illustration front , and my output ended up landing me a really cool client gig . Banged out 3 illustrations for none other than the Canon camera company last week . Once I get the- green light- I 'll post them up . Super fun . <p> Big thanks to my pal Andy Cotnam for the helpful advice on the RoboCop ! <p> If you 've been following my work over the past year , you may have come across several posters that I designed for my favorite movies . I created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE , INDIANA JONES , TERMINATOR 2 and some others , all of which can be found in my portfolio . I made it my mission to break into the alternative art movie poster industry , but unfortunately only 2 posters were officially printed and offered for sale . The others remained in legal limbo , personal development , self-initiated projects whatever you want to call it . <p> Aside from what was released online I did a lot of work behind the scenes developing ideas and visuals for many of my favorite movies . I never had permission , I designed them merely for my own enjoyment and practise . Most are thumbnails in my sketchbook while others I pushed to a digital sketch . Seen above are 5 posters that never got out of the concept phase . Very few people have seen these up until now . The Signalnoise movie posters that werent . <p> Before I build my posters in final vector format , I mock things up in Photoshop to experiment with the composition , colours and texture . Normally I cobble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " paint " the entire poster from scratch . Ideas tend to shift and change as I go , which is why you 'll see differences between the ink sketches and the digital mock-ups above . <p> These concepts have been sitting on my computer for months , figured I 'd post them . And the thing is , this is n't all of them so you might see a Part II to this post in the future . <p> Ive been creating illustrations in this style for about a month now , a kind of ongoing experiment of forcing myself into a new process . I was hanging out with some friends last week and one of the bits of feedback I got on the new work was " create some original material " . As in , not something attached to a franchise . Good point there , so I got at it . <p> here 's an illustration titled The Arrival , depicting an adventuring kid out in the woods who witnesses a big meteor falling to earth . Simple little idea . Maybe the start of a story ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking what software I 'm using to make these things , so seen above are 3 versions of the illustration . The original concept from my sketchbook , the straight vectors in Illustrator , then my final in Photoshop . Should give you a rough idea of how I build up the illustrations .

I was very interested to see how he tackles creating his unique art , and I 'm sure other readers are in the same boat . I was thrilled that he agreed . <p> Check it out as Alex dissects the tools he uses , the planning and process he goes through to conceptualize his works , some in progress shots and discusses some hilarious bits along the way . <p> A huge thanks to Alex for letting us all get a glimpse behind him and his excellent work . I 'm very excited to announce the first Signalnoise Exclusive starring Alex Varanese . Enjoy ! <p> . . . . . . . . . . <p> For me , producing a piece of art is a lot like child birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but because Im hopped up on drugs so powerful that they have to be injected directly into my spinal column . I 'm kidding , of course . Everyone knows that winners do n't  use drugs . Winners do use a variety of tools , however , and I 'd like to talk a little about the ones I use to create my work . Specifically , I 'll be dissecting the very first piece I created in my current collection ; its called " February 06 " ( which is strange , since it was made in September of 2008 ) and its the first entry in a 6-part series called Circuit Bent Type : <p> Let 's start with the basics : I come from a 3D illustration background , so I tend to think in terms of objects and places rather than photographs or 2D shapes . I had a few goals for the Circuit Bent Type series , and I wanted to make sure the first piece hit them all : <p> A heavy emphasis on retro audio gear and hobbyist electronics ( hence " circuit bending " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincingly like an actual arrangement of real objects . <p> The incorporation of both 2D and 3D typographical elements . <p> No use whatsoever of commercial typefaces , down to the model numbers on the chips and the signature in the corner . All text is either hand-drawn lettering or a custom-made font . <p> As is the case with a lot of my ideas , the general layout came to me all at once . I knew I wanted the term " LO-FI " to play a central role , and I had vague images in my head of some kind of homemade cassette-playing apparatus . I immediately committed the ideas to paper to make sure I would n't forget anything : <p> If you 've seen the rest of the Circuit Bent Type series , you 'll recognize early versions of other pieces mixed in here as well . As you can see , these borderline scribbles are n't  meant to impress ; I generally sketch as fast as I possibly can to keep up with the flow of ideas out of fear that I 'll miss something . Then , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath , notice that my million dollar idea did n't  abruptly vanish after all , and wonder what all the fuss was about . <p> You 'll notice that quite an evolution took place between this initial idea and the finished piece . My sketches are always more of a loose outline than a blueprint . The following screenshots are taken from 3ds max , my full-time renderer and part-time lover , and give an idea of what the modeling process was like : <p> I tend to model and texture in separate phases , so my first goal was simply establishing the geometry of the scene . The following " clay render " is what the piece looks like without any materials applied : <p> With the modeling complete , I began the soul-crushing , thanklessly laborious task of unwrapping the texture coordinates of each mesh and painting textures to wrap back over them . In total , this scene required 44 separate maps , most ranging from 384+384 to 2048+2048 . here 's a little collage of a few of them : <p> The party then moved to Illustrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final composition . I used an ultra abstract typeface I 'd recently designed called Edgewise to spell out an appropriately cryptic phrase from one of the real audio cassettes I used as a modeling reference : " SUPER PRECISION ANTI-RESONANCE / CASSETTE MECHANISM HIGH BIAS EQ " . It was either that or " PAPA DO NT PREACH / IM IN TROUBLE DEEP " . The combination of a meaningless message and nearly illegible lettering allowed for a text element that would fill the space in a visually interesting way but would n't demand specific attention from the viewer . <p> I was then ready to start stirring it all together in Photoshop : <p> These are the three basic layers of the piece : the original render from 3ds max , the typographical lockup from Illustrator , and a grimey background I painted using grunge brushes I 'd created from some texture photos I took around town . To really drive home the retro feel , I finished up by overlaying some noise and about a bajillion adjustment layers to tweak the color balance , saturation , levels and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmodified image , all drab and vanilla , while the upper half is straight up old school playa-hatin funk . The combination of a 3D render as the base imagery , vector and typographical elements on top , a grungy texture layer on the bottom and a heavy dose of hyperstylized post-processing to tie it all together worked well and set the pattern for most of the work Ive done to date . here 's the final piece again , as well a number of full-res closeups taken from the original 36+16 ? , 300dpi PSD file : <p> In summary , my approach to the creative process requires three fundamental elements : rendered imagery , thoughtful typography and fabulous hair . In practice I rarely achieve more than two of these at any given time , but its the constant struggle for the trifecta that keeps me on my toes . <p> You sound like an after school special , mashed together with crazy talent and a concentrated dose of pure awesome ( for medicinal use , of course ) . Well done . <p> This is wicked cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation . I cant help but grin when you talk about your work this way . <p> I 'm curious if there 's a particular reason that you 've used " February 06 ? in this piece . Is it a random date , or it there some mind bogglingly brilliant meaning behind it ? Do I need security clearance to hear the secret ?

@@121792106 @10792106/ <h> Signalnoise Tutorial : Rainbow Shards <p> As some of you know , I spoke at FITC Toronto last month where I included a small and simple Photoshop tutorial on how I achieved the rainbow shard effect seen in many of my poster designs over the last few years . What I showed to the crowd was a stripped down version so I could demonstrate easily and quickly how the effect was created in about 4 minutes . We cant have only those who attended have all the fun , so here is the web version of the tutorial in the exact way I presented it at the conference . <p> But before we begin , please PLEASE try experimenting with various steps along the way . I understand tutorials are meant to be a map from point A to point B where you can create the exact results shown , but screw that . Try your own stuff , add images , change the shapes , switch up the colors . Anyone can read and follow instructions , its the exploration and playing that makes it your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , not replicating . <p> Bear that in mind , and let 's get to it . <p> Step 1 : In Adobe Illustrator , create some basic shapes using a few varying degrees of greys . Try to get a good range so they do n't  look so monotone . If you are looking to get things lining up later on , be sure to hold down the Shift key while making these so all lines are perfectly horizontal , vertical or 45- . <p> Experiment tip ! After you 've run through this tutorial once , try creating some other shapes to play with later on . Its super fun , trust me . <p> Step 2 : I originally used Flash in order to create these random little groups , but you really do n't  have to . Take the shapes you created in Step 1 and make a few groups with a variety of size and dispersal . Take a bit of time here to play with the shapes and get the groups looking as random and interesting as possible . If you are adjusting lengths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 45- angle so things line up properly . <p> Experiment tip ! Seriously , do n't  cut corners here because it will hurt you later . The more interesting the groups are here will improve depth later . Try using different shapes and arrangements to see what results they might yield . Think of these groups as your tools , the better they are the better they will work for you . <p> Step 3 : Copy and paste 2 of the groups you just created into Photoshop onto a black canvas , then drop the opacity of these layers down to 50% each . Expand the size of the shapes a bit so they bleed off . You can set the dimensions of the canvas to whatever you like , I just chose this format because my it was for my Keynote presentation . <p> Step 4 : Copy and paste 2 more groups of shapes into Photoshop on top of the previous ones from Step 3 . Again , expand the groups so they bleed off the edges of the canvas . <p> Step 5 : Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Overlay . You should now be able to see some interesting things happening as the shapes react to those underneath . <p> Experiment tip ! Try adding as many layers as you wish to this step . Also try adjusting the scale and opacity of the shapes to see what happens . <p> Step 6 : Now its time to add color . Create a new layer , select a full spectrum linear gradient and apply it across the canvas . I then selected the shapes below in order to apply a layer mask to the color layer . Looks pretty gross , huh ? <p> Experiment tip ! Try using different colors , radial gradients or using the airbrush tool to create custom color fills . <p> Step 7 : Set the Blending Mode of the color layer to Overlay , and set the opacity to around 35% . This coloring does n't  look too interesting but there is a method of applying color I discovered quite by accident , which is by way of layering colors over top of one another <p> Step 8 : Duplicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . This will improve the saturation of your colors without over-blowing or pixelating the shapes . You might have to adjust the opacities of your color layers individually of they are reacting too harshly with one another . I included my layers palette in this image to show you how I have things set up so far . <p> Here is the clean version of Step 8 . <p> Step 9 : Now we are going to add some subtle highlights and shading to the shapes in order to create a bit more dimension . Create a new layer and set the Blending Mode to Overlay . Select the gradient tool with a setting of white to transparent , and apply a radial gradient to the upper-right corner . Do the same steps and apply a black radial gradient to the lower-left corner . You can adjust the opacity of this overlay if the highlight or shadow are too harsh . <p> Experiment tip ! Try using this method of highlight and shadow in different areas to either bring elements forward or knock parts back . It can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there you go , nothing to it . <p> This is a fairly simple tutorial , but I hope you can understand the possibility of experimentation particularly in the early steps . Its nothing to just follow instructions to yield to same outcome , the real power comes from playing with elements along the way to see what results might come about . <p> So have fun , and feel free to post your creations in the comments . I 'd love to see what you come up with . <h> 29 Comments <p> Thank you so much ! This is a great tutorial ! Thank you so much for sharing.I was gon na suggest opening a special category on blog called submissions where you would review and make comments on other peoples work.If you have the time of course ! Here is something I did couple of weeks ago , heavily inspired by your work . <p> Gavin , I would n't recommend manipulating your shapes in Photoshop because you would need to rastorize the SmartObjects which takes scalability away from you . Its best to keep most of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it non-destructive . <p> Ah great tutorial . A while back when you posted a teaser for your tutorial DVD with the . psd file I went to work trying to create my own shards to experiment with . I want to try the coloring and layer styles that I saw in the . psd . <p> Thanks for the tip , James . I cant agree with you more about experimenting . Tutorials are just a guide to help you experiment .. and when such an advice comes from a person as established as you , I cant wait to put my ideas to work ..

Thats reason #1 , keep rockin Matt ! <p> Here are a few preview images of the upcoming Signalnoise t-shirt releases , dropping in August . The response to the launch of the t-shirt line has been nothing less then overwhelming so I immediately started on the designs for the next installment . A couple of these designs call back to my childhood which was full of cartoons and playing with Lego on my bedroom floor . I enjoy creating things that are funny , interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure . <p> I will be working on moving these designs ( and perhaps one other ) into production over the next week or so once the designs and numbers are finalized , and they will be available in the Signalnoise Store after the full shipment is received . Stay tuned for these ones , kids . <p> That being said , I am working hard to fulfill the many orders I received over the past 2 weeks . I never expected to have so many orders to send so quickly , which is a good problem to have . : ) However , all orders are being taken care of as quickly as possible and I appreciate your patience as I get your wares to you . <p> Thanks so much for the continued support , everyone ! You really turned this new Signalnoise venture into a super fun ordeal . <p> As with a lot of people , I was pretty pumped to see the new Tron Legacy trailer from the San Diego Comic Con hit the web last week , revealing more of the story , characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched it a bunch just to eat up the overall design . <p> A year ago when the initial footage for Tron Legacy was released I set about creating my own poster for the film , being a huge fan of the direction and style . My poster flew all over the web , and was even mistaken by Netflix as being the official release which gave me a pretty good laugh . But , the design and palette of the film underwent a bit of a change since that initial footage was released , resulting in my poster being a touch obsolete . Still being pumped for the movie , I cracked open my old Photoshop file and began revising my original design to reflect the new direction . <p> This was a really fun exercise , where I had to revise all of the important elements including the disc design , neon color treatments and lighting effects . I wanted the new version to reflect some of the style updates including the grey-blue architecture design and brilliant amber lighting seen on the characters wardrobe and vehicles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the updated version : <p> The designs are n't  100% accurate to the concept design of the film or anything , I just wanted to make this poster interesting and fun . At the time , I presumed the official poster once released would showcase the main actor or something , so I wanted to do the opposite and focus on the film content and style . I treated the revision as if Disney needed the update based on what has been happening during production . As much as I would like to design something for Tron Legacy , this poster design is not official by any means . Just a personal project for the fun of it . <p> I will be sending this poster to the print shop super soon and will figure out some methods of getting this into peoples hands , along with updating all of the Tron Legacy wallpapers I had previously released . Stay tuned ! <p> Happy Friday , everyone ! I 'm currently on a small trip outside the city to do some relaxing and was n't planning on getting back to the blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty excited about this new trailer for Tron Legacy released at the San Diego Comic Con .

These are Tinker Toys , not Dora or Pokemon , or whatever kids are into . This toy is older than all of us , and its proud of that .

They showed all the important and influential films from the scene complete with footage and a lot of posters . <p> A big part of the film was the Blaxploitation sub-genre that erupted in the 1970s . Ive been a big fan of these films for quite some time , primarily for their over the top dialogue , action scenes and plot lines . But it was pretty clear while watching American Grindhouse that Blaxploitation films had the best , and most badass posters by far . I decided to round up some of my favorites . Typically showcasing the stars and scenes on a white background , each poster has their own unique characteristics . I simply love the arrangements and killer title treatments , just look at that Super Fly T.N.T . poster . Lighting his smoke with lit dynamite ? !

After doing some research on sci-fi publications from the 70s and 80s I took some heavy inspiration from Omni magazine covers .

At this moment in 1999 I was in Montreal visiting my friend Lisa and geared up for the big Y2K meltdown . I was listening to a lot of Rob Zombie and Radiohead , still flipping out over Fight Club and working my way as a fledgling designer through the web boom . I visited K10k and Designiskinky everyday , watched what new Flash experiments Joshua Davis was up to , all the while struggling to make a cool website for this Signalnoise thing I had going .

Tuts+ Commemorative 2010 Poster I was asked by the kind folks over at the Tuts+ Network to design an original poster and wallpaper for their big holiday giveaway that has been happening over the last 11 days . Well , tomorrow is the 12th and final day when they will be announcing and showing off the new Signalnoise poster I created for them . They will be giving away 10 copies so be sure to check it out tomorrow morning . <p> 2 .

The other two images shown here are part of a series I had not seen before . Beautiful palettes and nice mixture of photo and vector elements . Really enjoy how soft these images feel . 
@@121792112 @10792112/ <h> Inspiration : M.C. Eschers patterns <p> M.C. Escher is probably most known for his impossible architecture and landscape drawings , showcasing his play on perspective and point of view to create structures which ultimately can not exist . <p> As beautifully crafted as these images are , I have always been more captivated by Eschers pattern works . His ability to create a fluid and seamless plane of repeated images fitting perfectly togather is both unrivaled and mind-boggling . I bought a thick book years ago which breaks down and analyzes the mathematical formulas behind his patterns , which I proceeded to start reading countless times . To this day , his work still makes little sense to me : ) <p> Definitely an inspiration . I bought a print of Metamorphose at the Escher museum in The Hague , which is a 15 or so foot long by 9 ? tall print . Posted it along my stairwell so when I go up and down the stairs , I can follow the transition of patterns and impossible architecture <p> Thanks for this , James . Its nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its so easy to just get caught up in what 's ahead in design , and staying up to date on the latest trends .

What 's the name of the " thick book " you mentioned ? <p> A personal favourite of mine is the one where the lizards in the pattern crawl out , become " three-dimensional " , breahte steam , and then return to the pattern .

I was familiar with a few Glaser works , namely his poster featuring Bob Dylan , and his I Love NY logo . <p> The film is incredible , showing many pieces of Glasers pieces and footage of his studio while he talks about the role of artists and designers in the world . Not only is Glaser skilled at his craft , but exceptional at breaking down the core reasons why us artists do what we do , and what the work means to the world .

@@121792114 @10792114/ <p> Here is another LOST treat for all you like-minded fans out there . These amazing caricatures were created by famed comic book illustrator J. Scott Campbell . <p> Its great to see Campbell blowing out such nice sketches for my favorite show because I was a fan of his from waaaay back when he cut his teeth with Wildstorm Comics , laying down his bouncy pencils for Gen13 in the early 90s . I always enjoyed his playful style and he draws some hilariously sexy cartoon ladies , as seen in his Danger Girl series . <p> But just look at the incredible likenesses he captures in these drawings . I mean , check Sayid ! You can not get any closer then that , perfect expression . My pal Dave described Campbell as being " the new Mort Drucker " , and that 's a pretty accurate thought . I 'd love to see Campbell do more caricature work , man he s good at it . <p> Check out the wonderful illustration skill of European artist Martine Johanna . Amazing precision with hand drawn elements , specifically faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and characters worked into every piece . <p> My pal Skratch Bastid put on a hell of a spectacle at the Signalnoise art show on April 25th at Resistor Gallery in Toronto . Not only did he play a solid line-up of great tunes , but he started ripping up the tables near the end of the evening . Check out this video shot and edited by Aaron Van Domelen . Great job catching the vibe of Skratchs performance , and some really nice shots in there . <p> Big thanks to Aaron for sending this over , and always mad highfives to the Bastid for killin it . <p> Here is a post I think is a bit overdue on my part . I really dove into comics back in the mid to late 90s , and to this day tend to re-read the graphic novels that reside on my shelf from that time period . Sandman , Sin City , Madman , Astro City , there was some really great stuff that came out back then . Amongst them was my favorite , Hellboy . <p> Now let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies which I thought were alright , but the Hellboy Im referring to was the comic book version . Let 's get old school . <p> Mike Mignola is the man , and the reason I think he stands alone in the world of comic books is because of his design sensibility . For those who are familiar with his work , you know his unique system of pacing . Mignola is n't concerned with loading each panel and page with as much crap as he can , he does the opposite by including a full page with no dialogue , showing Hellboy walking through a forest with panels dedicated to showing flowers or a solitary bird sitting on a branch . <p> Another lovely design choice is his use of color , or more specifically , Dave Stewarts use of color . His backgrounds and other characters tend to have a desaturated palette while Hellboy , and Hellboy alone , has a pure vibrant red . This sets his character apart on the page and makes him special . Excellent design choice . <p> Finally , Mikes cover design capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun whenever we see a new Hellboy cover " Oh , there 's Hellboy standing in a plume of smoke again with heads and skulls behind him ! " but its always kind-hearted . Mignola takes great care in constructing the elements of his covers , pulling cues from the story and arranging them with interest and atmosphere . Beautiful stuff . <p> If you are familiar with Hellboy , keep rockin . If not , might I suggest checking out the short story entitled " The Corpse " for a wonderful example of Mignolas art and pacing . <p> For everyone who missed the last broadcast , here is the recorded version of Signalnoise Broadcast 6 for you to check out . As always , it was a great turn-out with a bunch of wonderful questions . We discussed lots of design stuff , processes , some technical things and lots of other topics . <p> Thanks again to everyone who tunes into the broadcasts . You truly make these things enjoyable to do . <p> PS . Sorry about the long silence at the beginning . Ustream froze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " moment .

It was a great time preparing all of the little things that come along with such an endeavor , and I 'm happy to say I hit no snags along the way . The folks at Resistor , namely Kim and Ron were excellent to deal with and I owe them both a huge thanks for making this such a great experience . <p> In order to make my posters a bit different for this unique occasion , I decided to get the designs printed to canvas . They were printed in Toronto and shipped directly to the gallery , so I did n't  actually see them until I arrived and set about hanging them . A rather reckless method of going about this thing , but I was ecstatic when I saw the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas and the texture breathed new life into my work , not at all what I was expecting . <p> The doors opened at 7pm and I was very happy to see a constantly changing crowd as the night went on .

All in all , a wonderful evening which found me quite overwhelmed with support . Thanks so much to everyone who made the time to come by , it is greatly appreciated ! <p> I would like to pass on a big thank-you to Nick Campbell , the Grey Scale Gorilla . Nick was nice enough to create the excellent retro Signalnoise logo animation which looped on the television screens all evening , it looked like something out of the 70s . You rock , Nick ! Check it out : <p> Another massive thank-you to the ever-talented Skratch Bastid for providing the killer jams throughout the evening .

Nobody can stop you , Skratch ! <p> Last but not least , big thanks to my pal Chris Toms for snapping a tonne of photos throughout the evening , some of which you will see in this post . Thanks Chris ! <p> If you missed the opening reception , my work will remain on display until May 25th at Resistor Gallery , 284 College Street in Toronto . <p> In an effort to have these things more frequently , I will be holding Signalnoise Broadcast 6 this coming Wednesday afternoon , May 5th at 2pm EST .

@@121792118 @10792118/ <h> Signalnoise Tutorial : Rainbow Shards <p> As some of you know , I spoke at FITC Toronto last month where I included a small and simple Photoshop tutorial on how I achieved the rainbow shard effect seen in many of my poster designs over the last few years . What I showed to the crowd was a stripped down version so I could demonstrate easily and quickly how the effect was created in about 4 minutes . We cant have only those who attended have all the fun , so here is the web version of the tutorial in the exact way I presented it at the conference . <p> But before we begin , please PLEASE try experimenting with various steps along the way . I understand tutorials are meant to be a map from point A to point B where you can create the exact results shown , but screw that . Try your own stuff , add images , change the shapes , switch up the colors . Anyone can read and follow instructions , its the exploration and playing that makes it your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , not replicating . <p> Bear that in mind , and let 's get to it . <p> Step 1 : In Adobe Illustrator , create some basic shapes using a few varying degrees of greys . Try to get a good range so they do n't  look so monotone . If you are looking to get things lining up later on , be sure to hold down the Shift key while making these so all lines are perfectly horizontal , vertical or 45- . <p> Experiment tip ! After you 've run through this tutorial once , try creating some other shapes to play with later on . Its super fun , trust me . <p> Step 2 : I originally used Flash in order to create these random little groups , but you really do n't  have to . Take the shapes you created in Step 1 and make a few groups with a variety of size and dispersal . Take a bit of time here to play with the shapes and get the groups looking as random and interesting as possible . If you are adjusting lengths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 45- angle so things line up properly . <p> Experiment tip ! Seriously , do n't  cut corners here because it will hurt you later . The more interesting the groups are here will improve depth later . Try using different shapes and arrangements to see what results they might yield . Think of these groups as your tools , the better they are the better they will work for you . <p> Step 3 : Copy and paste 2 of the groups you just created into Photoshop onto a black canvas , then drop the opacity of these layers down to 50% each . Expand the size of the shapes a bit so they bleed off . You can set the dimensions of the canvas to whatever you like , I just chose this format because my it was for my Keynote presentation . <p> Step 4 : Copy and paste 2 more groups of shapes into Photoshop on top of the previous ones from Step 3 . Again , expand the groups so they bleed off the edges of the canvas . <p> Step 5 : Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Overlay . You should now be able to see some interesting things happening as the shapes react to those underneath . <p> Experiment tip ! Try adding as many layers as you wish to this step . Also try adjusting the scale and opacity of the shapes to see what happens . <p> Step 6 : Now its time to add color . Create a new layer , select a full spectrum linear gradient and apply it across the canvas . I then selected the shapes below in order to apply a layer mask to the color layer . Looks pretty gross , huh ? <p> Experiment tip ! Try using different colors , radial gradients or using the airbrush tool to create custom color fills . <p> Step 7 : Set the Blending Mode of the color layer to Overlay , and set the opacity to around 35% . This coloring does n't  look too interesting but there is a method of applying color I discovered quite by accident , which is by way of layering colors over top of one another <p> Step 8 : Duplicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . This will improve the saturation of your colors without over-blowing or pixelating the shapes . You might have to adjust the opacities of your color layers individually of they are reacting too harshly with one another . I included my layers palette in this image to show you how I have things set up so far . <p> Here is the clean version of Step 8 . <p> Step 9 : Now we are going to add some subtle highlights and shading to the shapes in order to create a bit more dimension . Create a new layer and set the Blending Mode to Overlay . Select the gradient tool with a setting of white to transparent , and apply a radial gradient to the upper-right corner . Do the same steps and apply a black radial gradient to the lower-left corner . You can adjust the opacity of this overlay if the highlight or shadow are too harsh . <p> Experiment tip ! Try using this method of highlight and shadow in different areas to either bring elements forward or knock parts back . It can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there you go , nothing to it . <p> This is a fairly simple tutorial , but I hope you can understand the possibility of experimentation particularly in the early steps . Its nothing to just follow instructions to yield to same outcome , the real power comes from playing with elements along the way to see what results might come about . <p> So have fun , and feel free to post your creations in the comments . I 'd love to see what you come up with . <h> 29 Comments <p> Thank you so much ! This is a great tutorial !

@@121792125 @10792125/ <h> The art of Dave McKean <p> I 'm going to dive pretty far back into my progression as an artist and talk about a guy who had a huge influence on me and my work at an important time . Dave McKean was introduced to me way back in 1993 or something by way of his Sandman comic book covers . <p> I was instantly made crazy by his work , mostly because I did n't  really know what I was looking at . His work introduced me to the idea of " mixed media " , he was so multi-faceted as an artist that he used an array of mediums to create his pieces and designs . Paint , ink , sculpture , typography , photography , construction , he really did it all and used certain disciplines to achieve certain goals . Very early on I picked up Dust Covers , Arkham Asylum and Signal to Noise and proceeded to visually dissect them , trying to figure out how he did what he did . <p> In all honesty , back in 1995 Dave McKean played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do what he did . <p> So in 95 I enrolled and was accepted into Graphic Design in my hometown of Truro where I was introduced to Photoshop , a tool that definitely answered a few questions regarding McKeans creative execution . I started experimenting almost immediately with photography , drawing and other mediums to see how I could blend them together the way he did . Here is a few pieces of my older work created between 1998 2003 : <p> As you can see , McKeans influence stuck with me for over a decade and his work really pushed me to now only study how Photoshop worked but how other mediums work as well . Being an aspiring artist and designer at the time , I could n't have asked for a better kick in the ass . I looked at his work daily for years and still flip through his many books Ive acquired . <p> It kind of makes me weepy looking back at McKeans work from the 90s , I spent so many hours flipping through his material back then . I remember sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkham Asylum , and flipping the page to see that insane Joker image above . Just about melted my face off . <p> Always remember who influenced you at important times in your life . Those are the turning points , man . <h> 10 Comments <p> I first saw McKeans work on the Cover of Burn my eyes from Machine Head . Then started discovering all other covers he had worked on for great bands , like Testament , Fear Factory just to name a few . You can see more here . He was a great inspiration for me also . Great post . <p> Nice one James , Dave McKean is a huge influence in my personal work and I am stoked you are exposing your fans to such a comic master . What do you think of the similarity between McKean and Bill Sienkiewiczs work ? I think it might be the influence of Barron Storey , but what do you think ? <p> Thanks a lot for the comments , gang . For a really long time I was the only person I knew who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . So great to see others who were influenced by his work and ambition . <p> Right there with you , James . I arrived at McKean after some warming up with Bill Sienkiewicz . For the years I was actively doing a lot of freelance illustration ( mid-late 90s ) Daves influence was heavy on me indeed . I had the good fortune to meet him on a few occasions ( mostly at Comic-con ) and was even lucky enough to purchase a page of original art from Mr. Punch !

The topmost image was released a few months back with the launch of Brass Tack by Joshua Smith , but did n't  take note of who created it at the time . <p> I really enjoy modern illustrators who use new software to create imagery and ideas that are similar to old school metal , like White Zombie for example . Everything Jeremy creates would look smashing on a t-shirt , whether its as serious as a shark eating a skeleton or as hilarious as the Green Giant beating up Godzilla . How are both of those ideas not awesome ? Clean line work , killer typography and some nice color choices dominate Jeremys work , I have no idea how the guy can manipulate those vectors as much as he can . <h> 3 Comments <p> Beautiful , they totally remind me of those skateboard deck designs and stickers from the 80s early 90s especially the 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was very into skateboarding those days , then I failed as skateboarder and moved to design ahahah

Escher is probably most known for his impossible architecture and landscape drawings , showcasing his play on perspective and point of view to create structures which ultimately can not exist . <p> As beautifully crafted as these images are , I have always been more captivated by Eschers pattern works . His ability to create a fluid and seamless plane of repeated images fitting perfectly togather is both unrivaled and mind-boggling . I bought a thick book years ago which breaks down and analyzes the mathematical formulas behind his patterns , which I proceeded to start reading countless times . To this day , his work still makes little sense to me : ) <p> Definitely an inspiration . I bought a print of Metamorphose at the Escher museum in The Hague , which is a 15 or so foot long by 9 ? tall print . Posted it along my stairwell so when I go up and down the stairs , I can follow the transition of patterns and impossible architecture <p> Thanks for this , James . Its nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its so easy to just get caught up in what 's ahead in design , and staying up to date on the latest trends . As artists , we need to remember the massive artistic leaps that have been made by our predecessors . <p> I would argue that our greatest inspiration as artists and designers should come from what has stood the test of time , rather than only looking to our contemporaries for inspiration . <p> I 've always been fascinated by Eschers work as well , whenever I see his stuff I cant help but try to parse out the steps in creating it and I believe part of my brain melts in the process . What 's the name of the " thick book " you mentioned ? <p> A personal favourite of mine is the one where the lizards in the pattern crawl out , become " three-dimensional " , breahte steam , and then return to the pattern . It not only looks cool , but it combines his more photorealistic style with his pattern work , and also has his pattern represented in perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what you should do with it .

@@121792132 @10792132/ <h> Green Lantern poster : Process <p> Last week I released my version of the Green Lantern movie poster ( seen above ) , which I worked on in the studio over the course of 2 days from sketch to final . It was a lot of fun to create something based on my childhood hero , so I took care in keeping as much material as I could in order to show how I went about creating the design . So now , its time to look at the Green Lantern poster process . <p> Back in 1983 whenever me and the neighborhood kids played Superfriends , I was always Green Lantern because I thought he had the coolest powers . I even went to the extent of making my own little Green Lantern power rings out of paper , not until this one right here : <p> Outside of thinking his powers were cool and his ring iconic , Lantern has the best logo in the DC Universe aside from the staples of Superman and Batman . All of these aspects of the character led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release for the upcoming film starring Ryan Reynolds , and its complete lack of showing Lanterns ring . I wont get into a big rant about the industry as I 'd be preaching to the choir . Modern film posters are n't  geared around art and design anymore , they revolve around whoever is starring in these things in hopes of drawing fans of the actors , unfortunately not the content . <p> Just to be clear , I 'm not riffing on the quality of the official poster because its beautifully crafted . I just feel the essence and iconic elements of the character was lost under the need to showcase Reynolds . That 's all . <p> So I took it upon myself to design a poster the way I would want to see it , focusing on Lanterns iconic power ring , its logo and the classic Green Lantern costume ( or at least a portion of it ) . Let 's get rockin. <h> i . Sketching <p> Like I 've said many times on my broadcasts I start every project with the sketchbook , I started drawing up come rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I wanted to focus on the ring , but wanted to do something strong , iconic yet simple . Since the ring is actually really small , I needed a way of making it look interesting and powerful . After doodling up around 10 sketches , I decided the way to go was simply showing Lanterns fist raised in the air with green light energy shooting out . <p> I 'm sure the redesigned Lantern costume for the movie will look cool onscreen , but you just cant beat the classic design . Hal Jordans white gloves were a must as the green ring contrasts beautifully on white , it just makes sense from a design standpoint . Shown here are a few of the reference images I dug up online , the Superpowers figure from 1984 ( which I still own ) , the cover design for New Frontier #6 created by Darwyn Cooke and an Alex Ross painting because I love those green lights . <p> In the case of the fist design , I really wanted to capture what Darwyn did on New Frontier . His hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . Once I had all of these references gathered along with my sketches , I had a good concept and direction going but I knew the biggest problem I would hit : where was this gloved fist going to come from ? <h> ii . Reference photos <p> After looking around some stock photo sites for hands and fists , I knew I was never going to find a good looking hand at the proper angle . Everything I found had something wrong with it , plus there was the issue of getting a ring on there . I decided I 'd do it myself and take some photos using my own hand to get exactly the angle I needed . I even had my own Green Lantern ring on hand thanks to my pals at Strange Adventures . <p> My photo set-up was hilarious . I grabbed my Canon Powershot , my Rock Band mic stand and a dollar store flashlight pointed at the ring to match the lighting I wanted in the final poster . It worked great and I snapped a number of shots in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light . It did n't  , the fist was still the winner . <h> iii . Digital sketch <p> This next step is what I call the digital sketch . After working on a number of posters over the years I found myself naturally gravitating to this middle step between the sketchbook and building the final design , where I build a pre-viz rough version of how the composition might be . I use pre-made elements that work as well as elements I 'll be using later in the final . <p> In this digital sketch for the Lantern poster , I used one of the hand photos I took in the previous step , a bunch of lighting effects I had on hand and some cosmic imagery from NASAs website . My concern was n't making the glove or anything look convincing , moreso to have a quick study to ensure I was still on the right creative path . My initial idea was to use more blues in the background to make the green energy stand out , but it made the palette look bleached out . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a quick vector base for the glove . <p> This step took a few hours to nail down , but it was hugely helpful before I moved on to creating the final poster build . Now that my planning was complete , it was time to start building my elements . <h> iv . Pencils and vectors <p> Ill be the first to admit , I kind of painted myself into a corner with this part . My goal was to make the fist look physical with weight and definition , but I did n't  want it to look like a photograph OR an illustration . Yeah , easy task huh ? I had to build and rip apart the hand design 3 times over before I got the process down and could achieve the effect I wanted . Even tried one version where I digitally painted the entire thing , it looked awful . I had to go analog , man . <p> I printed off a copy of the fist photograph and grabbed my handy tracing paper . I taped everything down on my sketch table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist to look , taking into account the glove , highlights and shadows . I tried to do this step in Illustrator but it was far too much guesswork , I needed to pull it away from the computer and do this step by hand to have complete control . <p> I then scanned the pencils , brought the drawing into Illustrator and mapped out all the elements in vector while experimenting with every gradient in there . The drawing was HUGELY helpful , something I 'll be taking into account with future posters . It was a great mix of realism and illustration and even looked like Hals hand . <p> The ring was the easy part . Having a plastic ring onhand was a big help , but it was just a matter of matching the perspective and hitting the right combination of selective gradients. <h> v. Bringing it all together <p> Things got a bit tricky here . Despite the gradient work , the vectors still looked really flat and I wanted something more substantial to give strength to the fist . I managed to achieve this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you can see by the image above , I used a green tint and a greyscale version of my fist and set them to Overlay in Photoshop . This gave the otherwise flat vectors a more physical look , like there was a human hand in there somewhere . Its totally an illusion but it created the effect I wanted . <p> I could n't get the proper fabric folds in Illustrator that I needed , this was a glove afterall , so I searched around Thinkstock and got some nice images of folded linen and satin which worked perfect for getting those wrinkles . I changed the images to either green or greyscale , and laid them over the vectors using blending modes Multiply and Soft Light . They worked great , kind of a fluke . <p> After the fist was built , it was just a matter of adding the green light energy , a few background elements and some selective shading . I 'm not going to get too deep into how these were created because there are a bazillion tutorials online showing cool light effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shard elements and a few photographs I had onhand of flares and lights . Most of these lights were switched to greyscale , then I overlayed some green on top to keep things more dynamic . It involved a lot of experimentation . <p> And finally , I added the final content from the Green Lantern oath as well as the 2011 logo , eluding to the release of the upcoming film . Done ! <p> The process behind this poster was extremely different then what I 'm used to , but it was an excellent journey to nail down the effect I wanted . Having to create that hand from scratch was a strange one , but I 'm happy to say its ME wearing that Green Lantern ring . Yeah ! I hope you had a good time gaining a bit of insight behind this poster because I had a great time creating it .

We got to the bottom of some heavy issues , talked about growing up , discussed a pile of art and played with some toys . We hung out in my home studio and even ventured them around my hometown a bit to show them some Dartmouth sights . <p> Absolutely thrilled that Lynda , one of the biggest damn names in our industry , came to my little town to hang out . You can watch the FULL DOCUMENTARY via the Vimeo movie above . Enjoy ! <p> Absolutely honoured to have been interviewed by the crack team at Adobe Inspire Magazine , and featured in this months edition .

Have fun everyone , and I 'll see you soon . <p> When Steve Jobs passed away on October 5th , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . Parked in front of the computer watching tweets go by , dominated with news , stories and tributes to Jobs . I popped open Illustrator and created a little Sad Mac icon my own little tribute . Nothing original , obviously , but my own little version . <p> I ended up sending the icon to Newsweek magazine which was used it in their Steve Jobs commemorative issue , which just landed on my doorstep . My little Mac sits at the center of the inside front cover , on full black . A perfect spot for the little tribute , now seen by people worldwide . <p> Last week I had the pleasure to sit down with my friends Ryan and Stephen for a big interview session on their show TV Party . This was the first time Ive ever been on the radio . Awesome time , really laid back and we talked for an hour and a half on all my projects , design thoughts and other rad topics . Here you go : <p> The reason Im excited to put this online is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town and Ryan has been a good friend of mine for years , so he brought up some funny stories involving some local static I caused over the years .

And Stephen , if you read this shoot me your Twitter link and I 'll hook ya up ! <p> I have gotten reports that the issue of Wired featuring some of my illustrations is now out in Europe . I was hired by the kind folks at Wired last month to design some original type pieces for use in their article about the mighty Quora . Other then the direction " Make the letters look big and flashy " , I was allowed to come up with whatever I wanted . I experimented a bit with line work and halftones , something I have n't really done before now . Shown here is the 2-page spread ( top ) as well as two drop caps designed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have to tip my hat to Wired for making the suggestion of pulling the tones back a bit . It added some realism to the design and made everything come together . Wired are fantastic clients , always enthusiastic and fun to work with . <p> This issue should be out now in Europe and hitting the shelves here in North America real soon . <p> That 's right , Advanced Photoshop Magazine #77 will feature a Signalnoise design on its cover worldwide . The kind folks over at the magazine contacted me about using my revised Tron Legacy poster for the cover , which could not have come at a better time considering the film is due out in a mere few weeks . <p> My original design appears to be reversible , like a raincoat , as the cover features my poster upside-down and works quite well with the type . I never would have expected that . Additionally I was included in the feature article 40 Expert Secrets Revealed where I talk about some process and technique stuff .

@@121792135 @10792135/ <p> Started combining some of these little experiments , which resulted in the first version of my rainbow sun . <p> I then simplified my previous logo last year into the current version . <p> I was hanging out with my buddy Nathan the other day who I actually worked with at an agency a few years ago . He told me he was rooting around some of my old files looking for something and came across a big Illustrator file full of logo experiments . Now , these experiments were actually for a client at the time but what I was building and exploring was axed before it was even shown . Bummer , right ? <p> But everything happens for a reason . I liked the progression and experiments so much that I ended up using them directly to develop the current Signalnoise logo .

But I 've always been a fan of the London 2012 Olympics logo , so what do I know , ha ha . <p> I 'd say you kinda did sketch it , just in Illustrator not on paper . A sketch is defined as a preliminary **25;210;TOOLONG of ideas not as pencil on paper . Tools &amp; media are irrelevant these days . I see a lot of educators demanding ideas start on paper and I think its an outdated idea , the mouse is a tool just like the pencil and the screen a medium just like paper , its perfectly logical that you can sketch with it so long as we remember what sketching is and do n't  just reach for the Type tool and start choosing typefaces ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see where ideas start &amp; how they meander along the way to completion . <p> Right on , Dave . Its so easy to be critical of your own logomaybe a group of designers should design each others logos instead of doing their own haha . James , the fact that you really , truly love your own logo is an awesome thing . No need to change it , especially for a more literal representation . <p> Hey Dave , as an out sider looking at your logo , I think it basically works well . The only critique I may have is that it is seems quite large on the page , as it takes up the whole header , which is valuable web real estate . For instance , see how James logo is fairly small at the top of this page . <p> I think also , it could be balanced a bit more , the mark looks quite large compared to the copy . Overall , though I like it . <p> I hope this helps ? Ive been redesiging my identity at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever had . Nothings ever good enough ! <p> Paul Thats not a bad idea !

Looking at it again , I think your points are well-taken . Smaller and less-dominating would be an easy thing to try out . <p> In closing , I 'd simply like to say how much I appreciate this community of designers . You guys rock ! I 'm sure many of us miss the days of the SNBC broadcasts , and cant wait for another spur of the moment announcement from Mr. White . <p> I love seeing other designers processes for creating logos ! Great stuff James .

The anti-aliasing on the typeface you chose for " DESIGN " is a bit fuzzy ( most evident on the " E " ) . I 'd get in there with a 1px brush and try to touch it up , or choose a different typeface altogether . Maybe its just me though , I 'm a very stringent pixel-pusher . <p> I feel weird leaving feedback without anything of my own to show , my portfolio site is dead at the moment . <p> I always wondered how you devised your mark sir , I also noticed that Abduzeedo went with a spetrum approach also . But recently he has changed his mark to yellow and black . Both of you guys are in my opinion designers to be admired and to learn from . Thanks much

A lot of people have vacation around this time that spans the week . Not all , I realize . <p> Since my parents live only an hour away , I go home for the annual White Christmas and hang out there for a few days before heading back , leaving me with around 4 days to do what I want .

I know 2011 brought some new readers to my corner of the internet so presented here is a rapid fire , pared down summary of favorite projects from this year and the stories behind them . A rough outline of this years work . 2011 seems to have blown by at hyperspeed , but it was a big year for all of us . <p> Here we go , the Best of Signalnoise 2011 . <p> January 2011 : Year Zero for OFFF Barcelona I was asked by the kind folks who were organizing OFFF Barcelona to contribute a piece to their publication which was available at the conference . I decided to take an illuminati approach to the idea and put together this futuristic , neon-clad- pyramid . It landed proudly in the Year Zero book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brush text " in my work . Something I would revisit throughout the year . <p> February 2011 : Signalnoise Poster for The Sword After seeing a tweet from my favorite metal band looking for an artist to create some visuals , I jumped at the opportunity with- ferocity . I set aside some hours one weekend and created this poster for The Sword , playing off some of the ideas of their latest record , Warp Riders . Without having any previous contact with the boys , I fired it off to them and they loved it . The poster was used for their Australian and- European- tours , and they commissioned me shortly after to design a t-shirt for their tour with Kyuss Lives . <p> March 2011 : Hobo With a Shotgun poster - It was a big year for Dartmouth . Hobo With a Shotgun was unleashed on the world by Jason Eisener and his crew , and I was asked to design a poster for them . I spent a lot of time learning new digital painting techniques for this one , really pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result , and this was used as a little promo tool for the premiere here in town . I also designed the Hobo logo . <p> March 2011 : Help Japan - After the earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan on March 11th , I created the Help Japan poster in order to sell online to raise money for relief efforts . The design quickly went viral and spread all over the world in a few days . It was used by fundraising events around the globe and sparked an array of design efforts online to raise money for Japan . My poster raised $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross . <p> June 2011 : Signalnoise Identity Revision - I went through an identity crisis in the middle of the year and decided to do a refresh of my rainbow sun and Signalnoise wordmark . It was scary upon first launch because I 've become so used to my previous version , but after using the new mark for the last 6 months I can honestly say it was a good move . Much easier to use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Explorer - This image popped into my head while I was running in a rainstorm to catch the ferry . Not really sure where it came from or what it was for , but certainly a poster design that I was proud of . It brought together a few new techniques I learned this year and was a fun , abstract concept to explore . <p> August 2011 : - Tutorial Culture vs . Two Goldfish An article I wrote concerning the friction between learning vital skills on your own through experimentation , and the saturation of online tutorials we see today . I talk about some of the issues that have come up , and how I relate that to my own creative development- throughout the 90s and 2000s . The article sparked a very interesting dialogue between new and veteran designers , a wonderful exchange of outlooks and ideas . <p> August 2011 : NASA Mission Patches - I decided I was going to challenge myself to do some logo/patches for NASA . This was a self-initiated endeavour to get me out of my comfort zone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been using Illustrator- consistently- since 95 , but the last few years its always been in- conjunction- with Photoshop .

What started as my own little tribute , ended up being used by Newsweek magazine in their Steve Jobs commemorative issue gracing the entire inside front cover . This little guy still chokes me up a bit . <p> October 2011 : DRIVE movie poster - After seeing the film DRIVE I knew immediately I wanted to create a poster for it .

The crew behind the event liked one of the designs so much it became the new official FITC logo being used across all events . Its not often that I get to design logos these days , so I 'm very proud of this one and was happy to help out my friends in the process . <p> November 2011 : Jay and Silent Bob Get Old Canadian Tour poster After seeing a tweet by director- Kevin Smith asking Canadian artists to submit any artwork they may have to be used as a tour poster , I jumped at the opportunity and designed this Jay and Silent Bob Get Old piece .

I worked with a bunch of great clients during 2011 on some enjoyable projects , but everything I listed in the post shares a very important detail . All of these projects were born out of self-initiation . I started these because I wanted to work on them , because they meant something to me . I did n't  think any of these projects would grow into anything substancial , I just threw myself into them because its what I do . If you love what you do , it shows in your work , man .

Once again , all proceeds are going to relief efforts in Japan . <p> Big thanks to my good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take these shots as we packed orders . <p> Ive been talking about working on this poster for a couple of months now , and I 'm super happy to have been given the green light by the hobo boys to launch it . Here is the Signalnoise poster design for the upcoming film Hobo With a Shotgun . Ive been waiting close to 3 years to work on this thing , so I was thrilled when Jason and Rob asked me to get rockin on it . I have known Jason and Rob for a few years now , meeting them through the comic book crowd here in Halifax . Great guys . <p> here 's a bit of back story . I was asked by director Jason Eisener to come up with a logo for " this thing he was making for the SXSW Grindhouse trailer competition " back in 2008 . He sent me a cut of the first Hobo trailer and I cracked up at its content , awesome cuts and obvious homage to independent action flicks of the 80s . I had very little time , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much they kept for the theatrical release . <p> I even designed the logo for The Plague , which will also be appearing in the film . Keep your eyes out for it . <p> Fast forward , the boys ended up winning the SXSW Grindhouse Trailer competition and started the process of making the full length feature film . Our whole crew lost our minds when we heard Jason managed to slate Rutger Hauer for the lead role , goddamn Roy from Bladerunner ! The boys even fought to shoot the whole movie in our hometown of Halifax/Dartmouth . As you can well imagine , we are all mighty proud of these guys for keeping their work home-grown , adequately putting our little city on the film map , shotguns ablazing . <p> I worked on this poster for about 2 months . I knew early on that I wanted to do something different from the typical film poster , something painterly like film posters from the 80s . I started researching guys like Drew Struzan , Bob Peak and Bill Sienkiewicz to get a good idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of drawing up front because I had no idea how to approach this beast . Did I bite off more then I could chew ? Absolutely , but my stubbornness reigned supreme as I was n't about to throw in the towel . <p> What I was aiming for was a weird mix of digital and analog . I did n't  want this poster to look like a " Photoshop painting " with obvious digital brush stokes and smooth edges . It needed to look like I beat the hell out of a canvas yet included computer effects and photographic elements . " Digital , yet not digital . But . . . digital ! " . I 'm my own worst enemy . My PSD file reached 230 layers at close to 5 gigs as I kept all of my digital paints separate for fear of messing up . Many hours and Photoshop layers later , the final poster emerged . here 's a detail shot of the digital paints . <p> Stay tuned as I will be posting some behind-the-scenes images documenting my progress as I worked on this beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly sold out earlier this week , I have had numerous emails in support of the cause and inquiries about when the poster will be printed for a second time . I am happy to announce that the poster is available once again in the new storefront . <p> The initial run of posters was a small compared to the immediate interest it received , something I could not have predicted when I launched the initiative in my small online store . But I would like to send a very warm thank-you to my friends at Merchline in Florida and Precision Atlantic here in Halifax . Without their immediate and generous efforts to help me out I could not have gotten more posters available to those interested in contributing to this cause . Nathan Murray at Merchline set me up with an excellent storefront with the capability of handling larger volumes of orders , and Tony Martin at Precision Atlantic for swiftly getting the posters printed on such incredibly short notice . This could not have happened without them . <p> Once again , all proceeds generated from sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8.9 earthquake and tsunami of March 11 . The first run of posters generated a donation of $7250.00 in 2 days which was donated to the Canadian Red Cross , and I would like to extend another huge thanks to those who stepped up and contributed to the cause . <p> Alternatively , if you would like more direct methods of donating to organizations dealing with relief efforts in Japan , here are a number of options : <p> The past few days have been a bit of a blur , so I wanted to post an update and explanation here on the blog regarding the Help Japan poster and the funds it raised for disaster relief after the 8.9 quake last Friday . I 've received numerous emails , tweets and comments , most of which I have n't had a chance to respond to individually . So I will update you as best I can right here . <p> I want to thank everyone for your immense support in spreading the word via your blogs and Twitter over the last few days . Your positive feedback and willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated to the Canadian Red Cross to help with the relief efforts in Japan . Its incredible to see so many leap at the opportunity to give through this initiative and my thanks goes out to each and every one of you . If you would like some alternative methods of donating , please refer to my previous post . <p> So , what happens now ? Ive been busy sorting out all of the necessary components to get the first run of posters into peoples hands as soon as possible . I plan on starting shipping at the end of this week ( or early next week ) once all the supplies have arrived , and I would like to thank you for your patience as I rush to nail down all the final details . <h> A second run of posters <p> Many people have been inquiring about a second run of Help Japan posters going toward a second donation , and this is something I will be sorting out once this current batch is underway . I will have more details by the end of this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1-man operation . I wish I could say I had the capacity to take on all orders immediately , but unfortunately I cant because I will be packing and shipping everything myself . This initiative is very grassroots and the incredible support you have shown it caught me very much by surprise these past few days . I will be doing everything I can to keep things moving on the first run of posters , along with the second run when I have the capacity . <p> So again , a huge thanks for your generosity and willingness to help , everyone . Its truly appreciated . And if you are looking for alternative methods of donating to help the relief efforts in Japan , please refer to my previous post which lists a number charitable organizations . <p> Update March 17 , 2011 : The Help Japan poster has been restocked and is available now in the new storefront .

Hope to see you there ! <p> Check out this excellent Montreal Meets recap video put together by event founder Francois Hoang . In all honesty , I did n't  even know there was a video camera around for a lot of these shots so I 'm seeing this footage for the first time . Francois did a great job of capturing the vibe of the event while adding some nice sentimental moments in there . Watching this makes me wish I was back in Montreal hanging out with my pals .

When I was little my parents enrolled me in swimming lessons , tossing me half-naked into a group of other kids I barely knew in order to ensure I would n't sink to the bottom of a pool like a stone . Well , it worked and today I can swim like doofus whenever I need to . <p> The Canadian Red Cross swimming lessons were broken up into " colors " . When you completed a level you were awarded with that badge color . I always liked the design of those badges , really smart with the swimmer aligning with the wave . I managed to find these online last week and wanted to show them off , mostly because these are the four I got when I was a kid . Maroon basically meant " He can dive , but not well . " <p> Not sure if you have these in other countries , or if us Canadians were the lucky ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Anyone know ? <p> Dude . I miss the colours . They changed to numbers in Canada as well somewhere during the 90s . I became a lifeguard and awarded the number badges to kids , but the colours were still the best . : ) <p> I have seen a few badges from other countries . Some places use animals ( I think the YMCA has an animal system , or did at one time ) . And when you get past the colour/number levels a metallic system is really common . <p> The Royal Life Saving Society system ( Bronze Medallion , etc. ) is suprisingly common around the world too . <p> It depends on what age/level they 're in . The kids are in lessons now . Alexis just gets stickers , but Shannon get badges . I 'm not sure if he got any yet they finish this week . But I 'll have a look to see if they still look the same and let you know . <p> Hi when I young 6 years old my parents brought me local aquatic centre to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time it took me 7 years just to get all the badge I complete when I was in sec 2 then I went for lifeguard training it took me 3 years when I was 17 I got a job a local aquatic centre pcac as a lifeguard Then when I was 19 my apparment when up in flame I lost everything the badges and medal I want to replace it to show to my kids I 35 years old <p> Hi There , As everyone else here , I have very fond memories of my swimming classes and my achievements in swimming . I still have my swimming card with all the levels completed but sadly I can not find my badges anywhere . I would really love to find them online if possible . Can anyone recommend how I can do that ? I have moved many times but have everything elseit is a mystery to me as to where they have disappeared to . Thanks so very much ! <p> Thanks for posting these ! To anyone who still has their cards , can you please tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour levels ? My husband I remember it being pretty onerous , but wonder if it was n't actually that bad . Did n't  we also have to do mouth to mouth resuscitation ? ! <p> This will tell my age lol , but mine had the little guy , the cross , large round patches and S marks on them , for beginner , inter and senior , lifesaving 1 and 2 , synchronized swimming 1 and 2 , was going for my gold medallian which required 3 or 4 more badges ( needed 1 more ) , you can try searching for them , the Red Cross are where the badges come from .

Joe and I have been scheming on this one for the better part of a year and I was thrilled to have my first solo show with such rad people . <p> So here is the full spread of all 15 original pieces I created for the show , inspired by the beautiful painted backgrounds of cartoons I watched as a kid . Scooby-Doo , Superfriends , Spider-man , Masters of the Universe if you do n't  know what I 'm talking about please dig up some old episodes and scope those backgrounds . Wonderful stuff .

@@121792144 @10792144/ <h> Lord of the Logos , Christophe Szpajdel <p> Things are going to get heavy around here . If you are a metal head , you might already be familiar with this guy , but for those who are n't  allow me to introduce you to the mighty Lord of the Logos , Christophe Szpajdel . Christophe is a pillar in the underground metal scene , designing hundreds and hundreds of band logos for groups all over the world including the likes of Emperor , where he created their iconic , symmetrical and often mimicked logo . <p> Some of his logos are unmistakable in readability , while others are cryptic . Some are straight up type while others are illustrated and atmospheric . Some are beautiful while others are macabre . Now it must be said that this style of logo is not for everyone . Being a metal guy I absolutely love this stuff , and the cryptic nature of these is almost a code among metal heads . Think what you will of these , but what is painfully obvious across the board is Szpajdels unrelenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready for this ? All of the logos you see in this post were hand-drawn . With all of our fancy-pants computers today we cant come close to the conceptual execution Christophe can achieve with simply a pencil and paper . <p> I selected a handful of logos for this post , but going through Christophes portfolio for favorite images is like walking into a forest and finding your favorite branch . Swing over to his Flickr stream to see a tonne of his band logos and photography , and there 's also an interview with Christophe over at Maelstrom . If you like what you see I highly recommend picking up his book aptly titled Lord of the Logos . Thanks to my buddy Fulton , I have a copy right by my side . <h> 17 Comments <p> I love the style but I have no idea what most of them say . From an artistic point of view I think they are great . From a " branding " point of view they more or less pointless they are way too complex . <p> It should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death metal , black metal , etc ) often reject the typical notions of branding , or even rebel against it . Having logos created that are often unreadable by most can almost be seen as code within the genre . It works for them , and enforces their stand . However you are absolutely right , they are very complex from a standard branding point of view . : ) <p> I spent ages looking at this guys work for research in my graphics class . The assignment is to create the brand and packaging for a band . I 've made something Simpler : ) still heavily inspired by this guy though ! <p> LOVE Christophes work . Seriously talented . The way he can visualize a word or title and put it to paper is brilliant . While his Death/Black/Heavy Metal logos are iconic , his art deco work is not to be underestimated Beautiful . One of the hardest working guys in the business . <p> Its amazing to see how one person basically defined the look of an entire genre of music . I remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death/black bands i used to stare for hours at their album covers : sometimes trying to decipher the logo , sometimes simply being amazed by all the hidden messages withing the artwork itself . <p> There 's something about being a metal head that allows you to accept all sorts of weird/crazy shit . After I started getting into bands like Opeth , Agalloch , Nile , etc. , a new world opened up to me . All of a sudden , there was some epic beauty in all of the darkness surrounding metal . <p> If you like these logos , you should check out the art by the Converge singer , Jacob Bannon . He has made a massive contribution to the metal scenes aesthetics . 
@@121792145 @10792145/ <p> I came across the illustration work of Iain Macarthur a couple of weeks ago via the french magazine Be Street , and felt compelled to hunt down and post some of his work . I rarely buy magazines based on the cover design , but this was certainly an exception when I saw Iains cover for the current Be Street , which is the topmost image above . Beautiful . <p> I grabbed a handful of Iains work to feature here , but do n't  be fooled as he has a very diverse selection of drawings and designs on all of his various portfolio accounts . I really enjoy his intricate drawing ability , creating textured and detailed work full of interest and wonder . You can stare at any one of these drawings and continue to see new little things in there . <p> I recommend checking out more from this UK artist via his blog , his Behance , and his Carbonmade . And while you 're at it , swing by Be Street to check out this awesome magazine . <p> The guys over at Official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for the past while , all of which are available for purchase and download .

But I really do enjoy those wacky robots . <p> If you follow me on Twitter , you might have noticed me mention Brass Tack Apparel a few times . Brass Tack is a conceptual clothing line created by Joshua Smith , the mighty Hydro74 . Ive been a fan of Joshs work for a long time , and it was really exciting to see him update his Twitter with new designs as he built this project from the ground up . <p> Not only are the designs beautiful , but there is a solid idea behind what he is doing . Its best said in his own words : <p> " Brass Tack is a Orlando based concept from the mastermind Hydro74 . The idea is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual idealism founded on a secret society level . The Brass Tack clothing line is dedicated to lush quality , simply stated themes , unique imagery that centers around graphical interpretations of the lost art of underground secret social systems that hide their ideology in plain sight . The core concept in the end is never to establish , but in the end , it has always been there or lived in some form or another .

Its Spring and if you are looking for a spot to get some wicked new t-shirts , I highly recommend checking out The Brass Tack . <p> Alex Varanese is at it again , this time with a motion piece entitled " My Desk is 8-bit " . This work carries Alexs signature color palette and grittiness , injects some super fun NES visuals and audio and wrapped in a stop-motion style . Crazy idea inspired by the likes of Michel Gondry and R-Type ? Haha , love it ! <p> As some of you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small and simple Photoshop tutorial on how I achieved the rainbow shard effect seen in many of my poster designs over the last few years . What I showed to the crowd was a stripped down version so I could demonstrate easily and quickly how the effect was created in about 4 minutes . We cant have only those who attended have all the fun , so here is the web version of the tutorial in the exact way I presented it at the conference . <p> But before we begin , please PLEASE try experimenting with various steps along the way . I understand tutorials are meant to be a map from point A to point B where you can create the exact results shown , but screw that . Try your own stuff , add images , change the shapes , switch up the colors . Anyone can read and follow instructions , its the exploration and playing that makes it your own and can lead down other creative paths . I endorse learning , not replicating . <p> Bear that in mind , and let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , create some basic shapes using a few varying degrees of greys . Try to get a good range so they do n't  look so monotone . If you are looking to get things lining up later on , be sure to hold down the Shift key while making these so all lines are perfectly horizontal , vertical or 45- . <p> Experiment tip ! After you 've run through this tutorial once , try creating some other shapes to play with later on . Its super fun , trust me . <p> Step 2 : I originally used Flash in order to create these random little groups , but you really do n't  have to . Take the shapes you created in Step 1 and make a few groups with a variety of size and dispersal . Take a bit of time here to play with the shapes and get the groups looking as random and interesting as possible . If you are adjusting lengths , be sure to hold down the Shift key to maintain that 45- angle so things line up properly . <p> Experiment tip ! Seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you later . The more interesting the groups are here will improve depth later . Try using different shapes and arrangements to see what results they might yield . Think of these groups as your tools , the better they are the better they will work for you . <p> Step 3 : Copy and paste 2 of the groups you just created into Photoshop onto a black canvas , then drop the opacity of these layers down to 50% each . Expand the size of the shapes a bit so they bleed off . You can set the dimensions of the canvas to whatever you like , I just chose this format because my it was for my Keynote presentation . <p> Step 4 : Copy and paste 2 more groups of shapes into Photoshop on top of the previous ones from Step 3 . Again , expand the groups so they bleed off the edges of the canvas . <p> Step 5 : Set the Blending Mode of those 2 new layers of shapes to Overlay . You should now be able to see some interesting things happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip ! Try adding as many layers as you wish to this step . Also try adjusting the scale and opacity of the shapes to see what happens . <p> Step 6 : Now its time to add color . Create a new layer , select a full spectrum linear gradient and apply it across the canvas . I then selected the shapes below in order to apply a layer mask to the color layer . Looks pretty gross , huh ? <p> Experiment tip ! Try using different colors , radial gradients or using the airbrush tool to create custom color fills . <p> Step 7 : Set the Blending Mode of the color layer to Overlay , and set the opacity to around 35% . This coloring does n't  look too interesting but there is a method of applying color I discovered quite by accident , which is by way of layering colors over top of one another <p> Step 8 : Duplicate the color layer 3 times so you have 4 layers of color . This will improve the saturation of your colors without over-blowing or pixelating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your color layers individually of they are reacting too harshly with one another . I included my layers palette in this image to show you how I have things set up so far . <p> Here is the clean version of Step 8 . <p> Step 9 : Now we are going to add some subtle highlights and shading to the shapes in order to create a bit more dimension . Create a new layer and set the Blending Mode to Overlay . Select the gradient tool with a setting of white to transparent , and apply a radial gradient to the upper-right corner . Do the same steps and apply a black radial gradient to the lower-left corner . You can adjust the opacity of this overlay if the highlight or shadow are too harsh . <p> Experiment tip ! Try using this method of highlight and shadow in different areas to either bring elements forward or knock parts back . It can add quite a bit of dimension to your work . <p> And there you go , nothing to it . <p> This is a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of experimentation particularly in the early steps . Its nothing to just follow instructions to yield to same outcome , the real power comes from playing with elements along the way to see what results might come about . <p> So have fun , and feel free to post your creations in the comments . I 'd love to see what you come up with . <p> Its finally starting to feel like spring around Halifax . The weather is warmer , the ducks are back at the park , and the leaves are starting to make appearances . This is the best time of year to be in Halifax , if you live here you know what I 'm talking about . This time of year normally brings Spring Cleaning with it , and its no different with the Studio . Ill be working on a few changes , here we go . <p> The past 8 months or so have been great in terms of Signalnoise Studio getting lots of new work for great clients . I officially registered the company back in February and started jumping through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . A lot of paperwork , but I had some great people to help me out along the way who gave wonderful advice . I 'm still learning the ropes , but its going well . <p> But , here 's the thing . With so much client work on the go it effectively took up all of my daytime hours as well as a lot of my own time , which is usually spent working on posters , writing for the blog , surfing for cool art , sketching ideas , writing emails . . . you know , the fun things that made my Signalnoise brand what it is . I understand deadlines reign supreme , but I found myself less enthused because I did n't  have that personal creative time needed to keep me excited and make me laugh . Speaking at FITC Toronto and having the Signalnoise art show was a wonderful break in the midst of all this because it gave me some time to represent Signalnoise on my own terms and meet lots of wonderful people as a result . <p> So , things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will officially be moving over to working at the Signalnoise Studio full time . Its daunting and a bit scary ( which I 'm told all entrepreneurs feel ) , but I think at this point its time to crank things up to 11 and see what this new landscape might yield . For the duration of my career Ive only worked at other agencies , so this is all new to a punk like me . Guess well see how it goes . <p> The one thing I never wanted to do was hang the Open sign in the front window , sit at my desk with a smile on my face and wait for business to come knocking . That whole scenario scares the livin hell out of me , to be honest . So Ive been working on a new department of the Signalnoise brand over the past little while which will take me in a bit of a new direction . I touched on this topic during my last Broadcast and I 'm busy aligning all the things necessary to get the ball rolling . This is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant offer many more details just yet , but the coming weeks will bring many updates as I document what is going on in all kinds of fun ways . Keep watch on my Twitter for little tidbits as well . <p> Another change is one for you guys . Having been caught up in freelance work , my blog writing , email replying and broadcast schedule went out the window and that really upset me . I always wanted Signalnoise to be a kind of hub for meeting and talking to other people who enjoy art and design to whatever capacity , so to have that put on the backburner really sucked . That being said , I 'm working on a more solid schedule of updates for the blog with new content and inspiration stuff , as well as implementing a solid bi-weekly Signalnoise Broadcast schedule to keep a more solid connection with everyone . This might even be upgraded to a weekly Broadcast when I get rolling , but well see . <p> That 's the scoop , gang . A few big personal changes coming over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As always , thanks very much to everyone for swinging by the blog and broadcasts to say hello . Community , man , that 's what its all about . Now its time to turn up the heat . <p> If you were unable to tune into the " 2 Hours of Power " live broadcasts yesterday , here are the recorded versions of both Signalnoise Broadcast 7 and the GSG Live Cast . <p> The 2 Hours of Power kicked off with Signalnoise Broadcast 7 where I discussed some process items , Photoshop techniques , video games , industry stuff and other topics . Then my pal Nick Campbell , the Greyscalegorilla took over with the GSG Live Cast where he discussed some personal processes , inspirational advice , industry stuff and many more helpful topics . <p> Doing these broadcasts and touching base with the online creative community is always a good time , but it was even better being part of a small line-up of live content . Feels like my group of online friends got a bit bigger yesterday . As always , mad thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce that this week Signalnoise Broadcast 7 will be happening alongside my good pal and gorilla Nick Campbell with his GSG Live broadcast , a team-up we are calling the 2 Hours of Power ! These 2 broadcasts will be happening tomorrow , May 19th starting with Signalnoise Broadcast 7 at 1pm CST and immediately followed by GSG Live at 2pm CST . <p> Ive been tuning into Nicks broadcasts for quite some time , always packed with useful and informed advice on technology , industry stuff , processes and a whole lot more . His casts are essential watching for aspiring creatives and veteran nerds alike . Awesome stuff . <p> When the time comes , you can tune into GSG Livehere , and the Signalnoise Broadcasthere.

@@121792149 @10792149/ <p> Started combining some of these little experiments , which resulted in the first version of my rainbow sun . <p> I then simplified my previous logo last year into the current version . <p> I was hanging out with my buddy Nathan the other day who I actually worked with at an agency a few years ago . He told me he was rooting around some of my old files looking for something and came across a big Illustrator file full of logo experiments . Now , these experiments were actually for a client at the time but what I was building and exploring was axed before it was even shown . Bummer , right ? <p> But everything happens for a reason . I liked the progression and experiments so much that I ended up using them directly to develop the current Signalnoise logo . When people in the office- werent- looking , I 'd open that AI file to play with it and eventually landed on my rainbow sun . Funny how that happens , huh ? <p> So , shown here for the first time are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very different directions that all led to my final . A big thanks to Nathan for sending this file over , I had n't  seen it in years . <p> I quite like what 's going on in the weird ones ( ripped up and unfolded ) I do n't  know , maybe if they were animated or something . But I 've always been a fan of the London 2012 Olympics logo , so what do I know , ha ha . <p> I 'd say you kinda did sketch it , just in Illustrator not on paper . A sketch is defined as a preliminary **25;237;TOOLONG of ideas not as pencil on paper . Tools &amp; media are irrelevant these days . I see a lot of educators demanding ideas start on paper and I think its an outdated idea , the mouse is a tool just like the pencil and the screen a medium just like paper , its perfectly logical that you can sketch with it so long as we remember what sketching is and do n't  just reach for the Type tool and start choosing typefaces ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see where ideas start &amp; how they meander along the way to completion . <p> Right on , Dave . Its so easy to be critical of your own logomaybe a group of designers should design each others logos instead of doing their own haha . James , the fact that you really , truly love your own logo is an awesome thing . No need to change it , especially for a more literal representation . <p> Hey Dave , as an out sider looking at your logo , I think it basically works well . The only critique I may have is that it is seems quite large on the page , as it takes up the whole header , which is valuable web real estate . For instance , see how James logo is fairly small at the top of this page . <p> I think also , it could be balanced a bit more , the mark looks quite large compared to the copy . Overall , though I like it . <p> I hope this helps ? Ive been redesiging my identity at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever had . Nothings ever good enough ! <p> Paul Thats not a bad idea ! There 's always a chance you 'd end up with something you did n't  like from one of the other designers , but it would be fun exercise at the very least . <p> Jamie Thank you for taking the time to look and give feedback ! Looking at it again , I think your points are well-taken . Smaller and less-dominating would be an easy thing to try out . <p> In closing , I 'd simply like to say how much I appreciate this community of designers . You guys rock ! I 'm sure many of us miss the days of the SNBC broadcasts , and cant wait for another spur of the moment announcement from Mr. White . <p> I love seeing other designers processes for creating logos ! Great stuff James . I was curious what your logo might look like if the " petals " were a combination of the two colours they 're sandwiched between : http : //imgur.com/Awikj , I like your current version more , 12 colours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like your logo but there 's one small thing that I would fix . The anti-aliasing on the typeface you chose for " DESIGN " is a bit fuzzy ( most evident on the " E " ) . I 'd get in there with a 1px brush and try to touch it up , or choose a different typeface altogether . Maybe its just me though , I 'm a very stringent pixel-pusher . <p> I feel weird leaving feedback without anything of my own to show , my portfolio site is dead at the moment . <p> I always wondered how you devised your mark sir , I also noticed that Abduzeedo went with a spetrum approach also . But recently he has changed his mark to yellow and black . Both of you guys are in my opinion designers to be admired and to learn from . Thanks much

@@121792153 @10792153/ <h> Lord of the Logos , Christophe Szpajdel <p> Things are going to get heavy around here . If you are a metal head , you might already be familiar with this guy , but for those who are n't  allow me to introduce you to the mighty Lord of the Logos , Christophe Szpajdel . Christophe is a pillar in the underground metal scene , designing hundreds and hundreds of band logos for groups all over the world including the likes of Emperor , where he created their iconic , symmetrical and often mimicked logo . <p> Some of his logos are unmistakable in readability , while others are cryptic . Some are straight up type while others are illustrated and atmospheric . Some are beautiful while others are macabre . Now it must be said that this style of logo is not for everyone . Being a metal guy I absolutely love this stuff , and the cryptic nature of these is almost a code among metal heads . Think what you will of these , but what is painfully obvious across the board is Szpajdels unrelenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready for this ? All of the logos you see in this post were hand-drawn . With all of our fancy-pants computers today we cant come close to the conceptual execution Christophe can achieve with simply a pencil and paper . <p> I selected a handful of logos for this post , but going through Christophes portfolio for favorite images is like walking into a forest and finding your favorite branch . Swing over to his Flickr stream to see a tonne of his band logos and photography , and there 's also an interview with Christophe over at Maelstrom . If you like what you see I highly recommend picking up his book aptly titled Lord of the Logos . Thanks to my buddy Fulton , I have a copy right by my side . <h> 17 Comments <p> I love the style but I have no idea what most of them say . From an artistic point of view I think they are great . From a " branding " point of view they more or less pointless they are way too complex . <p> It should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death metal , black metal , etc ) often reject the typical notions of branding , or even rebel against it . Having logos created that are often unreadable by most can almost be seen as code within the genre . It works for them , and enforces their stand . However you are absolutely right , they are very complex from a standard branding point of view . : ) <p> I spent ages looking at this guys work for research in my graphics class . The assignment is to create the brand and packaging for a band . I 've made something Simpler : ) still heavily inspired by this guy though ! <p> LOVE Christophes work . Seriously talented . The way he can visualize a word or title and put it to paper is brilliant . While his Death/Black/Heavy Metal logos are iconic , his art deco work is not to be underestimated Beautiful . One of the hardest working guys in the business . <p> Its amazing to see how one person basically defined the look of an entire genre of music . I remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death/black bands i used to stare for hours at their album covers : sometimes trying to decipher the logo , sometimes simply being amazed by all the hidden messages withing the artwork itself . <p> There 's something about being a metal head that allows you to accept all sorts of weird/crazy shit . After I started getting into bands like Opeth , Agalloch , Nile , etc. , a new world opened up to me . All of a sudden , there was some epic beauty in all of the darkness surrounding metal . <p> If you like these logos , you should check out the art by the Converge singer , Jacob Bannon . He has made a massive contribution to the metal scenes aesthetics .

@@121792159 @10792159/ <p> A conversation with my pal Jerko yesterday prompted me to make this post about my favorite comic strip , Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson . I came across the strip quite by accident in grade 8 when I ordered " Yukon Ho ! " from Scholastic because I thought the cover looked funny . I was always looking for new things to draw , this kid and his tiger might be fun , right ? <p> Little did I know at the time how much of an impact Calvin and Hobbes would have on me , and that I would still be reading and appreciating it almost 20 years later . I identified a lot with Calvin and his hair-brained schemes that never worked or got finished . I was a lot like him at 6 years old , without the destructive behavior . The strip presented a really rational view of the world , especially how Calvin viewed what was going on around him and why he thought it was all rather silly or confusing . <p> When I was younger , I loved the wacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can appreciate more the dialogue , in particular the strips where Calvin and Hobbes are in the wagon and Calvin presents a florid depiction of life and experiences before the wagon crashes and Hobbes cracks a joke . I could get into more of the mechanics of the strip and the brilliance of the art itself , but I 'd be writing all day . <p> Outside of all the gross , awesome and hilarious bits the strip touched on ( like a beautifully rendered painting of a T-Rex flying a fighter jet ) , Calvin and Hobbes brings with it a heavy sense of nostalgia . I cant remember what strip it was , but Calvin made reference to his one summertime responsibility was how much fun he needed to cram into every day before his mother called him in for the night . I remember those days . That 's why I chose the images above , they are nice calm scenes with Calvin and Hobbes doing what they loved goofing off and creating adventures in their own little world . <p> In its medium , I put Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watterson did it the best , with honesty , and he cared more about the characters and their world than he did about fame and fortune . <p> I just recently became familiar with the awesome work of Indiana-based illustrator Jeremy Packer , also known as Zombie Yeti Studios . The topmost image was released a few months back with the launch of Brass Tack by Joshua Smith , but did n't  take note of who created it at the time . <p> I really enjoy modern illustrators who use new software to create imagery and ideas that are similar to old school metal , like White Zombie for example . Everything Jeremy creates would look smashing on a t-shirt , whether its as serious as a shark eating a skeleton or as hilarious as the Green Giant beating up Godzilla . How are both of those ideas not awesome ? Clean line work , killer typography and some nice color choices dominate Jeremys work , I have no idea how the guy can manipulate those vectors as much as he can . <p> This topic has been talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to take a moment and discuss it more specifically . I 've fielded a lot of questions about personal artistic growth , advice for young designers , and finding your way in this convoluted industry and I always try to incorporate the idea of staying positive into the replies . <p> Its difficult to have fun with your job , job-hunt or school work all the time given the curve balls thrown our way but its important to always have something you are looking forward to working on , ie. your own project . In my case , I 've worked with a variety of companies here in Halifax with ups and downs , but I never stopped working on my own little projects on my own time . I remember many days racing back to my apartment to keep working on that animation , or site , or poster , or drawing . That anticipation made me happy , that was the point . <p> Trying to stay positive clears your head and reduces personal limitations . In one of his talks , James Cameron said " Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " Also in Conan OBriens farewell speech on The Tonight Show he commented quite blatantly on this very topic . Check it out : <p> So stay positive , and keep working on those design and art projects that make you happy . And when the time is right , take a risk to align yourself with that thing you really want to do . <p> I wanted to start the week off right with a trip back to my childhood . I was a Nintendo kid since owning my first NES when I was 11 back in 1988 , and have never really deviated to any other systems . Outside of handhelds , I owned every system Nintendo put out with the exception of the N64 and am constantly barking at people who choose an XBox or PS3 over the Wii . Sorry gang , but " better graphics " is simply not a valid argument . : ) <p> So , shown here are a bunch of NES game covers . I do love all of these designs , but that 's not the reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond memories tied to all of these games . Staying up late with other kids playing Blades of Steel until our thumbs were sprained , getting yelled at by mom to go outside while playing Bionic Commando , amping up my team in Baseball Stars , yelling at my television every time Tyson knocked me down . So many memories . <p> If you were a video game kid ( or still are ) , you know what I 'm talkin about . Feel free to comment on your own favorites from back in the day , I 'd love to read your stories . <p> Due to the vastness of their portfolio , it was very difficult to choose a few choice posters from the shelves of Methane Studios . If you 're into looking at gig posters online , youve probably come across their work once or twice . Beautifully executed silk screened posters full of color , style , ideas and mediums . And if you can believe it , Methane is a 2-man operation consisting of Mark McDevitt and Robert Lee which started in 1998 making gig posters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all kinds of stars and clients including Turner Broadcasting , Honda , Liberty Mutual and more . <p> These guys are a testament that great things will happen if you work hard and do what you love . <p> Its impossible to get a good grasp of their portfolio here , so I urge you to check out their account on Gig Posters as well as their official site for more of their work . If you are an illustrator , photo manipulator or designer you will certainly be blown away by their versatility . I 'm off to make a band so I can hire these guys . : ) <p> I came across the illustration work of Iain Macarthur a couple of weeks ago via the french magazine Be Street , and felt compelled to hunt down and post some of his work . I rarely buy magazines based on the cover design , but this was certainly an exception when I saw Iains cover for the current Be Street , which is the topmost image above . Beautiful . <p> I grabbed a handful of Iains work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a very diverse selection of drawings and designs on all of his various portfolio accounts . I really enjoy his intricate drawing ability , creating textured and detailed work full of interest and wonder . You can stare at any one of these drawings and continue to see new little things in there . <p> I recommend checking out more from this UK artist via his blog , his Behance , and his Carbonmade . And while you 're at it , swing by Be Street to check out this awesome magazine . <p> Alex Varanese is at it again , this time with a motion piece entitled " My Desk is 8-bit " . This work carries Alexs signature color palette and grittiness , injects some super fun NES visuals and audio and wrapped in a stop-motion style . Crazy idea inspired by the likes of Michel Gondry and R-Type ? Haha , love it ! <p> Here is another LOST treat for all you like-minded fans out there . These amazing caricatures were created by famed comic book illustrator J. Scott Campbell . <p> Its great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show because I was a fan of his from waaaay back when he cut his teeth with Wildstorm Comics , laying down his bouncy pencils for Gen13 in the early 90s . I always enjoyed his playful style and he draws some hilariously sexy cartoon ladies , as seen in his Danger Girl series . <p> But just look at the incredible likenesses he captures in these drawings . I mean , check Sayid ! You can not get any closer then that , perfect expression . My pal Dave described Campbell as being " the new Mort Drucker " , and that 's a pretty accurate thought . I 'd love to see Campbell do more caricature work , man he s good at it . 
@@121792160 @10792160/ <p> Been designing a lot of patch designs over the last little while , and been loving every second of it . I 'm proud to show these mission patch-style logos created for the mighty National Film Board of Canada in support of their Space School initiative . Bit of a story here <p> About 2 years ago I designed a handful of patches for NASA , unofficially . See , NASA has been a dream client of mine since I was a little kid learning about the stars , SkyLab , space shuttles , the whole thing . So I tried to get NASAs attention through designing some patches and tweeting the hell out of them . In short it did n't  work , but I had some neat portfolio pieces in the end . Then a few months later I got a call from the NFB to design the suckers you see above , a direct result of those NASA patches . You never know what will happen when you put your stuff out there , man . <p> I was blown away when they launched the NFB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my logo on a bigass rocket . Dream come true .

Today they released their Made to Discover initiative featuring an amazing cliff-jumping short film that you should definitely check out . Opera reached out to Signalnoise to do some custom " boy scout style " patches to sync up with their idea of discovery . So Mystery Box and I got to work . <p> Shown above is the brand new website designed by my talented pal Radim Malinic , where you 'll see my little patches scattered throughout . The second image above shows some other styles and- variations- we explored before settling on the nice orange ones above .

@@121792161 @10792161/ <p> Simply love this painting Scott King created for ThePop.com . It seems to have only been used as a holding page for the site , which is a bit of a shame . Beautiful logo rendering , perfect contrast to the natural seascape . <p> Big thanks to Stratos Agianoglou and the mighty Sci-Fi-O-Rama for bringing the work of Chris Foss to my attention . I had seen his Elite design floating around Ffffound for a little while now but never knew who created it , or when . <p> Not only is Foss incredibly talented at creating epic space scenes with planets and ships , but the logo design he rendered for the Elite cover is stunning . Check out the posts on Sci-Fi-O-Rama for more by Chris Foss , as well as his official website . <p> Last weekend I was rummaging around my parents basement looking for old toys or comic books left over from my childhood ( I 'm a nostalgic guy ) and I stumbled upon quite the time capsule , my childhood sticker book . Sorry about the quality of the scans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly on the scanner . <p> As with many kids , my sticker book became a dumping ground for anything colorful that would stick to a page . So many awesome and obscure stuff at work here . . . Star Wars , A-Team , Gremlins , Michael Jackson , WWF stars , rockstars , M.u.s.c.l.e . characters , the list goes on . There 's a lot of hearts in there for some reason , I must have raided some leftover Valentines Day stickers : ) <p> This is n't art or inspiration by any means , but a pretty hilarious and adorable look back at the early to mid 1980s in sticker form . Enjoy . <p> PS . I went by Jimmy back then , hence the Jim stickers all over the place . <p> Here are a few images plucked from the blog of Lou Romano* , one of the head concept artists at the mighty Pixar . I managed to go see Up a few nights ago and , once again , Pixar managed to 1-up ( pun ! ) themselves again , following Wall-e with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the movies themselves , I 've always been blown away by the behind-the-scenes documentaries the Pixar folks put together showing the amount of conceptual that goes into everything they do . This is where Lou truly shines . He has a knack for creating extremely simplistic and colorful images that truly nail the scene at hand . After seeing Up then looking through his artwork , its truly incredible how the essence of his 2D concepts are carried through to the final 3D product . <p> If you have n't seen Up , I highly recommend it . You can also check out more of Lous work on his blog* . <p> *If you have n't seen the movie yet , be warned that some of Lous images might be scene spoilers . <p> I figured this wonderful painting warranted its own post , especially given all of the Star Trek hype surrounding the new movie these days .

Great stuff , especially that Hewlett-Packard ad with the multicolored computers ( or whatever they are ) floating off into space . <p> Ive been a big fan of Scott MacDonalds illustration style for quite some time . He lived here in Halifax a while back and currently resides in Vancouver . I really dig his character designs , which have a designer toy appeal yet somehow maintain a classic style from the golden days of animation . <p> But this post is dedicated to a wicked book Scott launched recently entitled Tyson 85 , using his unique style to chronicle Mike Tysons life during the year 1985 . He illustrates all 15 of Tysons opponents that year ( all of which were victories ) as well as a few other milestones . Fantastic idea , and check out those characters .

Considering the pair passed away in 1996 I have been having trouble finding any footage of them talking about their works and careers . <p> Some wonderful quotes in these short videos , especially Rand who disects what makes design function in the way it needs too . here 's a sample : <p> " Aesthetics is the study of art , or , the study of the interaction and fusion of form and content . Which means that the difference between aesthetics and art is that aesthetics is the study of art . Other then that , they are the same . " <p> Highly recommend taking a few minutes to watch these videos from these experienced and wise designers .

Montreal Meets will feature 2 hour-long presentations on creativity , inspiration , industry stuff and all kinds of fun stories geared toward artists and designers . I will be presenting , along with my good friend Fabio Sasso owner and operator of the best damn creative site on the web , Abduzeedo.com . Here is all the info : <p> When : Tuesday , January 25 , 2011Where : Concordia University , Montreal QuebecTime : 6:00pm , be there at least 30 minutes to be LONG ... <p> Fran+ois has talked about doing this kind of event for a little while now , and I 'm really excited to be a part of it . This is a perfect example of doing things yourself and achieving your goals , so let 's give a round of applause to Fran+ois Hoang for making it happen as well as the kind sponsorship of Go Media , Weapons of Mass Creation Fest and Delicate Machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concordia University for the big event . Let 's make this rock harder then the Beatles in a fight with the Stones . See you soon , Montreal ! <p> As the Hobo With a Shotgun boys are busy completing the movie in Toronto , they decided to launch my design for their production company called Yer Dead . We started talking about this logo about a year ago but we really started moving on it over the last few months as the film came closer to completion . I really enjoy working with Jason Eisener and Rob Cotterill because they have a really clear direction in their head , which mostly revolves around stuff they were into as kids . . . 80s action awesomeness . Which , as you can imagine , I 'm all about . <p> We went through a few designs before landing on this one , here are a couple : <p> The guys liked these initial concepts , but they were looking for something that , in their words " would look badass on a t-shirt " . Once I heard that it really set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this logo for my pals and I 'm stoked to see it on the big screen really soon . <p> If you missed tuning into Signalnoise Broadcast 35 last week , here is the recorded version for you to check out . This was a bit of a hilarious episode because I decided to dive into my old design work from school , way back in 95 . I have a big wooden crate full of old work so I decided to show some of that stuff in order to enforce the idea of " everyone needs to start somewhere " . The majority of the folks who visit my blog only know my new work , so here 's a chance to see some of my very first design projects and hear stories about my school days . <p> So , have a watch and I 'll see you in a few days for Signalnoise Broadcast 36 , this Thursday at 3pm EST . <p> That 's right , according to the United Nations 2011 is the International Year of Forests , to raise awareness on sustainable management , conservation and sustainable development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to be discussed and supported the world over , as without our green friends there would be no us . <p> This is n't an official poster , just something I created to lend my support to the event . I certainly hope they do n't  mind my using their logo . I kept it simple and used the Canadian maple leaf off our flag as the repeated symbol to populate the tree in an attempt to keep it homegrown . Ugh , puns . The bulk of the work on this poster was copying and pasting all of those leaves , and adjusting them to the proper scale and angle . Tedious stuff , I think I may need glasses now . <p> I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for a wonderful 2010 . The support you have shown me and the blog through comments , tweets , emails and tuning into the weekly Signalnoise Broadcasts has been tremendous and overwhelming . Thank-you so much , let 's make 2011 an inspiring and creative year all around . <p> For this design I wanted to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my childhood . Something fun , cool and over the top . This hearkens back to the likes of Mad Max , where anti-heroes rule the desolate highways . In this case , a leather-clad motorcycle warrior with chains and hooks as his weapons of choice . All of the credits are phony , I assure you Jason Eisener and his film company are n't  making this one . : ) <p> After posting about the Black Swan posters recently , here is a great poster for yet another Natalie Portman film , The Other Woman . After riffing on lame movie posters for a while I 'm feeling the need to call attention to the nice posters when they appear , such as this one . Great use of tone , typography , wonderful watercolor textures and I really enjoy the unfinished city in the background . Looks like this poster was ripped out of someones sketchbook , which is really cool . <p> Related to the previous post about the Black Swan posters , I 'd now like to feature the studio that created them , London UK-based La Boca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research to find out who designed those posters , but am very happy to have come across La Boca . <p> The images I plucked are primarily their CD work , full of vibrant colors and wonderful vintage illustration . I 've seen a few of these sporadically online over the past while , and its always nice to find the people responsible . While their overall designs may be simplistic , the troops over at La Boca use wonderful shading and texture work to add nice depth to their work . <p> The movie posters for Darren Aronofskys new film Black Swan have been a pretty impressive run . I came across the topmost posters a few months ago , struck by the classic sensibility of the colors and illustration . These posters emerged online when I had n't  a clue about the movie or what it was about , but it instantly had my attention . Even the new posters sporting Natalie Portmans face are done well , creating a sense of unease which I hear is a main theme of the film . <p> But let 's talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hollywood for consistently messing up modern movie posters and I 'd like to use Black Swan to support my argument . Marketing of films are angled toward whoever has the starring role , this is painfully obvious . But teaser posters are a different breed of marketing . As I said earlier , I was instantly intrigued by Black Swan upon seeing those teasers above , so much so that I kept it on my radar as the trailer was released and everything ramped up . That is exactly what a teaser poster should do , create interest . Those posters are beautiful , mysterious , atmospheric and above all , different ! <p> I 'm confident in saying that if those posters werent released I probably would n't have cared enough to watch for this movie . And I certainly would n't be writing this right now . <p> So Hollywood , please take a few notes from Aronofsky on this one . If you claim the official poster of whatever movie should have a big picture of Tom Cruises face , then fine . But why not explore alternative styles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of folks outside of the lead actors fanbase ? It worked in my case . 
@@121792163 @10792163/ <h> Signalnoise Green Lantern poster <p> Here it is , the Signalnoise version of a Green Lantern film poster . Its been my intention for a few months now to make a poster touting the upcoming Lantern movie , I even had the idea suggested to me by a few friends and folks online . So I grabbed a few hours over the last three days and dove into the creation of this Green Lantern poster . 100% fan-based , not official at all . <p> I created this poster because back in 1983 when me and the other neighborhood kids decided to play Superfriends , my choice character was always the Green Lantern while they were fighting over who got to play Batman . I had some hand-me-down comics that featured the Lantern and I always thought he had the coolest power , manifesting whatever he could think of in any situation . Plus , that ring was by far the coolest accessory and I even went as far as to make my own little paper rings complete with the Green Lantern logo crudely drawn on . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this design is obviously not the Ryan Reynolds version . They modernized his costume for the film with neat effects and all that which I 'm sure will look cool onscreen , but my Lantern is the classic Hal Jordan version with the nicely designed black and green cloth and white gloves . Here is the Superpowers toy version circa 1984 as well as an Alex Ross Green Lantern . <p> I honestly believe the Green Lantern logo in terms of design is ranked at third across the entire DC Universe trumped only by Superman and Batman , and the ring is by far the most iconic element of this hero . Which is why I was baffled when this poster was released and the ring is nowhere to be found . Say what ? <p> This was a convoluted process making this poster and involved some photography , a lot of vector work then a lot of Photoshop effects and texturing . I wanted it to look like an illustration but have the depth of a photograph . Ill be writing a making of poster hopefully for launch Monday to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind this Green Lantern poster . Stay tuned for that one . <p> Puddy , I really appreciate the heads up on the error . I had to look up the saying last night as I could n't remember if it was darkest or blackest . Found 2 sites that gave me the wrong information . : ) Thanks man . <p> Love it ! I was excited when you mentioned it yesterday in the Signalnoise Broadcast . I came here first thing this morning to see if you finished it . Very cool ! Great idea of using your fist , man ! Not only does it mean you do n't  have to decide on which face to use , but it also highlights the ring . Love it . <p> As noted earlier , I said that you inspired me to make a Flash poster design , I just finished it yesterday and I thought that I would post it here . I used some techniques that you showed us in your Live Broadcast when you broke down your Tron poster .

I originally planned on printing all of my work to canvas when I started on it , but decided to keep things simple and stick with paper until I knew more about the process . Sounds like your experience went really well , though , so I may revisit it . Great looking show . <p> Matt and Peter , thanks so much guys .

The trailer is packed with lovely neon lights and television screen feedback , which are elements I love incorporating into my work . <p> This is n't official by any means , but it would certainly be a dream job to design a poster for the film , especially since they slated the mighty Daft Punk to create the score .

The concept came straight from Sam at Revolve and was something I was real excited about right out of the gate . It needed to be easily recognizable , fun and unique . Given our proximity to the ocean , I knew there was no better element to represent our part of Canada . I wanted waves , flow , a real " liquid landscape " . <p> After I got the colours and form in place , it was then a matter of populating our invented landscape with people , animals , trees , buildings , vehicles and whatever else to represent our part of the country along with the sections of the newspaper .

Aw well , one of those things . <p> I love designing icons , always have . Back when I worked in the web industry designing sites ( 1998 2010 ) I often found myself designing custom icons of all kinds depending on the style and function of the site at hand . I always looked forward to taking a specific topic and whipping up a simple little illustration that symbolized it .

I teamed up with my friends at Revolve on this one , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the art direction and selecting those great colours you see above . The group at the top was my personal cut list as I felt those icons depicted best the sections at hand , while the others were different variations and choices I developed along the way . <p> These icons were part of a much larger project for the Herald , and- unfortunately- the vast majority of these little guys did n't  make it into the final product . It happens , things get cut . BUT , I was so damn proud of these suckers that I had to post them . Like I said , I enjoy- designing- icons and I rarely get to do it these days .

And who better than the Omega Force ? <p> I 'm extremely proud to show the work Ive been doing for UbiSoft in support of their upcoming release , FAR CRY 3 : BLOOD DRAGON . Me and the team at UbiSoft have been carving this stuff out for the past 8 months or so and having a great time the entire way . The game is super 80s movie inspired , stealing cues from genre action films and VHS culture , so as you can imagine I was ALL OVER this thing .

I pulled out the Struzan-inspired techniques and got to it . <p> I should also point out , that 's one of my favorite action stars in there , Michael Biehn .

Were real proud of that CBC logo , one of the best in the world . <p> In a nutshell , the RIT Graphic Design Archive states " Burton Kramer ( 1932- ) is a graphic designer who trained in the United States , pursued an influential career in Zurich , and then moved to Toronto , where he revitalized the design community with bold interpretations of the Swiss and International styles of typography and image . " That really sums it up . The guy learned from sources where it counts , then brought it to my country . His reach is long and he created the Canadian design culture for an entire era .

Sure , I liked Woods painting style at the time , the way he illustrated cool robots and good lookin ladies . But it did n't  stop there .

I browsed his website all the time and finally came across the name of the person responsible for all that cool design . This guy named Tom Muller . <p> Over the years I 've frequented Toms website , Hellomuller , to see what he s been up to . He never ceases to amaze with precision type and identities , excellent book cover design and all the other stuff he s done .

Sorry Tom , I had to cut off your awesome Coenfographic . That thing would have crippled my blog ! <p> I have some vivid memories of random computer books kicking around the local library around the time I was in High School . Most of them were about a decade old at that time , dating back to the early 80s . Many were obsolete , but for some reason they were all readily available to loan out , whereas more relevant material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer nerds had donated these books to the library the minute they became useless to them . I also recall thinking how strange it was that these books looked both old and new to me at the same time . <p> There seemed to be no hard rules when it came to creating cover art for these kind of books : computer generated images , drawings , paintings , photographythey were all in play . <p> Back then , I knew nothing about computers at all , but the covers of these books always piqued my curiosity . Some were awesome , some were pretty awful , but they all rocked an 80s vibe . The personal computer boom of the 80s led to an enormous amount of published material on everything from basic learning to programming languages . The internet had n't  even been invented yet , but there was a sense of " living in the future " that created a kind of innocent excitement I cant quite explain . <p> Here are some shots from my Back to the Future talk last week , presented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and the venue at The Hub Halifax was an excellent stage , packed the room but was still intimate .

Did n't  think so . Even if you grew up in the 80s there 's a pretty good chance you missed out on these radical robots . Ideal Toys debuted them at the 1984 Toy Fair ; unwittingly pitting them head-to-head with the Gobots and the Transformers , both of which apparently caught the company by surprise . Without the power to transform and very limited poseability , Robo Force simply could n't compete with rival toy lines .

They really went all out , unfortunately it just was n't enough to overcome the toys inherent shortcomings . <p> My brother and I had a few of these , he started out with the mighty leader Maxx Steele while I went for his evil counterpart , Hun-dred . My fondest memories of these toys was in the early summer of 1984 when we left Western New York to live in sunny Florida . My parents packed us up in the Chevy Monte Carlo and we were off on a three day journey to parts unknown . Keeping my brother and I company in the back seat were our Robo Force guys , mini command centers my dad carved out of solid styrofoam , and a cooler full of Dr Pepper . To this day , with the potent combination of indestructible robots ( these things were built like tanks ) , squeaky breaking styrofoam , and a seemingly endless supply of caffeine , I have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had settled in Orlando , Transformers had taken over our robot play time and good ol Maxx and Hun-dred were relegated to the dustbin .

Beware , you 're eyeballs will be fried . <p> If you 've been following me on Twitter you would have probably seen me bitching about code over the past little while , and here is why . I 'm happy to announce that the new version of Signalnoise.com is now live , and you 're looking at it right now . <p> I 'm a real bugger when it comes to my own website . Instead of trying to add a bunch of new features and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things out of the design as possible . The previous version of Signalnoise was super streamlined as I really do n't  want unnecessary clutter all over the place . Content is king around here and I intend to keep it that way . I 'm also the kind of guy who gets set in his ways , so the design and palette for this new version greatly resembles the previous mostly so I do n't  have to get used to some new crazy thing . Its like my old website decided to go to the gym . <p> Also , I 've installed the WPTouch plugin , so Signalnoise is now optimized for viewing on your iPhone . <p> The previous website took me about 3 months of tinkering before it was complete , and I 've realized the only way to sufficiently iron out all the wrinkles is to get the site online so we can use it to its full extent . I know there are already a few little things that need my attention in the design so if you see any weirdness over the next few days , I assure you I 'm on it .

@@121792198 @10792198/ <h> Inspiration : Bookman Swash <p> Many designers become quite monogamus when choosing the typefaces to use in their works , and I 'm no different . This inspirational post is dedicated to one of my favorite typefaces , the mighty Bookman Swash . I decided to write a post featuring this typeface as I 've had many people asking me about the type treatments on my posters , which is a mix of Bookman Regular and Bookman Swash . <p> This typeface quickly became one of my favorites after seeing it prevalent on a book featuring advertising in the 1970s . Bookman Swash was littered throughout the book , obviously one of the most beloved typefaces of designers in that era . <p> So , for all the type nerds out there , here is a bit of interesting information on this beautiful typeface brought to you by Wikipedia : <p> About Bookman <p> Bookman Old Style is a typeface derived from Old Style Antique designed by Alexander Phemister in 1858 for Miller and Richard foundry . Several American foundries copied the design , including the Bruce Type Foundry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce refitted their design , made a few other improvements , and rechristened it Bartlett Oldstyle . When Bruce was taken over by ATF shortly thereafter , they changed the name to Bookman Oldstyle . <p> Bookman was designed as an alternative to Caslon , with straighter serifs , making it more suitable for book and display applications . It maintains its legibility at small sizes , and can be used successfully for headlines and in advertising . In 1936 , Chauncey H. Griffith of the American Linotype foundry developed a revival . <p> About Bookman ITC <p> ITC Bookman is a revival designed by Ed Benguiat in 1975 , for the International Typeface Corporation . Benguiat developed a full family of four weights plus complementary cursive designs . Benguiat also drew a suite of swash and alternate characters for each of the members of the family . This version adds a large x-height and moderate stroke contrast to improve legibility . <p> Fonts for swash and alternate characters were eventually released in OpenType versions of the fonts , or separately as ITC Bookman Swash . <p> " monogamus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for acting as grammar police .

I am always trying to move away from it , but often feel powerless to resist it . Sort of like my ex-girlfriend only her alternate characters are n't  nearly as enjoyable . ; - ) <p> I love Bookman Swash . Its surprising though , because 95% of my favorite fonts are sans-serif . Yes , it was overused , but its got some kind of " lifestyle " cachet to it that makes me believe all sunsets are deep orange . <p> By the way , does anyone know where I can get Bookman Swash ?

@@121792199 @10792199/ <p> Since I launched the Signalnoise t-shirt line 3 weeks ago I have been getting no shortage of tweets , emails and comments in support of the designs and the new venture as a whole . The reaction from the creative community has been overwhelming , and very unexpected . I was caught quite offguard by the amount of t-shirt orders I received on the launch day and spent the past 2 weeks sitting at my coffee table folding and packing t-shirts to ship out . <p> Another surprise was what design customers were interested in . I spent a great deal of time creating original works for print on my t-shirts , but the biggest seller turned out to be the Signalnoise logo shirt . Im humbled by the idea that so many want to wear my little rainbow sun on their chest , and for that I would like to send out a sincere thank-you to everyone who ordered shirts and took the time to send me encouraging notes and comments . This has been a wonderful experience thus far . <p> That being said , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and have sent 3 to print yesterday as well as a re-print of my Signalnoise logo shirt .

You will see a few little changes to the site over the next little while . <p> Thanks again , everyone ! I 'm working hard to bring more designs to this growing project . Stay tuned ! <p> Here are a few preview images of the upcoming Signalnoise t-shirt releases , dropping in August . The response to the launch of the t-shirt line has been nothing less then overwhelming so I immediately started on the designs for the next installment .

I never expected to have so many orders to send so quickly , which is a good problem to have . : ) However , all orders are being taken care of as quickly as possible and I appreciate your patience as I get your wares to you . <p> Thanks so much for the continued support , everyone ! You really turned this new Signalnoise venture into a super fun ordeal . <p> The night before the online launch , I decided to have a " Presale for Pals " at my condo . I invited over some good friends who have been supporting me all this time to have a first look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a great time and I managed to get some shirts to some happy folks .

Thanks man ! <p> I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Signalnoise line of designer t-shirts , now available for purchase in the Signalnoise Store . This project has been many years in the making , and I 'm really excited to offer some new , fun apparel . <h> The Story <p> Ive been a designer for my entire adult life from 1998 to 2010 , working at a variety of local agencies here in Halifax as well as working on a freelance basis for many big international clients . For the duration of that time I have never stopped working on personal projects on my own time , continuing to push forward with my personal skills and ambitions as an independent artist . One of the dreams I 've had since my teens is designing my own line of cool and fun t-shirts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for talk was over . I quit my full-time design job to properly invest my own time and money into the Signalnoise line of designer t-shirts , which I am excited to unveil today . I wanted to do everything my own way in order to keep that same level of excitement I had back in my teens when I started thinking about my own t-shirts . The shirts are sketched , designed , printed , packed and shipped right here in Halifax , Nova Scotia with no investors , business loans or start-up cash . 100% of the investment is my own , and inspired by guys like Scott Hansen , Johnny Cupcakes and Joshua Smith who are rockin it independently . This is grassroots , man . Right where I want to be . <p> This project has also brought me back to illustration , something I 've been doing since the age of 4 but was replaced in recent years by the computer . I 'm happy to be taking Signalnoise into a new direction that brings me back to where I started , with a pencil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wont be stealing moms good typewriter paper . : ) <p> On top of that , I took great care in creating the supporting materials to promote my t-shirt line , including the packaging , freebies , look book , photography and the commercial you see above . I saw the commercial as a challenge because I 've never created one before , so I wrote , designed and edited the whole thing just to see if I could do it . And with the help of a few friends the whole thing came together in a hilarious way . Huge thanks to Nick Campbell for creating the awesome 3D Signalnoise intro sequence , Chris Toms for shooting all the video and photographs , and Lucas Gardiner for creating the excellent music track . You guys rule . <h> About the Shirts <p> All of the Signalnoise t-shirts are printed right here in Halifax , Nova Scotia . I even had to haul all the boxes back here myself . All are silk-screened on Gildan 2000 t-shirts : 100% Cotton preshrunk , double needle top-stitched neckline , double stitched sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulders . <p> These 4 designs are currently available in S , M , L , XL and XXL on unisex t-shirts . I will be offering ladies cuts in the near future as I expand , but for now I only have unisex versions of the designs . All t-shirt orders are shipped in a quality , black zip-locked bag to protect from moisture , along with a free swag bag which contains Signalnoise stickers , buttons and other little fun items as a way of saying thanks for your support . <p> This first run is fairly limited , so if you are looking at grabbing one of the kick-off Signalnoise shirts you might want to hurry in case they go fast ! Ordering begins today for this first run and shipping will begin next week . <h> In Conclusion <p> Will this Signalnoise t-shirt line be a successful endeavor ? Well , this is a gamble on my part so only time will tell . But I can promise you I will be working as hard as I can to bring new and fun ideas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotional side . This has been a dream of mine for quite some time , so its time to put the pedal to the metal . <p> Thanks so much everyone for the constant support and encouragement . Whether you went out of your way to send me an email or throw a note via Twitter , your support and kind words are extremely inspiring and I appreciate each and every one . Its easy to stay motivated when you have such wonderful people egging you on , you guys are awesome . <p> So , swing on over to the Signalnoise Store to check out the new Signalnoise t-shirts ! <p> Here is a silly outtake from the t-shirt shoot we did at Strange Adventures comic shop yesterday evening . Chris Toms brought his camera for some photos of the shirts , his wife Sameen shot a bit of behind the scenes video and my good buddy Cal ( owner of the comic shop ) was gracious enough to help us out with lighting and setting things up . Thanks so much , gang ! <p> Today is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the loose ends for the shirt launch tomorrow , including supporting collateral , writing for the blog and store , additional graphics and promo items and a bunch more stuff .

Tomorrow is a big day , time to get rockin . <p> If you tuned into Signalnoise Broadcast 12 last week , you will have gotten a sneak peek at my new personal project . Coming very soon to the Signalnoise Store will be my first line of designer t-shirts , consisting of 4 designs to start . This new Signalnoise venture is self-initiated and the production is footed by me alone , no investors or loans . More details will be coming over the next week or so . <p> That being said , I wanted to talk a bit about this preview image . I 've worked a lot with wonderful companies and brands throughout the years creating collateral and promotional materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting materials for my brand I thought it would be fun to think along the same lines as those clients . In the case of this preview image , I wanted something that might look appropriate in a fashion magazine , adding a bit of rock n roll yet reference the Signalnoise history of work . <p> The base image was kindly supplied by the folks at Thinkstock , and I proceeded to spend many hours changing the elements and adding my own work . I thought it would be funny to see my posters littered about an alley like they were unwanted advertisements . <p> In short , you do n't  need to be a big client in order to make your brand strong and your ideas a reality . Treat your stuff like their stuff . Stay tuned for more details as I ramp up the Signalnoise t-shirt launch ! <p> If you follow me on Twitter , you might have noticed me mention Brass Tack Apparel a few times .

Its best said in his own words : <p> " Brass Tack is a Orlando based concept from the mastermind Hydro74 . The idea is to promote the art and iconic production of symbolic relevance with intellectual idealism founded on a secret society level . The Brass Tack clothing line is dedicated to lush quality , simply stated themes , unique imagery that centers around graphical interpretations of the lost art of underground secret social systems that hide their ideology in plain sight . The core concept in the end is never to establish , but in the end , it has always been there or lived in some form or another .

Good ideas . <p> I posted a couple of split images to show what my illustrations were based on . I wanted the Darkseid illustration to directly reference a drawing by creator Jack Kirby because I did n't  want some bullcrap " modernized " version of the character . Same with Mega Man .

@@121792202 @10792202/ <h> Escape <p> here 's a fun one . I recently participated in my first actual collaboration with my friend and awesome person Kat Gaskin over at Salty Pineapple . Ive been enjoying her work for some time now , with her lovely bleached beach scenes , palm trees and muted tones . I cant remember who suggested it first , but a collaboration would be fun and challenging since our styles are so wildly different . Her desaturated tones with my dumb loud colours ? Yikes . <p> After we threw a PSD file back and forth , the above image emerged . Kind of a perfect mix of our preferred styles . Very Miami Vice . Super fun . <h> 2 Comments <p> Hi James . I love your escape design . I am in a rock duo that plays mostly 80s covers in Melbourne , Australia . Our name is Escape and I have found it difficult to find a better design on the web or have someone create something that suits us better than your Design . I am sure it has a copyright on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing us approval to use this design as our duo logo / image ? Look forward to hearing from you . 
@@121792203 @10792203/ <p> After a long 2-week marathon working on- completing- my latest movie poster ( TBA ) , I decided to take a day off and work on a fun little character portrait just for practise . I 've always wanted to do a design based on my favourite swashbuckin starship captain , so now was the time . What started as a fun little illustration grew into my newest poster : THE SMUGGLER . This one is kind of inspired by posters and portraits from the old west <p> This was created using only 3 colours in hopes of someday doing a screenprint , but in all honesty I do n't  know what the final destination of my Solo design will be given how massive the STAR WARS franchise is . Maybe I can do a limited run if I get some okay buzz and demand for this one . Not really sure , guess well see . <p> " Uh , we had a slight weapons malfunction , but uh everythings perfectly all right now . Were fine . Were all fine here now , thank you . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a couple of colour variants , added them above . <p> Here is my poster for one of my favorite movies of all time , FIRST BLOOD , celebrating its 30th anniversary . Yep , this beast of a film was released back in 82 when I was 5 years old . After doing the DRIVE poster late last year I knew for my next work I wanted to dive into the past a create something I loved as a kid . When- Mystery Box asked me what film I wanted to create a poster for , this was my first pick . They worked their magic , and were just waiting on a bit of red tape . <p> I was n't allowed to see FIRST BLOOD when I was a little kid . My parents said it was too violent so they would never rent the VHS for me , but I always caught little snippets of it when I was over at friends places . This , of course , made the movie even cooler because it was outlawed in our house . Something dangerous . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom ordering me the Rambo toy knife kit out of a comic book , and I got the Rambo figure for Christmas in 86 . That rocket-launcher was awesome . <p> So to me ( probably because of the rubber toy version ) , Rambos knife was one of the main characters of the film . He s typically depicted with a big gun of some sort , but I knew for my poster I wanted that knife front and center . My favorite parts of FIRST BLOOD take place out in the woods as he s beating up cops and the local makeshift army . Very natural scenery , with a Canadian tie as it was shot outside of Vancouver in a town called Hope . Other than- sporadic- outbursts , Sylvester Stallones character is relatively calm and determined during the movie . You never knew when he was about to cut loose . I wanted that reflected in my design rather than an action scene . Had to be about the character . <p> I did quite a few sketches , trying to dial in on the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include . I then scoured the movie for some reference shots I could use before starting up the digital paints . Found the shot I wanted to work with and started some studies and final build . The original version had very different colours , but I switched to a palette that reflected those forest scenes I love so much . here 's a few process shots . <p> And a close-up of the final to show a bit of the painterly detail . <p> This is my second movie poster completed to this extent . As some of you know I did my first poster drop a week and a half ago for DRIVE and it was- turbulent- at best . I hit snags at just about every step and lost quite a lot of sleep as I tried to smooth out the- speed-bumps- I encountered along the way . I took some knocks , but learned some valuable lessons and tips along with some very helpful information . I owe a huge thank-you to the kind people at Expresso Beans who reached out to me and lent a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who you are , and I really appreciate it . <p> So , what will be different ? My representation Mystery Box has been hard at work to set up a system to get my ( and other artists they represent ) posters produced , sold and shipped . First and foremost , we will be working with the mighty D&amp;L Screenprinting in Seattle , a reputable company who does tremendous screenprint work . The FIRST BLOOD poster was designed specifically with screenprinting in mind and I 'm excited to move into this new territory . 24 ? x 36 ? , thick paper- with a vicious colour variant . Mystery Box has also set up its own storefront coupled with a fulfillment company . This will be the platform where my posters will be sold , along with other Mystery Box artists . <p> We will be moving into production next week , and once we are further along I will have the onsale information to post. - As always with these things , its best to follow me on Twitter to get details quick . <p> I 'm busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 'm going to post to the blog on Thursday . Like , tomorrow . This is a real exciting , and I 'm still dazed that Ollie over at Mystery Box worked his magic . One of my favorite movies of all time . Shaking just thinking about it . <p> Ill be writing some of the details , stories and motivations behind this one tomorrow . I 've learned a lot about the alternative poster community over the past week and this poster will bring about a very different method of doing things around Signalnoise . The release will be handled differently , and I 'll outline some of those details tomorrow . This is the design launch , onsale info will be posted once we move more deeply into production . <p> The Heidelberg tried to literally define " hot pink " with this small mishap . <p> Here is a little video I cut together after visiting Bounty Print- this morning to sign-off on my DRIVE poster . They fired up the Heidelberg press when I was there so I shot a bit of footage . Amazing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is bigger than my house . <p> The DRIVE poster launches on January 19 , one week from today . Details here . <p> At the last minute I was offered a ticket to see Prince perform live in Halifax . Most of my friends were already going and I was on the fence long enough to assume I would n't be going . Really happy that was n't the case . I 'm familiar with some of Princes material , but not nearly enough as I should be . I do like how Prince goes about his work very differently then other musicians , really cares about his craft and it shows . And for what its worth , I always liked that symbol of his great ideas wrapped in there . <p> His show last night was one of the best I 'd ever seen . He makes the standard stage/audience set-up look really lazy . He and his performers danced around his giant logo , lights galore . Amazing spectacle to see . I snapped the photo seen above during the show ( which I was n't allowed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right when that orange spotlight hit me . Liked it so much , I aped the colours to make a Prince design , seen above . <p> Instructions are simple .

A contest even . Colour up the Jay and Silent Bob page , scan it in , - post it online and drop a link in the comments below. - The only rule is NO COMPUTERS . If I smell a hint of Photoshop , instant disqualification . I want this thing coloured old school crayons , coloured pencils , watercolours , anything that does n't  include Photoshop . Get wild .

Being that we are a small city , this event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the big man show up , tell stories and have some laughs . It was a great evening , and Kevin said that he would be back " real soon " with some friends in tow . <p> Not only did he keep his word , but he is coming back just over a month later with Jason Mewes for his Jay and Silent Bob Get Old Canadian tour . Needless to say , I snapped up my tickets real quick and am stoked to see Kevin speak once again . <p> He put out on his Twitter a little while ago that he was looking for a Canadian artist to design the tour poster . Being a long time fan of the guy , I had to give it a shot . That 's my poster above . Me and my pal Jerko used to watch the hell out of the CLERKS Animated Series back in the day , and I always liked the character designs from the show . My Jay and Bob are influenced by that style , with my own interpretation thrown into the mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped into Illustrator . As you can tell by the characters , the original concept was more " badass " . <p> Hey Atlantic Canada ! Ill be doing a signing this Saturday at Hal-Con 2011 , Sci-Fi Fantasy and Comic Convention . In order to make this event special , I did a small 11 x 17 run of rare Signalnoise posters relating to movies and comics . All of the posters seen above will be available at the signing for a low $10 each , or 2 for $15 . Ill sign it up right there , and throw in some Signalnoise stickers and buttons . <p> None of these posters were previously available , and most will not be available again . Like I said , super low print run . You have to swing by the signing area at Hal-Con to scoop these . Ill be signing 2pm to 3pm on Saturday afternoon but be sure to get there early in case these get snapped up quick . <p> A big thanks to my pal Cal over at the best comic shop in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking of , he will be running Cal-Con at the shop this weekend where he s running all kinds of specials and cool events .

@@121792205 @10792205/ <p> For those who were unable to tune in live yesterday for SNBC:53 , here is the recorded version for you to check out . I might have been a bit sick yesterday but I missed the previous weeks broadcast because I was traveling . So here we go . <p> I did n't  have a topic once again , just a general question and answer period where we covered topics such as the Signalnoise Store and new products , video game box art , designing with a grid , designing the " bullseye " , the idea of timeless design , changing your artistic style , and a bunch of other fun subjects . <p> So have a watch , and I will see you at the regular time next week , Thursday at 3pm EST . <p> When I first started kindergarten back in 1981 my parents bought me my first lunchbox , good ol Buck Rogers . But since the show was on TV in the late 70s I was too young to even know anything about pop culture . I had no idea who Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me about the show . But here is where blind kid-like enthusiasm comes in . The lunchbox had a dude aiming a laser gun , hot girl , a robot , a spaceship and a real cool logo everything a kid needs . Seeing the show was irrelevant , I still knew I had the coolest lunch in the class . <p> The round , cut-out portrait of Buck still makes me laugh . Maybe Gil Gerard had it written into his contract that all merchandise needed his headshot included . So good . <p> Mom packed my sandwich and juice in this thing everyday . I can still remember the sound that latch made when you closed it up and the rattle of the handle when I carried it to school . Good times . <p> And its sure no mystery where I get my inspiration from these days . This lunchbox has all the elements I love ( and mimic ) today . This shots were borrowed from this Vintage Tin LunchboxesFlickr set . <p> I watched an excellent documentary a few nights ago called American Grindhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States , starting with its roots back in the 1930s . They showed all the important and influential films from the scene complete with footage and a lot of posters . <p> A big part of the film was the Blaxploitation sub-genre that erupted in the 1970s . Ive been a big fan of these films for quite some time , primarily for their over the top dialogue , action scenes and plot lines . But it was pretty clear while watching American Grindhouse that Blaxploitation films had the best , and most badass posters by far . I decided to round up some of my favorites . Typically showcasing the stars and scenes on a white background , each poster has their own unique characteristics . I simply love the arrangements and killer title treatments , just look at that Super Fly T.N.T . poster . Lighting his smoke with lit dynamite ? ! So good . <p> All of these were yanked from the mighty The Wrong Side of Art , which I highly recommend having a look through if you have 8 hours to spare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Dig It ? . Perfect soundtrack . <p> The past couple of months have been a bit of a blur with traveling , speaking , teaching , shipping , blogging , emailing , working and all of the other things that make up the day of a 1-man design company . Its difficult at times to keep up with everything when stuff gets busy , as I 'm sure many of you know with your multi-faceted careers . Its not just about making stuff , but everything else involved with keeping things going . Which brings me to the purpose of this post . <p> Signalnoise as an online entity has grown far beyond my expectations over the past few years , building a mighty little readership that I appreciate each and every day . The people who take the time to drop by and leave a few words through whatever means they do truly mean a lot to me , you have no idea . So here are a few words to you hardcores : <p> Commenters You guys are the best , man . I really appreciate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to the blog every single day . When I started this thing I never expected to see the same names pop up all the time , but here we are . Its like having a friend drop in to visit for a few minutes . I may not have the chance to reply to everything said , but I guarantee I read every word you guys write . Big , big thanks to everyone who contributes around here . <p> Purchasers When I started the online store to sell my goods , I never expected people to buy them . For real , not just saying that . I made things that I liked , not things that I hoped others would like . But over the years Ive seen a steady increase in the amount of posters and t-shirts sold through my little store , and you have no idea how proud I am to see people wearing my logo on their chest . Never thought I 'd see the day , man . Mega thanks to everyone who took it upon themselves to support the Signalnoise brand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNBC broadcasts every single week because it gives me the opportunity to hang out with good friends for an hour and talk about art . That means a lot to me since Halifax offers limited events when it comes to that kind of thing . Each week I have about 100 viewers who show up to hang , offering amazing dialogue and funny banter . I maintain , you are the ones who make those broadcasts fun . Thanks so much for showing up , gang . <p> Speaking event attendees Now were getting down to it , the folks who actually travel and pay money to attend design events AND sit down for an hour to see me speak . I really enjoy getting onstage and telling the story of my work , but the fact that people are interested really does mean a lot .

When I 'm looking for feedback , help , advice , jokes or just keeping track of what others are up to , its become an essential . Most days I work from home by myself in the office , and you tweet-heads make it feel like you 're all here causing a ruckus . High fives to you all . <p> In a nutshell , a HUGE thanks to all of you who have supported and are continuing to support this little part of the web . Never could have done this without you . <p> Here is the recorded version of SNBC:52 , which was a big FITC Toronto 2011 wrap-up .

No topic-based discussion this week , just a general question and answer session . We covered subjects such as starting your own online store , logo design process , staying focused on client work while having your personal work on the go , the cost of software , the power of sketching , etc .

Ill also be bringing some Hobo With a Shotgun posters to get them into some hands . Updates during my trip might be a bit slow , but I 'll be sending updates and news out via my Twitter as I go from talk to talk , event to event . <p> The Cars franchise is the only work by Pixar I never got into , probably because it was created for kids who are into racing culture . Not really my thing . But I have to give some props to these vintage-style posters created to promote the upcoming Cars 2 film . I especially like the James Bond looking one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the recorded version of SNBC:50 , a big show ! This show was live last Wednesday , as opposed to my normal timeslot of Thursday . The reason for that is because April 20th was the 12th birthday of Signalnoise.com . I registered the Signalnoise domain name back in 1999 when I started my career in the web field . Its been a wild ride over the last 12 years , so what I decided to do for this show was to tell the story of the website . When it started , why it started , what it was used for at various points in my career , how it changed , etc . <p> Not many questions were answered , just a sprawling story . The reason for this was simple : I get a lot of questions about my past experience and education and I thought it would be nice to have the full story all in one place for those interested . I had a great time doing this one , and totally needed a nap afterward . And as a capper , my pal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hilarious . <p> Big thanks to my pal Nick Campbell for the hand-off as part of the 3 Hours of Power . Always enjoy doing back-to-back shows for a larger block of creative talk . Thanks Nick ! <p> Here is the recorded version of SNBC:49 for your viewing pleasure . Once again , we did n't  have any specific topic to discuss so we did a general Q&amp;A session and covered topics like my Year Zero type , copyrighting work , some of my personal projects , vector sketches , focusing on design interests , infographics , the weirdness of Illustrator , coping with design failures and lots of other fun topics . Have a watch . <p> Here is the recorded version of SNBC:48 which went live a few weeks back , if you missed out on tuning in at the time . There was n't any specific topic this time around , just a general Q&amp;A session with the viewers where we talked about SmartObjects , Dave McKean , focusing on your design interests , great inspiration websites , seeing art as a lifestyle , my favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bunch of other fun topics . <p> If you grew up in the 1980s then I 'm sure the work of american painter Drew Struzan was not far from sight . He started creating film posters around 1975 and worked very consistently throughout the 80s and 90s creating more the 150 posters during his career . He worked with many huge movie franchises creating a visual identity for the movies through his still images and compositions . Where would movies like Star Wars , Indiana Jones , Back to the Future and Big Trouble in Little China be without their iconic Struzan posters ? <p> Everyone I introduce Struzans work to eventually say the same thing : " He did THAT poster too ? ! " <p> I could go on and on about his work , but I wanted to make this post for a very specific and personal reason . I recently picked up his latest book , The Art of Drew Struzan from the kind folks at Strange Adventures and read it in one sitting . The book is packed with process sketches , previous versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s worked on , the crazy pitfalls that happened , and those special jobs where he collaborated with directors . As most artists trying to make a living in the creative realm , Drew is no stranger to client nightmares and the silliness of corporate Hollywood . The book is honest , Drew holds nothing back . <p> It might be odd of me to say that these stories ( both good and bad ) are inspiring , but there 's another level at work here . Most of the people who visit my blog are artists or designers , like me . Were doing our best to use our abilities to make nice things as best we can , and in order to do that and get paid we need to be hired . Sometimes that works out well , and sometimes it does n't  . Drew Struzan is in the same boat as the rest of us . Its easy to see his work and the people he s worked with and make assumptions involving thrones and riches , but he s a working man . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his story is remarkably down to earth . I approached Drew about doing an interview for the blog . He was understandably too busy , but I did receive a very nice email in return .

I was working at my first job at the time , Internet Solutions here in Halifax when the kind folks there helped me out in setting things up for the first time . I wanted my own little corner of the internet to upload my art and designs . At the time I had no idea what this would grow to be , but I 'm happy to say it still feels like that same little corner I was excited about back in 1999 . <p> Also by some twist of fate , today marks the 50th SNBC broadcast . Very strange how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNBC:50 a day earlier then usual and will be following my good pal Nick Campbell , going live once he finishes up his GSG Live Cast .

So much art and design , love it . All the info and times are on the graphic above . <p> For the next little while when you click on the Signalnoise Store button you will be getting a generic Maintenance Mode screen , and to clear up any concerns I thought I 'd let you know what was going on . <p> Over the past 3 years Ive seen my little store grow from a meager 5 launch posters to offer a wider range of designs and t-shirts . When I launched the store in February of 2008 I had no idea that it would have been as successful as it was , with a pretty consistent stream of orders coming in . I had lots of fun packing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping everything myself . If you ordered anything from my store over the last 3 years , it was packed by me on my dining table . No joke . <p> There was however an unfortunate side effect . As much as I liked doing all that packing and shipping , it took a lot of time away from what I truly love doing creating things . So I 'm at the point where something needs to change in order for me to get my creativity back on track . I 'm very lucky ( and proud ) to have the guys down at Merchline in my corner to handle all the fulfillment once the new store launches . Merchline is excellent and handles the products of a few of my favorite online shops such as ISO50 , Hydro74 and the Salvation Army WARdrobe . <p> I 'm sad to see my little Big Cartel store go . It was a real champ , and I still highly recommend their service if you want to start your own online store to sell your goods . No complaints , they kick ass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few weeks to get the Signalnoise Store set up at the new location . There are a few new designs and products in the works and will hopefully be available at launch . Stay tuned , I 'll keep you posted when things are ready to roll .

My presentation tends to change every time I speak , but I 'm always focused on personal creativity , self-initiated projects and telling stories along the way . <p> Big thanks to Vitamin T for the excellent job of putting this together . You guys make my bad jokes seem much more clever . Enjoy ! <p> When you read news stories like this and this , you strike while the iron is hot . We have Great Whites in Nova Scotia these days . Living on the east coast of Canada we very rarely hear anything shark-related , let alone the kings . Top of the food-chain .

I was heading over to the city to sit in a coffee shop to do some creating , and while on route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle over the desert " . That 's all I had , not even a sketch this time . <p> I got to the coffee shop and started layering textures and images in , just playing . Tried a whole bunch of stuff . At one point the triangle was a giant crystal with red and orange stripes . Over the next few hours I beat this piece into shape , loads of trial , error and fun along the way . I was listening to Scott Walker on my headphones the whole time , which might have brought some influence with it . <p> Over the last month or so Ive been messing with my own process in all kinds of ways . Really turning the knobs to challenge myself . I dove into this one head first and The Explorer emerged . <p> Here are my newest unofficial NASA mission patches , this time in support of the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope , a couple of the most important pieces of exploration equipment built . This brings my total number of mission patches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and what it has done in providing us with the best visualizations of distant nebulas and galaxies never before seen at this quality . The James Webb Space Telescope is said to be the " Hubble for the next generation " , due to launch in 2018 , - but is unfortunately fallen on hard times do to a massive budget slash . A very sad and important story , but you can find out how you can help right here . <p> Space is the place , man . So much we still do n't  understand . Expect more of these mission patches soon . <p> First thing this morning I followed a link dealt on Twitter by friend Tom Muller entitled You Are Not a Designer and I Am Not a Musician . I 'm not one for reading high-falootin articles labelling people this and that , but this article is very well written and got the gears turning . I enjoy articles like that . Interesting points , makes us question our progression and all that , something we should all do to keep things in perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out someones new design and caught a comment below : " This is great ! You should write a tutorial on how you did it . " Since the gears were already turning , this one little comment kind of hit home . Right time ? Wrong time ? Who knows , but here we are . <p> I got into using Photoshop and Illustrator way back in 95 when the internet was still getting its footing . Years before it would transform from something neat to something very useful . And certainly long before the rise of the tutorial . Back then we had nothing to go on , just the small classes on how to use the basics to create projects in school . Outside of that , thousands and thousands of hours noodling around . In order to achieve new things we had to figure it out . Just want to repeat that , we had to figure it out . <p> Most of what I know about Photoshop came from one of my favorite artists , Dave McKean . Back in 97 he and Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Dad for Two Goldfish . Beautiful book with brilliant artwork by McKean . I spent hundreds of hours pouring over the pages , closely inspecting his art and dissecting the layers of texture . Looking at the effects on his hand-drawn linework . Trying to discern what was paint , drawings , photography or scanned texture . Then jumping into Photoshop ( or my sketchbook ) to- figure it out . I failed miserably most times , but that was n't the point . I learned a huge amount about how Photoshop worked but more importantly , how I worked . <p> Fast-forward to now . We have a crazy amount of great tutorials online . Some of my best friends are tutorial wizards who have created a living doing so , such as Fabio Sasso and everyone at the Tuts+ Network . The most important reason I think these resources are valuable is because they teach people technique outside of base-level knowledge of graphic software . They show a concept , then how to make it . Awesome . I 'm a big advocate of helping people out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That comment I mentioned above , I 've been seeing that more and more these days and its concerning . When I read that today an immediate translation popped into my head : " I do n't  want to figure this out , so why do n't  you just tell me ? " That 's it , and that 's big . So many levels to that which cant possibly by contained in one blog post . <p> I learned skills from my time with Two Goldfish which I still use today . Heck , I used them in creating that graphic above . Ill probably use them forever . No step-by-step instructions , no downloadable pre-made assets . Just a kid with Photoshop and a lot of time on his hands . That 's what it comes down to . <p> So why on earth am I writing this ? Well , I 'm getting the impression that more and more people are becoming dependant on tutorials for what they make . That makes me sad because its the complete opposite of how I learned. - If you only do tutorials without exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : how to read . They 're a wonderful place to start , but its up to you after that . You should figure out how to do that thing you want to make instead of waiting for the tutorial to- emerge . What does Fabio do before he writes his great tutorials ? He figures it out . <p> When you figure things out for yourself it stays with you forever . Its a sense of pride and richness . Its an adventure . Its fun . Because of that , those 2 little goldfish are more valuable to me than all the tutorials in the world . <p> For those who missed it , here is the recorded version of SNBC:56 with a big recap of my trip to OFFF Barcelona 2011 . Had a great time with great people , so check it out . I also get into some of the ins and outs behind my recent Signalnoise identity refresh . Fun stuff , have a watch .

@@121792214 @10792214/ <p> After a long 2-week marathon working on- completing- my latest movie poster ( TBA ) , I decided to take a day off and work on a fun little character portrait just for practise . I 've always wanted to do a design based on my favourite swashbuckin starship captain , so now was the time . What started as a fun little illustration grew into my newest poster : THE SMUGGLER . This one is kind of inspired by posters and portraits from the old west <p> This was created using only 3 colours in hopes of someday doing a screenprint , but in all honesty I do n't  know what the final destination of my Solo design will be given how massive the STAR WARS franchise is . Maybe I can do a limited run if I get some okay buzz and demand for this one . Not really sure , guess well see . <p> " Uh , we had a slight weapons malfunction , but uh everythings perfectly all right now . Were fine . Were all fine here now , thank you . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a couple of colour variants , added them above . <p> Here is my poster for one of my favorite movies of all time , FIRST BLOOD , celebrating its 30th anniversary . Yep , this beast of a film was released back in 82 when I was 5 years old . After doing the DRIVE poster late last year I knew for my next work I wanted to dive into the past a create something I loved as a kid . When- Mystery Box asked me what film I wanted to create a poster for , this was my first pick . They worked their magic , and were just waiting on a bit of red tape . <p> I was n't allowed to see FIRST BLOOD when I was a little kid . My parents said it was too violent so they would never rent the VHS for me , but I always caught little snippets of it when I was over at friends places . This , of course , made the movie even cooler because it was outlawed in our house . Something dangerous . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom ordering me the Rambo toy knife kit out of a comic book , and I got the Rambo figure for Christmas in 86 . That rocket-launcher was awesome . <p> So to me ( probably because of the rubber toy version ) , Rambos knife was one of the main characters of the film . He s typically depicted with a big gun of some sort , but I knew for my poster I wanted that knife front and center . My favorite parts of FIRST BLOOD take place out in the woods as he s beating up cops and the local makeshift army . Very natural scenery , with a Canadian tie as it was shot outside of Vancouver in a town called Hope . Other than- sporadic- outbursts , Sylvester Stallones character is relatively calm and determined during the movie . You never knew when he was about to cut loose . I wanted that reflected in my design rather than an action scene . Had to be about the character . <p> I did quite a few sketches , trying to dial in on the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include . I then scoured the movie for some reference shots I could use before starting up the digital paints . Found the shot I wanted to work with and started some studies and final build . The original version had very different colours , but I switched to a palette that reflected those forest scenes I love so much . here 's a few process shots . <p> And a close-up of the final to show a bit of the painterly detail . <p> This is my second movie poster completed to this extent . As some of you know I did my first poster drop a week and a half ago for DRIVE and it was- turbulent- at best . I hit snags at just about every step and lost quite a lot of sleep as I tried to smooth out the- speed-bumps- I encountered along the way . I took some knocks , but learned some valuable lessons and tips along with some very helpful information . I owe a huge thank-you to the kind people at Expresso Beans who reached out to me and lent a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who you are , and I really appreciate it . <p> So , what will be different ? My representation Mystery Box has been hard at work to set up a system to get my ( and other artists they represent ) posters produced , sold and shipped . First and foremost , we will be working with the mighty D&amp;L Screenprinting in Seattle , a reputable company who does tremendous screenprint work . The FIRST BLOOD poster was designed specifically with screenprinting in mind and I 'm excited to move into this new territory . 24 ? x 36 ? , thick paper- with a vicious colour variant . Mystery Box has also set up its own storefront coupled with a fulfillment company . This will be the platform where my posters will be sold , along with other Mystery Box artists . <p> We will be moving into production next week , and once we are further along I will have the onsale information to post. - As always with these things , its best to follow me on Twitter to get details quick . <p> I 'm busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 'm going to post to the blog on Thursday . Like , tomorrow . This is a real exciting , and I 'm still dazed that Ollie over at Mystery Box worked his magic . One of my favorite movies of all time . Shaking just thinking about it . <p> Ill be writing some of the details , stories and motivations behind this one tomorrow . I 've learned a lot about the alternative poster community over the past week and this poster will bring about a very different method of doing things around Signalnoise . The release will be handled differently , and I 'll outline some of those details tomorrow . This is the design launch , onsale info will be posted once we move more deeply into production . <p> The Heidelberg tried to literally define " hot pink " with this small mishap . <p> Here is a little video I cut together after visiting Bounty Print- this morning to sign-off on my DRIVE poster . They fired up the Heidelberg press when I was there so I shot a bit of footage . Amazing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is bigger than my house . <p> The DRIVE poster launches on January 19 , one week from today . Details here . <p> At the last minute I was offered a ticket to see Prince perform live in Halifax . Most of my friends were already going and I was on the fence long enough to assume I would n't be going . Really happy that was n't the case . I 'm familiar with some of Princes material , but not nearly enough as I should be . I do like how Prince goes about his work very differently then other musicians , really cares about his craft and it shows . And for what its worth , I always liked that symbol of his great ideas wrapped in there . <p> His show last night was one of the best I 'd ever seen . He makes the standard stage/audience set-up look really lazy . He and his performers danced around his giant logo , lights galore . Amazing spectacle to see .

Needless to say , I snapped up my tickets real quick and am stoked to see Kevin speak once again . <p> He put out on his Twitter a little while ago that he was looking for a Canadian artist to design the tour poster .

@@121792230 @10792230/ <p> I started this design hot on the heels of- completing- the BLADE RUNNER poster . Im- continuously- learning new tricks and processes as I go , so I wanted to really dial in on the style I explored in BLADE RUNNER and simplify it . Really concentrate on the shapes that make up the- highlights- and shadows . The goal was to reduce the overall number of points , but really make them count . Smooth curves . <p> The over-arcing concept was to depict the alien taking human form , so I knew early on I needed some kind of weird abstract alien gore in there which- proved- to be the toughest challenge . I sought reference in the film , but I did n't  want hands , or tentacles , or a spider-head . I wanted a mess of scary " whatever " . I had to draw it all from the ground up ( pencil and paper , kids ) and on the third attempt it- finally- fell into place . From there it hit the scanner to be re-built in Illustrator . <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a hint of Photoshop in there . I see this and the BLADE RUNNER poster as kind of companion pieces since I did them both back to back with similar methodologies . <p> But again , it was all about atmosphere .

Great colour pallete with the alien gore red accent . This is the kind of poster that makes me want to watch a movie , not the same old recycled crap with Tom Cruise on it .

I want to do more of this kind of work after using this process for my Hobo With a Shotgun and Drive posters . I completed this in 58 minutes , - despite- being- interrupted- by a- phone call . Rock n roll . <p> I knew right away who I wanted to paint , the main character from my favourite movie. - Chief Martin- Brody from JAWS , played by the late Roy Scheider , based on a frame from the movie just after the sharks big reveal . <p> Here is a topic that has been spread throughout my broadcasts , posts and general creative process for most of my life and something I should have written a focused post on before now . So I want to take a few minutes and talk about something important to me based on my own experience and how I live my life . <p> The foundation for the Signalnoise platform was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurial escapade- or a project manager telling me what do do . I built everything on my own time , because I had to . Because its fun . What a lot of people do n't  know is that I worked as a website designer for about 12 years before making the leap to go full freelance only last year . While I was working at various agencies it was evenings , weekends and " sick days " that counted the most . If you look in my Gallery , 80% of that stuff is personal work . <p> I would work 9 to 5 , run home to grab some dinner , then work until 2am on the many personal projects I had on the go . I never stopped , and there were huge stints where my friends would n't see me because I was at home drawing , or animating in Flash , or creating a series of art pieces in Photoshop , or redesigning my website , etc . To me , the stuff I was doing during evenings was n't " work " , it was stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . I loved doing it it was a lifestyle , not a hobby . <p> Weekends were the same , only then I could spend a huge chunk of daytime hours plugging away on those personal projects . There really is nothing better than a rainy Sunday and a clean schedule . I would set my alarm real early to get a jump on that prime real estate . I 'd plop in front of the computer or drawing table with a nice coffee and that would be my day . <p> " Sick days " are in quotes because well , maybe once or twice I called in sick to work in order to stay home and work on my stuff . Your place is never quieter than when people think you 're sick . But that 's bad advice , do n't  do that . <p> We live in a world of constant distraction . I 'm not talking about the day job , I 'm talking about everything else that eats away the hours so you constantly hear people saying " I wish I had more free time " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . - In my experience , that is n't caused by a lack of free time , its because that time is eaten up by social stuff , television , video games , general goofin off , whatever else . Using your free time wisely is a choice , not something you hope happens on its own. - Signalnoise would not exist if I did n't  pour those hours into it . I had to . I read about all those classical artists from back in the 16th century or whatever creating because they were compelled to create . I guess its the same for me , and has been since I was drawing at the age of 4 . <p> Obviously everyones life is different , comprised of infinitely different things . Sometimes its just not feasible to steal time away , and I understand that , but everyone should try to make the time to do what they love through whatever means . Its a no-brainer to me . <p> If you are a creative person you should look forward to evenings , weekends and " sick days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you can sit on the couch and shut your brain off , but because that 's when you work on the stuff that truly matters .

I was firmly entrenched in the Pepsi camp of the- Cola Wars- and we had plenty of bottles in my parents fridge , but I also- needed these cans .

I used to borrow some change from my dads coin bucket and sprint through the trails leading to that Pepsi machine . There were days I made many trips to that pool just for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different can designs , however it took me the entire summer to collect them all . I was sure Pepsi had staggered their release just to prolong my agony . I ended up with tons of the surfer dude design , which ensured that it became my least favorite of the bunch . That guy used to roll out of the bottom of the vending machine and taunt me , I 'm telling you . <p> The design I most coveted was the neon one , it was the most unique of the group and was downright badass . Some- internet psychologists- may claim that I was somehow subliminally drawn to the neon design because it contained a- hidden message . When stacked 3-high and positioned just right , the larger letterforms on the can kinda-sorta spell out the word " SEX .

Saw Draplin rip up the Influxis Lounge with his 20 Points to Wreck Your Life talk . Killed it ! 20 . Sung the intro theme to My Secret Identity with friend Riley . Tight harmonies . 21 . Met a PILE of kind folks at the FITC Closing Party . You are all amazing . Many laughs had . 22 . Spotted FITCs director Shawn Pucknell sporting a Dartmouth Clothing Co. shirt . East coast ! 23 . Short but lovely conversation with the mighty and creative Jon Burgerman . <p> I 'm missing all kinds of stuff in here . Lots of gaps . But I want every last damn person I met at FITC Toronto that you really made this trip an epic event . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students. - Loved hearing stories about individual creative passions and answering questions . Keep fighting the good fight , people . You are all part of the- Signalnoise Crew of Design Hooligans- whether you like it or not . <p> And finally a massive thank-you to Shawn Pucknell , Lisa Walters , Lindsay Munro , Alfred Park , Erin Kelly and Alison Britt for everything they did to make this event a- colossal- success . For myself and everyone else . They raised the bar this year , saturating the event with inspiration , passion and downright fun . I 'd take a bullet for those six well , six bullets in total I guess . I 'd take a RIDDLING of bullets for them . Not to be messed with . Thanks so much , gang . <p> And now the evil eye of Signalnoise shifts to you , Cleveland . Things will be ramping up for WMCFest real soon . June ca n't come quick enough . You have been warned . <p> Updating from the road , holed up in my Hilton hotel room at the mighty- FITC Toronto 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and already my head is swimming with thoughts of who I 've met , hands shook , laughs had and fires ignited . <p> First off , a HUGE thank-you goes out to everyone who showed up to see my DESIGN RENEGADE talk . Man , you guys packed the room , front to back . Couldnt even believe it . Standing room only . Being the guy onstage harping about Illustrator and fonts your enthusiasm really drove the show . And then you- destroyed- my merch table , grabbing pins and posters . Thank-you so , so much everyone . Humbled . <p> Too many tales to tell at this point , but I 'm keeping notes . Before I go , check out that 8-bit slice of awesome up above . That was done by- Mike Gaboury- DURING my talk . That bugger was listening while rocking that killer pixellated graphic . Floored . You 're the man , Mike ! <p> Today at 12:25 I 'll be destroying the- Influxis Voodoo Lounge- with a complete Signalnoise poster break-down . Several designs will be displayed and I 'll rip apart my entire process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that joint . Let 's pack that room , I want to see the walls sweat . On stage right after me is that Aaron Draplin . Double threat . Be there . <p> Ill update with a nice- FITC Toronto 2012- wrap once I land back in the Signalnoise HQ . <p> Recently , while tooling around the internet in search of Computer Magazine cover art , I was blindsided by this tidal wave of nostalgia : Atari Age Magazine . <p> Like any self-respecting child of the early 80s , I was the proud owner of an Atari 2600 ( thanks mom &amp; dad ) . I spent hours playing kick-ass 8-bit games like Pitfall , Chopper Command , Commando Raid , River Raid , Vanguard , and The Empire Strikes Back . Atari was it for a few years and every kid I knew wanted one of those wicked faux-wooden consoles . For the die-hard fans , you could become an exclusive member of the prestigious Atari Club for the outrageous price of $1 . <p> Atari Age debuted in 1982 as a- perk given to all Atari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new products , interviews , technical articles , exclusive offers to Atari Club members , and a truckload of Atari-related swag . Just check out those slick Atari jackets , man what I would give for one of those suckers now . <p> Atari Age ended its publication run in 1984 , after Warner Communications sold the consumer division of Atari to Commodore International founder Jack Tramiel . For more on the magazine itself and everything else Atari , head over to atariage.com . <p> File this one under " support your friends " . I 'd like to introduce my good pal Lucas Gardiner , aka ONCE . I met Lucas a few years back when we ended up working at the same company and became fast friends . A brother in metal with the same passion for- old school- video games . And to this day he knows more about gaming than anyone I know . <p> Lucas is also a crazy good musician . Plays guitar and bass like its nobodys business . But today I 'm here to showcase his other musical talent , electronic gaming music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing a bunch of music he had built on the computer and it blew me away . Some are rockin and intricate while others are ambient and atmospheric . Some are Contra , others are Secret of Mana . Seriously good stuff , real diverse . Lucas put together a ONCE sampler pack for you to check out : 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 226302 @qwx1086302 <p> And here is a ONCE bonus track for you video game super nerds out there . 226302 @qwx1086302 <p> I know there are some independent game developers that hit my blog , so I 'd like to angle this portion of the post at you . Are you developing a game and would like a CUSTOM soundtrack to add the right atmosphere to your masterpiece ? Lucas would love to work with you . This kind of music is his passion and he s DAMN good at it . If your interested , drop him a line . <p> Ca n't say enough good things about Lucas and his ONCE work . Guy is brimming with ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . These tracks take me right back to when I was 9 years old , rockin my NES . Signalnoise got your back ONCE . <p> A few of the posters that will be available at the Signalnoise merch table . <p> New FITC logo and FITC Toronto 2012 creative . <p> Custom FITC wallpaper . <p> Signalnoise magnets will be found in the FITC delegate bags . <p> The Signalnoise HQ is in full prep mode all this week . Boxes and tubes are everywhere as I nail down all the final details for my big trip to FITC Toronto 2012 . Ill be onstage a week from today , April 23rd at 11:45am with my new talk DESIGN RENEGADE . Ca n't wait . This week might be slow on the blog as I run around like a buffoon so I thought an update was in order before stuff catches fore around here . <p> The Signalnoise presence at FITC Toronto this year will be more than what I usually do . Outside of the new logo and event creative I supplied to the FITC crew , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for after my talk so you poster hounds can check out the wares . I 'm busy printing up a bunch of previously unavailable and out of print posters ( see image above for a few ) , as well as my very first screenprint poster . Ill have 2 different colour versions of that one , 30 of each . Low number edition so act fast . On top of all that , there will be stickers and buttons as well . <p> Also , my good friends over at Abduzeedo have posted a wallpaper design I put together for the FITC crew . If you 're looking to spice up your computing device or mobile pocket thingy , swing over and have a download . Free , from all of us to you . <p> And for those attending the event , when you get your delegate bags hunt down the Signalnoise magnet in there ! Its not a piece of swag or advertisement , its a little gift I paid for out of pocket for you . Stick it on your fridge . <p> Going to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big trek to FITC Toronto 2012 .

Today Im sponsored by the city of Buffalo , NY by way of this shirt designed and gifted by the myth and legend Paul Pants . Signalnoises Buffalo correspondent , spreading the local pride . <p> Where to begin ? I just returned from my trip to Montreal for the anticipated MMTWO event where I debuted my new talk , DESIGN RENEGADE . Amazing weekend voyage that flew by far too quickly . Many laughs had , many hands shook , many friends made . Lasting memories of great conversation , seedy remarks , general joshin , poop jokes , deep thoughts and all the rest . <p> What better way to recap then a machine-gun list of moments . Let 's do this . <p> 1 . McKibbons Irish Pub gathering , minus one unfortunate Radim Malinic. 2 . Carbombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his unexpected Signalnoise iPhone skin . Magic . 4 . Hell of a nice backstage area to hang in at the venue . Came with with Jack Daniels . 5 . The mighty Fabio Sasso and his amazing story/talk. 6 . Radim Malinic finally caught up with us , destroyed the stage , and gave me a shirt . Thanks man ! 7 . Got RAD gifts from Buffalo-correspondent Paul Pants . 8 . Ate a fantastic burger and discussed- wiener-guns- with Kat Gaskin. 9 . DESIGN RENEGADE hit the stage . Had a blast . Finally noticed Colin Oakes had his hand up . 10 . Poster-seeking mob destroyed my merch table . Huge thanks everyone ! 11 . Shook hands with Nick Hess , Dave Hardy , Paul Morel , - Joseph Cotten- and Steve Schiavello. 12 . Got an awesome character design gift from Marie-Michelle ! 13 . Saw Shelby White drop mad wisdom onstage . Profound . Deep . 14 . Rik Oostenbroek did his first talk and NAILED it . Amazing work . 15 . Shelby and I threw down a big drawing collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international sensation over dinner . Pants for the PeopleG ! 17 . Saw Rik open a beer with a lighter , cap hit the ceiling ! Jaw-dropping ! 18 . Did a few doodle requests of Superman , Spider-man , Iron-man and Wolverine. 19 . Matt Marshall is from my neck of the woods , travelled to represent Nova Scotia . Pride ! 20 . The amazing and accomodating Francois Hoang , Thi Alyson and Suzana Manolache made every last detail go off without a hitch . None of this would have been possible without them . Indebted . Standing ovation ! <p> I know I 'm missing all kinds of details and names in between , but I appreciate everyone for coming out to see the talk . ALL our talks .

Over the last few weeks everything has been coming together from the packaging , goodies , printing , and of course the cards themselves . Getting real close now . <p> The print production shots above were snapped by the crack team down at Mamas Sauce who have been hard at work screen-printing all the cards . Just look at those colours . Amazing . Not only have they been printing stuff up but they suggested including a special Mamas Sauce GUM CARD with all orders ( while supplies last ) . So everyone who pledged during the campaign will be getting this fancy freebie , and its printed with metallic inks . So class . <p> Also landing at the HQ have been the extra goodies . Shown above are the GUM CARDS stickers as well as the special GUM CARDS Collector patches . These goodies will be included with the pledge packages as well as all orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be a brand new GUM CARDS website launching once the cards are prepped to order . <p> Big days ahead . Thanks so much for the continued enthusiasm toward the project everyone . It truly means a lot . Remember to follow GUM CARDS on Twitter to keep up to date on all the action . <p> Since the GUM CARDS fundraising effort came to a ( successful ) close , I 've been hard at work gathering all the little bits and pieces necessary to ship out the GUM CARDS once I- receive- them . The Signalnoise HQ has been filling up with boxes full of mailers , zip-locks , top-loader card cases , buttons and stickers . Ca n't wait to get all this gear into action . <p> On the printing front , all the files have been prepped and shuffled off to Mamas Sauce down in Orlando so they can begin their print wizardry . <p> Just a small update to keep everyone up to date . Everything is moving forward and in the coming weeks the HQ will be ablaze with the shipping process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cards Twitter and check out the official site for all the latest news . <p> The final numbers are in . Through your- generosity- and support , the GUM CARDS fundraising effort has raised a whopping $5,303 . Amazing . When I launched this project a month ago I really had no idea what would happen . It started as a fun , silly little idea . Something I 'd collect if they existed . But here we are with a successful funding campaign facilitating everything and more to move forward . <p> This post is for everyone who helped me out this month . You know who you are . Your tweets , messages , posts , comments , pledges and encouragement kept this thing going and I 'm hard at work over here getting all the little pieces together . The cards are in production and will be mailed out as soon as they are in my hands . Huge thank everyone . <p> Here we are , the final day of the GUM CARDS fundraising effort . What a heck of a month this has been . Over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goodies , web graphics and everything else needed to keep the train moving . And out there on the web all of you have been lending your support through tweets , pledges , blog posts and general- encouragement . Just , wow . <p> As I type these words we have 17 hours remaining as we sprint to the finish line . The project has already been successfully funded but every little bit counts , meaning I can push the subsequent cards into production . As it stands , the Aaron Draplin and Johnny Cupcakes cards are being printed now with the Stefan Sagmeister card close on their heels . Everything is moving , gang . <p> So , if you 've been waiting to pledge and secure the first 2 GUM CARDS , now is the time to act . Swing over to the Indiegogo fundraising page to see how you can help . Were down to the wire and this funny little project has grown far beyond all expectation . Ill be working hard to make it count . Thanks so much everyone . <p> As i type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARDS Indiegogo- fundraising- effort . We reached the goal a couple of weeks ago but I 'm still running hard as I can toward the finishing line as the more we raise , the more cards I can move into production straight away . Down to the crunch ! <p> So this afternoon , Tuesday the 7th at 2pm EST there will be a special GUM CARDS live broadcast . Since the project launched quite a lot has happened as I created more cards and materials to support the GUM CARDS experience , so the broadcast today will serve as a big summarization on the last month cover all the details . Along with the story , I 'll discuss the print process ramp-up and a few other fun ideas I want to incorporate into the project as it goes . After all the formalities , I 'll open the floor to a Q&amp;A session with the audience . Possible laughs ! <p> Since I came up with the GUM CARDS idea Ive been thinking about the myriad of stuff I wanted to design around it to make the entire experience richer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement as if it appeared on the back of a comic book in 1986 . So I made one , inspired by old Lego and Nintendo- advertisements- from when I was a kid . Big names . Small cards . <p> So a bit of news . The clock is ticking down to the end of the GUM CARDS Indiegogo fundraising . As of next Wednesday it will be done , - effectively- wrapping up phase one of the project . So if you were planning on pledging but have n't gotten around to it yet , time is running short . Cut in line to secure your GUM CARDS . <h> GUM CARDS Live Broadcast <p> A lot has been happening since I kicked off the GUM CARDS project . 3 new cards have been revealed , funding goal has been met and production has begun . But the easiest way to discuss all of this stuff is live . So this coming Tuesday ( the 7th ) I 'll be doing a second special GUM CARDS SNBC broadcast discussing everything about the project . This will be the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more about GUM CARDS be sure to tune in live . I 'll tell stories , show some goodies and answer questions live . <p> Once again , a big thanks to everyone who has supported and encouraged the project . You have all made this experience incredible , and were just at the beginning . <p> Here we go , a new week and a new GUM CARD . I 'm crazy excited to announce the 5th card in the series , none other than that typographic wizard Jessica Hische . When I made the initial list of designers I wanted to include in the project , Jessicas name was right at the top . And as I discovered over the last few weeks , she is probably the " most requested " designer to have her own GUM CARD . No foolin , I got piles of notes demanding a Hische . <p> I managed to hang out with Jessica and a small group of people in Brighton last year at Flash on the Beach . Funny gal , great stories , swears and loves talkin about type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we go , 5 GUM CARDS designs with more on the way . As of typing this post we have 7 days left on the Indiegogo fundraising effort . Only 7 days to cut in line and grab the first two cards before they are unleashed online to the masses . These are all limited edition , man . Once they 're gone , they 're gone . So if you 're planning on pledging , do n't  drag those heels . <p> Thank-you so much for being a part of this little project , Jessica ! You rock . <p> I 'm super excited to unveil the 4th card in the GUM CARDS series , one of my favorite designers out there these days , none other than UK-based poster wizard Olly Moss . Ive been a fan of that guy for a couple of years now , ever since seeing his wonderful illustrations pop up on Flickr , prior to his killer collaborations with the mighty Mondo . <p> So , with Olly onboard this brings the GUM CARDS series to 4 cards in size which I will be printing- sequentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of getting the first 2 cards printed down at Mamas Sauce so watch this space for details on when the cards will be made available .

Check out the rewards that correspond with your pledge . Only 14 days left to get onboard . <p> And of course , a big thanks to Olly for being a part of this . Means a lot , thanks buddy .

@@121792237 @10792237/ <p> Alex Varanese is a beast . His work started showing up on Ffffound over the past two days and I literally had a " whoa " moment when I hit his website . <p> Alex has a beautiful blend of retro greatness mixed with urban grittiness and typography , certainly not an easy style to hit . But the bay area artist does it smooth and sweet , to the point where his works seem almost effortless in execution . That topmost highway design is just killer , excellent aesthetic eye . <p> I only plucked a few of my favorites for this post , but be prepared to get steamrolled by the size of Alexs portfolio . Check out his website , his Behance , and say hello on his Twitter . <p> Here are some screen shots and poster from the film Moon starring Sam Rockwell that came out last year . I had seen the poster kicking around Ffffound for the past few months but my trip to New York finally afforded me some airplane time to watch a movie . Moon was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the conceptual design for costumes , props and sets was extremely well done . I 'm a big fan of what Kubrick did with 2001 , and Moon is certainly a sci-fi film aimed directly at the same style and pacing . The computer interface and signage designs on the moon base show some wonderful typography and basic shapes . The props are very utilitarian and rugged , very practical for the environment the film takes place in . <p> Plus , Sam Rockwell is awesome . If you have n't seen Moon yet , I 'd recommend having a look . <p> The Signalnoise Studio has a new mascot , thanks to a birthday gift from my sister . Standing at 4.5 inches long , Emperoth is small but mighty . He enjoys black metal , fish flakes and taking long swims in the tank . <p> I asked him to be a guest writer on the blog , but he burped bubbles at me and hid in his skull .

I have been operating as strictly an individual freelance artist for the past few years and I felt it was time to make the push and set up the structure needed to grow in the business realm . So I have been going through the motions of setting up everything needed to get all processes running smoothly . Its all new and weird , but its all exciting . <p> At the same time , I 've been working diligently on a new version of Signalnoise.com . If you 've been following my tweets over the past while you would have noticed me bitching about CSS stuff , and that 's why : ) When it comes to my website I 'm a real sticky bastard about not changing things too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and I do n't  want to have to get used to some new crazy thing . So , the new Signalnoise.com will be a bit beefier but maintain a similar overall aesthetic . I have no solid launch date as yet , so all I can say is soon . <p> While at the same time Ive been working with some really great clients , two of which are Reckless Love and Nike while cultivating some new exciting jobs over the past few weeks . Not only will I be kicking off these new projects , but the next few months will see me speaking at FITC Toronto ( see my presentation entitled Back to the Future ) this April . <p> On top of everything else , I just returned from an excellent trip to New York where I took part in Immersion Day at Getty Images office as part of the ThinkCorps team . Ill have more to say about this soon as it might require its own post , but some big highlights were meeting folks like Adelle Charles and Josh Smibert from the mighty Fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Fiorelli of the Cut &amp; Paste digital design tournament and a bunch more .

Since the games officially kicked off , the crack team over at The Canadian Design Resource have been posting a lot of wonderful Olympic material from the past . Lovely stuff , so I plucked a few of my favorites to show here . <p> Beautiful illustration and design work by Netherlands-based artist Stefan Glerum . Stefans obvious and honest appreciation of illustration from the past took me by complete surprise this morning . Not only is his pencil work beautiful and appropriately aged , he had an excellent eye for aesthetic , color and typography . <p> His hand-lettered elements and odd characters harken back to 1920s Europe , maybe with a touch of Bauhaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im thrilled to see someone take such an off-kilter illustration style and apply it to modern projects and events . <p> This work is so accurately executed , I cant believe its current .

A Lyric a Day has Luke making an image showcasing a line from a song of his choice , and he s been sticking to his guns creating interesting and textured designs every day since the launch . <p> Not only am I enjoying Lukes textured creations ( which I 've been checking out for a couple of years now ) but its interesting to see his work evolve as a result of this project .

@@121792241 @10792241/ <p> Here is a small supplemental to yesterdays sticker post . I 'm still calling these things sticker concepts , but I 'm not sure what the final destination may be . Wont worry too much about that right now , got lots of these I want to do . <p> I 'm calling these 2 part of the " public service " line . I was walking over to the office yesterday when I came across a sign that said Fire Fleet , and the idea for the design above popped into my head . Had to be done , followed closely by a design for the Signalnoise Crime Response unit . Look out you arsonist crooks , were watching ! <p> Been uploading these to my Google+ for first peaks if you want the inside track . <p> If you have been following my Google+ stream over the last few days you would have seen me posting some Signalnoise sticker concepts , at least that 's what I 've been calling them . Shown here are 6 design I came up with over the weekend , exploring a different style and content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspiration behind this content is a bit blurry . Kind of a mix of boy scouts , provincial park signage , old Lego toys , NASA mission patches ( 5th one down is a total NASA ape ) and other stuff . Somehow very Canadian , even though I cant put my finger on it . You know back in the 80s when you 'd get a Fisher Price space guy and hed have a cool little logo on his shoulder ? A bit of that too , I guess , or how I remember it now even though I cant find any reference . That make sense ? <p> A little while back when I said I was refreshing the Signalnoise identity for use in new work , this is kind of what I was talking about . Ive been doing fancy Photoshop stuff for a number of years now and I 've been really feeling my attention shifting to content that 's more simple and pure . Vector-heavy stuff with more limited colors . Ive been using Illustrator just as long as Photoshop ( since 95 ) but I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors plucked from my logo , plus black of course . Looking forward to experimenting with more shapes as well . <p> So , more of this to come ? You bet your ass . Im having way too much fun over here sketching these things in my Field Notes and throwing down some thick lines in Illustrator . <p> If you 've been following my Google+ page you would have seen me talking about this new piece over the past week . I was asked by the kind people at Advanced Photoshop Magazine to develop a design in order to break it down into a tutorial for the newest issue , so I set about building a new poster I call Creator . <p> here 's the thing . I have a very organic , or maybe crazy is a better word , method of conceiving and developing my artwork . I start out with an idea or concept then start chasing that image through my head by way of vectors , stock photography , personal assets and all the other nuts and bolts of my process . The problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into 18 easy-to-follow steps so readers can make their own piece . I cant even explain how difficult that is for me to do . I even had a few bad starts on the job , here are some initial concepts : <p> In the case of Creator , I made a stripped down version for publication in Advanced Photoshop , then after the deadline I continued working on it to realize my initial vision for the final . More details , lighting , color adjustments and all that . I tinkered with this for weeks after it was sent off and had a ball doing it . <p> On the left is the final image I sent off to Advanced Photoshop for the tutorial , and on the right is work-in-progress version of the poster as I kept working on it . You will see all kinds of little changes I was making as I went along , involving little details , color adjustments , highlights and all that . I even swapped out the gem for a Tron disc thing . Great fun . <p> This poster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really caught my attention . I was pretty impressed with the run of posters The Dark Knight spawned a couple of years ago and it looks like they 're keeping a similar vibe going for the new movie . <p> Really dig this one . The buildings forming the Bat symbol in the negative space looks real smooth and smart , nothing clumsy going on here . Its not too often I talk about new movie posters here on the blog , but I felt this one deserved a bit of time . Not much more to say then that . Well done , Wayne Industries ! <p> Throw this one into the " good people doing good work " file . At the beginning of all my broadcasts you will hear me say something like " Coming at you live from Dartmouth , Nova Scotia . " Well , that 's where I live . We are a rough and tumble little crew holding down the shores of Dartmouth . A proud crew , who may or may not carry switchblades . <p> Well , allow me to introduce you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated , built , muscled and chiseled by my mohawked pal Eric Miller . He works his ass off on his designs , screen-prints all of these shirts in his basement by hand , then packs and ships everything on his own . This is homegrown , people . This is where its at . Brute force Eric . Not to be messed with . <p> There are 2 reasons why Eric and his Dartmouth Clothing Co. are landing on the blog . First off , Signalnoise supports this guy and what he s doing . All on his own , just getting it done in 1-color awesomeness . Secondly , Eric and I had a meeting a little while back about a team-up , which I 'm really excited about . Dartmouth Clothing Co. vs . Signalnoise . Designs are flowing and I 'm excited to see these things on shirts . More details to come , so stay tuned . <p> I 'm a really hesitant guy to jump on board any new " community-based whatever " on the web these days . I 'm cautious about spreading myself too thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general need to have my work centralized . Its all about housekeeping around here , I like simplicity . <p> However , when Google recently launched its Google+ platform , I decided to give this new thing a shot . I was generously hooked up with an invitation by my pal Fabio Sasso and was off to the races . Before plugging it on the blog I wanted to take a week and experiment with it . Launch a few previews , set up my contacts , just to see how the vibe was on this new sharing platform . Have to say , I 'm rather pleased . Even added it to the top-right corner of the site for safe keeping . <p> So , if you are one of those Plusers , swing by the James White Google+ and have a look . There might even be a Signalnoise hang-out in the near future . And why not say hello to these fine folks as well : <p> Now , the last thing I want to do is offer up a review of Google+ . I suck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even going to attempt to sound smart in that area . Plus , there are plenty of opinions already floating around as to why Google+ is good/bad . But as a creative guy with a bunch of nice online pals and connections , and who is looking for a Facebook alternative , Google+ ai n't  too shabby . Looks orderly , stuff is clean , its simple with all kinds of subtle user-friendly features . I dig it . <p> Will it crush Facebook ? Nobody is a prophet , man . Just see for yourself . <p> here 's one for the proud Canadians . When growing up in the 80s I was inevitably into baseball . And being from Canada you had the choice of 2 teams unless you decided to be a jerk and cheer for an American team . That was a joke , simmer down . Ha ! <p> Along with most of the kids , my favorite team was the mighty Toronto Blue Jays . I cheered my ass off for the boys in blue , and even got to see them win back-to-back World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 3-run homer in the bottom of the 9th to win the Series in 1993 you could hear our whole country scream . What a wild night . <p> But I digress . This post is for that Jays logo above . Created the year I was born and lasted throughout my childhood , to me , this is the one and only identity the Blue Jays will ever need . They redesigned the logo 2 or 3 times over the last 15 years , none of which can possibly hold a candle to this one . Simple , elegant , and comprised of pretty basic shapes . Prints beautifully and looks good from afar . You cant beat that . The current logo does n't  even have a maple leaf in there . For shame . <p> So this one is for you , Jays logo of old . Canada will always love you . <p> here 's one for Canada . I was asked by my good pal Sean " Wordburglar " Jordan to design a cover for the upcoming album by Canadian hip-hop crew Backburner . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most fulfilling and this one was no exception . SJ sent me over a little brief of what the cover might entail and I got to work . <p> I had a lot of fun working on this one . The album is called Heatwave and needed to obviously bring the heat . Fire , sun , desert , a hyena and a giant burner to set the stage . Loads of orange . Huge orange . When it comes to the palette , working with orange in Photoshop is super versatile and you can really play with some nice reds and yellows in there . <p> I wish I could name everyone in the Backburner crew , but there are a million guys in there representing different parts of Canada . Me and SJ are holding down the Halifax turf . So watch for this one , gang . Canadian talent , not to be messed with .

For those who are familiar with his work , you know his unique system of pacing . Mignola is n't concerned with loading each panel and page with as much crap as he can , he does the opposite by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking through a forest with panels dedicated to showing flowers or a solitary bird sitting on a branch . <p> Another lovely design choice is his use of color , or more specifically , Dave Stewarts use of color . His backgrounds and other characters tend to have a desaturated palette while Hellboy , and Hellboy alone , has a pure vibrant red . This sets his character apart on the page and makes him special . Excellent design choice . <p> Finally , Mikes cover design capabilities . Me and my comic nerd buddies tend to make fun whenever we see a new Hellboy cover " Oh , there 's Hellboy standing in a plume of smoke again with heads and skulls behind him ! " but its always kind-hearted . Mignola takes great care in constructing the elements of his covers , pulling cues from the story and arranging them with interest and atmosphere . Beautiful stuff . <p> If you are familiar with Hellboy , keep rockin . If not , might I suggest checking out the short story entitled " The Corpse " for a wonderful example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn genius . Sinister stillness , ink and shadow in every panel I still cant forget the panel of a frog-monster cradling its dying mother in its arms ( Plague of Frogs , maybe ? ) . It was tragic that the live action movies reduced his aesthetic to the fabricated , shiny plastic production design of an X-Men movie . <p> You mention Sin City I think Frank Millers use of minimalist composition , especially in Vol. 1 ( The Hard Goodbye ) is the only comic art that rivals Mignolas . I now want to go back and read all those Hellboy collections Ive missed . Thanks a lot , there , SignalNoise . <p> Take the time to draw diagonal lines from corner to corner of a panel or even the whole page . You will see just how much care goes into Mikes compositions and the structure that underlies it . Brilliant craftsmanship .

Its amazing how someone can go from so high to so low in such a dramatic fashion , definitely worth watching if you 're at all interested in 80s subculture . <p> Watching Stoked got me reminiscing about those old board designs and I began scanning the web for imagery from back then , especially the Vision gear which I remember most clearly . Ads , decks , etc. , there was just so much that it actually defined skateboarding for a short period . <p> As Vision grew , they branched out into other sports and started an infamous street wear clothing line . Predictably , once the company- became too mainstream and commercialized , the skateboard subculture rejected it . The backlash was quick and lethal to the Vision brand .

It seems like simple formula , but the corporate landscape is littered with these kinds of examples . <p> Vision still exists to this day , but as a mere ghost of its former identity .

I created pieces for DRIVE , BLADE RUNNER , THE THING , MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE , INDIANA JONES , TERMINATOR 2 and some others , all of which can be found in my portfolio . I made it my mission to break into the alternative art movie poster industry , but unfortunately only 2 posters were officially printed and offered for sale . The others remained in legal limbo , personal development , self-initiated projects whatever you want to call it . <p> Aside from what was released online I did a lot of work behind the scenes developing ideas and visuals for many of my favorite movies . I never had permission , I designed them merely for my own enjoyment and practise . Most are thumbnails in my sketchbook while others I pushed to a digital sketch .

Be there , Toronto ! <p> I 've never spent too much time on a skateboard , aside from a few brief stints in the late 80s ( all of which ended in complete and total failure ) . Geography certainly played a role , as Western New York has never been confused with Southern California as a skateboarding hotbed , but at its peak in the 80s almost every kid in my neighborhood owned a skateboard . I was a year or two behind the curve when it came to the " scene " , but the older kids relentlessly rocked those neon-colored boards up and down my street all summer long . <p> Recently , I watched- Stoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the roller coaster life of former Vision frontman Mark " Gator " Rogowski. - His Vision Gator series was everywhere when I was a kid and almost everyone I knew had one of his signature boards with that distinct spiral pattern on it . Its amazing how someone can go from so high to so low in such a dramatic fashion , definitely worth watching if you 're at all interested in 80s subculture . <p> Watching Stoked got me reminiscing about those old board designs and I began scanning the web for imagery from back then , especially the Vision gear which I remember most clearly . Ads , decks , etc. , there was just so much that it actually defined skateboarding for a short period . <p> As Vision grew , they branched out into other sports and started an infamous street wear clothing line . Predictably , once the company- became too mainstream and commercialized , the skateboard subculture rejected it . The backlash was quick and lethal to the Vision brand . Some kids were turned off by the corporate image and stopped skating altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear were simply cast off as sell-outs . Vision became a parody of itself . <p> Its a cautionary tale for independent brands whose audience has a distinct counterculture base : do n't  alienate your core audience , do n't  betray their loyalty and devotion , do n't  forget your roots . It seems like simple formula , but the corporate landscape is littered with these kinds of examples . <p> Vision still exists to this day , but as a mere ghost of its former identity . Just like the once great " Gator " himself , Visions heydays have passed them by , the height of their success forever shackled to the decade that originally made them . <p> At the last minute I was offered a ticket to see Prince perform live in Halifax . Most of my friends were already going and I was on the fence long enough to assume I would n't be going . Really happy that was n't the case .

@@121792293 @10792293/ <p> Last week on Twitter I was talking about my recent commission by Newsweek Magazine to design the cover for their July 4th issue . I got a call early last week straight from the Newsweek HQ which I was pretty excited about . I 've done a few covers in the past , but Newsweek has been on my radar and the " itd be cool to work with them " goal list for quite some time . I was tasked with bringing a cover from scratch to final in a few days . Not easy , but the team there wanted big fancy text relating to the cover story . Just what I like doing . Rock n roll . <p> But the magazine industry , more specifically the NEWS magazine industry , is a turbulent beast with fluctuating focuses and news items . Things change at the last minute all the time , including stories that land the cover . Unfortunately that 's what happened and they had to go with a different story and different cover . Bummer . Shown above is what I did for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsweek told me up front that a few covers were in consideration as they put together the issue , so the outcome is totally understandable . One of those things . In the end I had a great time working on this , it was an honor to be considered and I 'm proud to add it to my portfolio . <p> Its no secret that I like my metal , so I wanted to post a little something outside of the regular Signalnoise content stream . If you 've been into metal for any length of time you may have crossed path with the Japanese 3-piece drone , sludge , psychedelic rock outfit Boris . These guys have quite a history and seem to put out 100 records a year . <p> Now I 'm the first to say , Boris is certainly an acquired taste . I was introduced to them by my friend Ryan Grant some time ago , at which point I had the " what the hell is this ? " look on my face . Noisy , confusing , fuzzy . Made no sense to me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually I came around . Now they 're one of my favorite bands , nothing sounds quite like them , and I dig that . <p> But let 's get back to design . I have to give Boris some huge respect for their album artwork and band identity . They never seem to sit still on a design or theme , constantly re-inventing their look and logo every time they release something . When you hear rumbles of a new Boris album , you never know what you 're going to get . Crazy generative artwork , a beautiful painting , a sombre photograph , hand-drawn something-or-other . Yet it all works , somehow . Coming up with new and wildly different artwork just CANT be an easy task . You got ta respect that . <p> And look at those Boris logos . All different , all awesome . The albums above are just a handful of their releases . <p> Today is the day . My pal Ian " Jerko " Cann , national treasure , international man of metal , collector of toys , sayer of funny things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be losing one of its most famous and beloved landmarks , his trademark beard . Anyone that has met Jerko remembers his laugh and his beard . Just look at that thing . <p> The plan was made ages ago and he s not backing down . 6 years in the making , it comes down to this . His reasons are his own and maybe hell share them here . Or maybe not , he s a complex man . Either way , today the beard is coming off and the Signalnoise HQ has his back . <p> A moment of silence for Jerkos beard , and another moment for the poor pair of shears that will no doubt be destroyed by that behemoth . <p> With the launch of the revised Signalnoise identity and wallpaper last week , I 've been working hard to implement the switch across my entire online presence . No easy task . It was n't until I dove in that I realized just how often I use my logo on stuff . Mastheads , buttons , banners , profile pictures , backgrounds its all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messing with my graphics across the board and staring at my site for hours , little issues started catching my attention .

Little stuff , nothing major , but stuff that will make your viewing and reading experience a bit better . I hope . General housecleaning , which I think everyone should do from time to time . <p> One major thing on the go is the Signalnoise Store .

I like my wallpaper to be clean , tidy , organized , tough and reliable . No crazy designs getting in the way of the folders on my desktop . I launched my previous logo as a wallpaper set about 2 years ago , so its about time we got the new one into circulation . Here are the sizes . <p> That 's right , Halifax . The second Halifax Design Meet is scheduled for tomorrow night . The last time I organized something like this was back in March , so were long overdue to kick back , have a drink and talk about fonts . here 's the details : <p> Here is something that has been inevitable and has been on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched my t-shirt line a year ago it was my first big attempt at printing in a new medium , more specifically , paying for each color when screen printing . If you 're not laughing now , you should be , as its clear that was n't taken into account when I designed my full-spectrum logo in 2008 . So as I went about designing things for the t-shirt line I realized how inflexible my rainbow sun was . <p> Not only did it involve 6 colors , but all those colors overlapped creating an additional 6 colors , 12 in total . In screen print land this is a nightmare to deal with as the t-shirt company needed to overlap the 6 colors manually to create the full 12 . While it looked okay , this created inconsistencies with my brand colors which I always had a problem with . I started looking at brands such as Johnny Cupcakes , Coudal Partners and Draplin Design Co. to see how their identities worked and it was obvious that I needed to make some adjustments in order to get the Signalnoise identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum , maintain the overall shape that has been mine for a few years now , yet be more usable in different product areas . <p> Also , the 1-color version of my logo . Ive been wanting to get into producing other Signalnoise products ( such as pens , key-chains and other cool swag ) but a big factor is printing in 1 to 3 colors to reduce cost . When I flattened my logo it looked like a flower . Lame . Ca n't deny that . All the circles blended together into one big flat , uninteresting shape . I never liked that 1-color version of my logo , to the point where I was reluctant to use it anywhere on the web and printing . It had to change , and that was that . <p> And lastly , my Signalnoise wordmark . Ive been using the Agostina wordmark for just over a year now and I still love it . The nice swooshes look pretty 70s while maintaining that cool modern vibe . Its a fun typeface to work with for sure and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when going over the new product ideas . Would it look good printed really small , like on a pen ? Does it center well on a shirt ? Does it work properly as a title with additional content below ? The answer to those questions was mostly " no " . The stylized Signalnoise wordmark was always a bit awkward to work with on stickers , shirts and other stuff which is why you rarely saw it outside of the website masthead . It all comes down to function , man . <p> Over the last 3 years I 've been adjusting the typefaces used across my brand , starting with the website . I used Egyptienne for quite a while because I always liked that face , but slowly moved over to a san serif , standardized design . When I felt the need to redesign my Signalnoise wordmark , the selection was clear . My beloved Akzidenz-Grotesk . Sturdy , reliable , practical and readable . Also , this was the first time I spent a considerable amount of time kerning the wordmark to have it flow properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never HOW to do it . Huge thanks to all the kind folks on Twitter who helped me out and gave advice as I tweaked it up , specifically to those who referred me to this article . Mega help , thanks gang . <p> The one thing I never like to standardize is how the logo and wordmark play together . I like having the flexibility to move each element independently in consideration of where its being displayed . Here are just a couple of combinations and I 'm sure others will present itself as I continue : <p> In conclusion , I need to make one point clear . I love my rainbow sun . I love the colors , how they blended , and its basically the only logo I ever designed for myself that I liked . Feeling the need to adjust it was painful . I knew it was coming , I knew it was necessary , and I thought long and hard before moving in any direction . I did it delicately , and stared at the final for a week and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the end , I feel I hit that elusive middle ground of new flexibility while maintaining the elements and form I loved most about it . And all it took was shifting the circles .

Its a shame this amount of hardcore magazine design seems to have fallen by the wayside . <p> I 'm a big fan of Lego , and I 'm an even bigger fan of people using the toys for creative means . People use Lego to make intricate sculptures and pixel-esque portraits , but Mike Stimpson is raising the bar .

It seems to have only been used as a holding page for the site , which is a bit of a shame . Beautiful logo rendering , perfect contrast to the natural seascape . <p> Last year I was contracted by VH1 Latin America to develop some style boards for their upcoming network rebrand . MTV really wanted to push a retro/modern theme using bright colors inspired by those network ids from the 1970s , so I had a great time developing some artwork for them to use throughout the campaign . <p> The video above is a compilation of all the motion work created by the talented folks at Laundrymat in Los Angeles .

This was a little study I created to look at shape overlays using a color palette I 'm not overly familiar with . I started with one triangle and proceeded to duplicate it over and over to see how much interest I could get in there . <p> Ive been digging the work of Matt W.

As I mentioned yesterday , I 've already started the process of getting the first 2 cards printed down at Mamas Sauce so watch this space for details on when the cards will be made available . Only 250 of each with 50 variants . Slim numbers . <p> If you want to cut in line and reserve your cards before they sell out , the GUM CARDS Indiegogo is a great way to do just that . Check out the rewards that correspond with your pledge . Only 14 days left to get onboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a part of this . Means a lot , thanks buddy . <p> As I announced on the blog and on Twitter last Friday , we have surpassed our funding goal of $4,000 .

As of 1pm today the vector files for the Aaron Draplin and Johnny Cupcakes cards have been sent down to the crack team at Mamas Sauce so they can start working their screen-printing magic . Screens will be made , stock will be set and inks will be flung .

This means we- officially- have the greenlight to move all the elements into production mode to get this thing moving . Amazing ! <p> The sudden lurch forward in funding came from none other than Dave Hardy out in Portland , Oregon . Dave wrangled together the necessary resources to secure the whopping Diamond Pledge package , which means in November I 'll be flying out to Portland , partnering with Spaceman Design and AIGA Portland to do a DESIGN RENEGADE speaking event . Man oh man , you do n't  even know how excited I am for this . Portland !

When events happen that mean a lot to me , whether that 's music , movies , television or whatever , I 'd like to have that play into the GUM CARDS continuity . This is an expansive idea , but instead of explaining it through boring text I thought showing an example is my best bet .

Little discs with nice art . <p> Like the GUM CARDS Collectors Patch , I will be moving these pogs into production if we overshoot the $4,000 goal .

I was really into the NES and SNES when I was growing up , spending countless hours playing games on my own or with my buddy Mike . But as I grew up the game console was steadily replaced by my sketchbook and then Photoshop . But I never lost touch with my gaming roots and try to stay informed as to what 's going on in the industry as best I can . <p> This weekend I watched the whole Flappy Bird thing unfold and it was a real bummer to see . This cute little game made by a guy over in Vietnam achieved unexpected success , and immediately the online gaming audience swooped in to bash the hell out of it . Its no secret that a large part of the gaming world are just rotten people , but still . In the end , the developer took the game down . I wont get into detail here , click the link above if you want the scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference other things , I enjoyed the Mario Bros. influence the game brought with it . Yes , INFLUENCE which is different than " ripping off " . But hey , that 's just how I see it . 
@@121792315 @10792315/ <h> A Fistful of Wicked 80s Print Ads <p> The 1980s were wicked-awesome and the print ads of that decade were par for the course . They were playful and sophisticated , the focus trending toward less copy and more imagery . Ads often consisted of a bold , catchy headlines with a single large product shot bathed in a spectrum of color . Does n't  get much better than that . <p> After sifting through thousands of these 80s ads , the layouts and type choices can admittedly become quite predictable ; but they never become tiresome to me . Its true that we often romanticize the past , and that 's very possible what I 'm doing here , but I ca n't help but feel coming up with these ads thirty-some years ago was a lot of fun . I cant say I look forward to doing any ads in this day and age . <p> You have to admire the strong grid foundations these ads are constructed on ; so solid .

Ive been a fan of that guy for a couple of years now , ever since seeing his wonderful illustrations pop up on Flickr , prior to his killer collaborations with the mighty Mondo . <p> So , with Olly onboard this brings the GUM CARDS series to 4 cards in size which I will be printing- sequentially . As I mentioned yesterday , I 've already started the process of getting the first 2 cards printed down at Mamas Sauce so watch this space for details on when the cards will be made available . Only 250 of each with 50 variants . Slim numbers . <p> If you want to cut in line and reserve your cards before they sell out , the GUM CARDS Indiegogo is a great way to do just that . Check out the rewards that correspond with your pledge . Only 14 days left to get onboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a part of this . Means a lot , thanks buddy . <p> As I announced on the blog and on Twitter last Friday , we have surpassed our funding goal of $4,000 . Since that happened I 've been lining up everything involved to get the GUM CARDS project mobilized which has effectively taken over my entire schedule . And that is by now means a complaint , I 'm having a ball over here . <p> Ive been busy ordering shipping supplies , buttons , stickers and of course prepping card files . As of 1pm today the vector files for the Aaron Draplin and Johnny Cupcakes cards have been sent down to the crack team at Mamas Sauce so they can start working their screen-printing magic . Screens will be made , stock will be set and inks will be flung . Watch this space as we bring the GUM CARDS from the computer to reality in quality form . <p> As this is happening , that GUM CARDS Indiegogo fundraiser is still going strong . The more we manage the raise , the more cards will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . <p> I cant even believe it . As of 2:15 pm Atlantic Time today the GUM CARDS project has surpassed its funding goal of $4000 , and we still have 20 days of fundraising to go . Absolutely shaking with anticipation over here . This means we- officially- have the greenlight to move all the elements into production mode to get this thing moving . Amazing ! <p> The sudden lurch forward in funding came from none other than Dave Hardy out in Portland , Oregon . Dave wrangled together the necessary resources to secure the whopping Diamond Pledge package , which means in November I 'll be flying out to Portland , partnering with Spaceman Design and AIGA Portland to do a DESIGN RENEGADE speaking event . Man oh man , you do n't  even know how excited I am for this . Portland ! You and me ! <p> I want to thank each and every one of you who have helped move this little project forward over the last 10 days . Your support on every level means the absolute world to me . Ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beware next week as the GUM CARDS project takes on an entirely new life . Busy revving the engines over here ! <p> Here is a special GUM CARD that I designed specifically for today . I 'm pretty excited to head out to the midnight screening of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES tonight and I thought it would be fun to launch a GUM CARD featuring the Caped Crusader . <p> As I said before , I have lots of ideas on how I want to expand the GUM CARDS universe over the next while and this card is an example of that . When events happen that mean a lot to me , whether that 's music , movies , television or whatever , I 'd like to have that play into the GUM CARDS continuity . This is an expansive idea , but instead of explaining it through boring text I thought showing an example is my best bet . THE DARK KNIGHT RISES opens tonight , so what better time to launch a Batman card ? See where I 'm going with this ? <p> So the GUM CARDS Indiegogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARDS project so far , swing on over to see how you can help out . Every bit counts in trying to make this project a reality . Here are a bunch of links relevant to GUM CARDS : <p> Aside from the stickers , buttons and patches I want to have made to include with all GUM CARDS orders , I designed an additional fun little item I 'd like to produce . Pogs ! I was a bit too old to be into pogs back in the day , but I always liked the idea . Little discs with nice art . <p> Like the GUM CARDS Collectors Patch , I will be moving these pogs into production if we overshoot the $4,000 goal . The additional funds will be kept within the project in the form of additional cards and goodies . Really ca n't wait to get all this stuff mobilized if we hit that Indiegogo fundraising goal . <p> The line-up of GUM CARDS now has a third addition . I 'm proud to announce that world-renowned designer and typographer Stefan Sagmeister landed card #3 in the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this news . When I was putting together the roster I thought " What superstar designer should I ask ? Who would seem impossible ? Whos talked at TED ? " . Stefan was that guy , and here he is . <p> But that Indiegogo page is going strong and I still need your help to make this project a reality . If pledging is n't your thing , I truly appreciate any tweets or blog posts that help spread the word on GUM CARDS . The response has been absolutely amazing so far with over half of the funds raised to get this thing going . Another HUGE thank-you to those who have taken the time to tell their friends about this . Trusted sources , you know who you are . <p> And finally a big thanks to Stefan Sagmeister for agreeing to be a part of this . So excited , man .

I launched the GUM CARDS Indiegogo page on Monday at noon and since then we 've raised almost half of our final $4000 goal . Half ! I 'm still in plenty of shock over that one . Unbelievable . <p> From the moment I launched the project people jumped at the opportunity to help out . I saw so many tweets , comments , emails , pledges and blog posts pop up all week as people got behind this little passion project and I cant tell you how much that means to me . I created GUM CARDS because if this set already existed , I 'd definitely be collecting it . So to see so many like-minded people jump in to support it really brings a tear to my eye .

@@121792318 @10792318/ <p> I 'm really excited to announce the release of my Signalnoise Source group of Photoshop and Illustrator files now available for purchase in the Signalnoise Store . This project was originally supposed to be available through the order of a DVD , but I wanted to cut out the production cost and wait time of orders . So , I shifted things to a download for more instant usability . <p> The purpose of my releasing these source files is simple , to show people how I work . I field many questions from designers via my broadcast , Twitter and email regarding process , so now you can have a look inside the files and even play with the elements yourself . All of the layers , modes and effects are intact so you can really get a sense of how these images are built by exploring each element . And if you used any of these files to create something of your own , why not upload your creation to the newly formed Signalnoise Flickr group . <p> You can place an order for the Photoshop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file is 150dpi at 1200 x 1500 . Once you place the order you will be able to instantly download the corresponding ZIP file . You will be ready to open these files up and start experimenting and creating right away . <p> Now the stern bit . Because I would like to do more of these in the future , please treat these files with respect . By " respect " , I mean the following : <p> Do not use these files or any elements for commercial work . Do notresell any of these files or elements . Do not distribute these files . They are for you , nobody else . Do not print these files and sell them . <p> I cant stress it enough to abide by these simple rules . These files are made available to folks who would like a deeper understanding of Photoshop and Illustrator , how I arrange elements to achieve the effects I do , and for a launchpad for personal experimentation and visual exploration . In short , I want people to learn from these files and have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in hopes of making a buck . So , by purchasing and downloading these Photoshop and Illustrator files you are agreeing with these 4 points . Cool ? <p> So , swing on over to the Signalnoise Store and place an order as you normally would . But instead of receiving something in the mail , you will get an instant download . Hope you have lots of fun playing with the elements I 'm making available , and remember to post your creations to the newly formed Signalnoise Flickr group . Let 's get this giant collaboration going , kids . <p> I 'm really excited to announce that the awesome team over at Armada Skis have launched their 2010/11 product line , which includes a set of skis I designed . Shown above are my Halo : AR Series skis now available through Armada or other ski product distributors . here 's some product information straight from Armada : <p> " Creative application of EST Park Rocker to a park-specific chassis creates the next generation ski for carving between transitions , buttering off them , and floating beyond them . Stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails , the Halo slaughters the park . Patented . " <p> This is the first time I have attempted to design something like this , and it was a lot of fun and quite the challenge . Being used to creating posters that typically have normal proportions , having to change up my process to allow for something so long and thin was certainly a different ordeal . Lots of fun was had , and the gang at Armada were great to work with . <p> Skratch Bastid provided the tunes for the entire evening . He put on an amazing show . <p> On April 25th at Resistor Gallery in Toronto I had my very first art show entitled Broadcast : The art of James White where I displayed 13 of my works . It was a great time preparing all of the little things that come along with such an endeavor , and I 'm happy to say I hit no snags along the way . The folks at Resistor , namely Kim and Ron were excellent to deal with and I owe them both a huge thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make my posters a bit different for this unique occasion , I decided to get the designs printed to canvas . They were printed in Toronto and shipped directly to the gallery , so I did n't  actually see them until I arrived and set about hanging them . A rather reckless method of going about this thing , but I was ecstatic when I saw the quality of printing . I had never seen my work on canvas and the texture breathed new life into my work , not at all what I was expecting . <p> The doors opened at 7pm and I was very happy to see a constantly changing crowd as the night went on . I saw the faces of old friends and industry colleagues , and had the pleasure of meeting a tonne of new people who came by . All in all , a wonderful evening which found me quite overwhelmed with support . Thanks so much to everyone who made the time to come by , it is greatly appreciated ! <p> I would like to pass on a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick was nice enough to create the excellent retro Signalnoise logo animation which looped on the television screens all evening , it looked like something out of the 70s . You rock , Nick ! Check it out : <p> Another massive thank-you to the ever-talented Skratch Bastid for providing the killer jams throughout the evening . He kept the mood and atmosphere super fun with his musical stylings , as well as put on one hell of a turntable show later on . He even catered to my one ridiculous request by playing some Iron Maiden . Nobody can stop you , Skratch ! <p> Last but not least , big thanks to my pal Chris Toms for snapping a tonne of photos throughout the evening , some of which you will see in this post . Thanks Chris ! <p> If you missed the opening reception , my work will remain on display until May 25th at Resistor Gallery , 284 College Street in Toronto . <p> The next couple of weeks are going to be really busy and exciting as I prepare for a couple of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As you can see by the poster above , I will be having my first official art show on April 25th at Resistor Gallery in Toronto .

I 've never done canvas prints before , and will only be doing one of each for the show . Once they 're gone , they 're gone . The show is called Broadcast , same name as my online design discussions . Here are the details : <p> On top of that , the art show will be taking place on the first day of FITC Toronto where I will also be doing a presentation entitled Back to the Future on the morning of April 25th at 10am . My talk will involve some inspirational designs from the past and present , a showcase of my work , a short technical section where I walk through one of my process , some of the online tools I use to get my work out there , and a small advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I hope you can make it . <p> I 'm looking forward to these two Signalnoise events , and have been for the past few months as I made the necessary preparations . The Broadcast poster above will also be available once I get some posters printed in the next week or so . <p> Looking forward to meeting all those who attend : ) See you soon , Toronto ! <p> In addition:FITC Toronto is also holding a gallery opening entitled Barricade at Function 13 on April 25th featuring the work of James Paterson , James Braithwaite and Jeremy Felker , 156 Augusta Avenue . Two cool events on the same night , Toronto ! <p> Here is the poster design for the upcoming FITC Awards Party taking place on Monday , April 26 during the conference . My good pal Chris Toms and programming ninja Steven Sacks will be doing a DJ stint at the party , and we thought it would be fun to create a Signalnoise poster as a bit of fun promotion . As it turns out , this design will be landing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading to the conference keep an eye out . <p> Like some of my recent designs , the inspiration for this one was taken from 80s metal . I wanted to develop a poster that was simply over the top , beat-up , maybe a little sun-bleached , something that might reside on the wall of a rocker kid in 1985 or a tour poster for Judas Priest . If you grew up in that era , you know what I 'm talking about . After doing some research , I decided the evil knight was the way to go which was pieced together using a number of armor shots . <p> I will be doing a small print run of this design to be available at the conference via myself , Chris and Steven . Ill nail down the details soon to see how we can get these into peoples hands . <p> The kind crew over at Design Informer asked me to participate in their latest installment of Ask the Expert , where Jad Limcaco and I discussed all things art , design , inspiration and technique . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing examples . <p> To kick off the new year in form , the kind folks over at the Tuts+ Network asked me to design a commemorative 2010 poster . I am always in support of those people and websites who help out designers and developers on all levels , and the team over at the Tuts+ camp constantly exhaust themselves . They run VectorTuts , NetTuts , AudioTuts , the mighty PsdTuts and a plethora of other art and tech sites . So of course , I jumped at the opportunity to help out such an admirable bunch . <p> Additionally , Tuts+ are having a giveaway on their site where you could win one of 10 copies of the 2010 poster . Swing over to the Tuts+ 2010 contest post to see all the information . I created a wallpaper set of the design to download for your computer or iPhone , all of which are available on their website . <p> I love having an open-ended ticket to create a design , which was exactly what the team requested of me so long as it said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications from the 70s and 80s I took some heavy inspiration from Omni magazine covers . Omni had a way of creating interesting yet vague imagery , something that left a lot to the imagination . I wanted to strike that vibe for the Tuts+ crew , I even modeled the type after Omnis title treatment . <p> Initially , the design did n't  come together as quickly as I thought it would and the original attempts had me on a completely different course of action . Check out these early type-based versions : <p> I decided to ditch the entire concept and start from scratch , I wanted to do something more striking than a stylized number . I went back to the sketch phase and started working out another concept , and one involved an exploding astronaut which later became the Abduzeedo anniversary poster . A big thanks to Sean Hodge over at the Tuts+ Network for being so cool as I fumbled about with my concepts in my search for the right one . You rule , man ! <p> Swing on over to the post on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorative posters , and why not grab some wallpapers while you 're at it . Happy New Year ! <p> Here is a 2-page spread I created for the kind folks over at Computer Arts Projects magazine , included in issue #131 . Every issue of the mag contains the spread where different designers and artists use supplied phrases to create their own piece . I decided to make mine look like a mess of stickers , complete with little vector designs hidden amongst the fray . <p> The little round designs came from raiding my vector archives , its amazing how much you can amass over the course of a few years . You can see the full piece in a larger size right here . 
@@121792319 @10792319/ <p> Rarely do I use my blog for any sort of activism , but something came to light recently and I 'm having a hard time keeping quiet about it . <p> Earlier today , Abduzeedo posted this article about an incident that happened last week . A polite outline ( as expected from Abduzeedo ) can be found explaining- what happened and how they dealt with it , but let me highlight the section that rubbed me the wrong way <p> " We featured a beautiful photo in a post , giving full credit and linking back to the photographer and his work . We loved his work , it was on 500px and featured all options of sharing including on Pinterest , Facebook , Twitter and even an Embed Code . Maybe too used to the idea of sharing and fair usage , we included his image . <p> Unfortunately , we received a series of requests , like removing the content , which we did right away , a demand for public apology , which we more than happily did on the same blog post and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our blog . Our one and only goal was to share what inspired us with others . We are truly sorry . " <p> Right , so Abduzeedo shared a photo- in an inspiration round-up ( with credit and link ) and he wanted it removed . Fair enough , we all have final say when its our artwork in question and he has every right to request removal . He wanted a public apology . Kinda weird given there was no damage done , but alright . And of course , Abduzeedo obliged . <p> Then I read the part about the penalty fee that 's when I got uneasy . As far as I can tell , a " penalty fee " means a demand for monetary compensation . A fee for sharing a photo with full credit ? Abduzeedo never claimed ownership of the photo , nor did they re-sell the image . Confused , I clicked on the link to where the photo is housed , and arrived here on 500px . Let me draw your attention to the giant social share buttons in the upper right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embed the photo in your site . See where I 'm going with this ? <p> Now , let 's have a look at what 500px has on their About page I circled a pretty key word . <p> As I said earlier , we all have final say when it comes to our artwork , but this raises some important questions if one does not want their photos shared , then why would one put them on a site BUILT for sharing then attack someone who shares them ? Are these penalty fees demanded from everyone who shares a photo on Pinterest ? Facebook ? Twitter ? Ffffound ? Tumblr ? Where exactly do we draw the line on what sharing is acceptable and what is n't ? <p> Rarely do I use the Signalnoise platform in this manner , but I cant sit idle and watch this kind of thing happen especially to a site which has done nothing but foster creativity and inspiration for the design community for 7 years . Designers depend on sharing in order to spread work across the web , whether its for promotion or inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Am I coming to the defence of Abduzeedo ? Of course . But there 's a bigger issue here , the core idea of sharing . <p> I urge you to discuss your feelings and views , because man , I really think this needs to be discussed . The louder the better . <p> To say its been a busy year would be a complete understatement . 2013 had , by a wide margin , the most travel Ive ever done in my life . The Signalnoise World Tour kicked off in February with a 26-hour journey to Manila and I have n't been sitting still since . The year went by so fast that I 'm stunned to be writing this post already . <p> This year brought with it FAR too many wonderful meetings , memories , laughs and awesome times that I can not possibly list them all in this meagre blog post . I 'm not even going to try , man . <p> But this post DOES serve a very important purpose a GIANT THANK-YOU to everyone responsible for all the killer events I attended and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider me to take your stage , let alone fly me from Dartmouth to hang out and tell stories . You are held in the highest regard . <p> And finally , another mega thanks to everyone who attended the events , and hung around long enough to see me speak . Every audience was so energetic and inspiring it made telling my little story a complete pleasure . So many of you hung out after events for drinks and laughs , the best thing a guy far from home can ask for . <p> Thus concludes the Signalnoise World Tour 2013 . Hope to see you in 2014 as I start announcing new speaking dates soon . <p> A little while ago I posted the Creative Spark documentary Lynda shot here in my studio , introducing me and my work . Well , while the crew was here ( and seeing my silly passion for illustrating wrestlers ) they decided to shoot another piece focusing on my process . So here 's the result , the Start to Finish of my Undertaker illustration . <p> Beware : I say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My limited vocabulary really shines . <p> This is the first time I let anyone step into my space to record my process . I 've had people request Signalnoise tutorials a lot over the years , but I do n't  believe in teaching through " Push this button , now push that button " methods . So when Lynda brought up the idea of filming me in action , it was a great opportunity to discuss the nuts and bolts of my process while not being a typical- " paint by numbers " thing . I 'm a fundamentals guy , so you 'll see that there are n't  any fancy tricks or secret ingredients in my work . <p> This is the kind of stuff I do by myself in my office just making it up as I go along .

Instead , I just put out a tweet to see what my followers might have to say on the topic . <p> I was asked quite a bit last night what my thoughts were on this revision , so I decided to form it into a blog post because it seems the conversation is pretty heated , and ultimately 1-sided . The typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative , especially on the internet . Everyone thinks their opinion/idea is better than the one executed , so it quickly becomes a pissing match to see who can hate it the most using the most profanity . While at the same time , accomplishing nothing . I refer you to the Bleeding Cool comments . <p> My first reaction was confusion as I did n't  feel DC really needed to pursue an identity redesign considering they launched their previous logo only in 2005 . It was met with mixed reviews , I dished out a few myself , but ultimately the logo did a great job of capturing youthful excitement ( we ARE talking comic books here ) and the animated version in their movie intro credits looked great . I was completely blindsided by yesterdays launch , and woke up today with the same confused feeling . In short , why the redesign and the departure from their established legacy ? here 's the DC Comics logo history : <p> The new logo is quite nice . Combination of the D unveiling the C is pretty clever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , but I can see what they were going for and an animated version for their movies might look pretty good . I would love to see a process piece written to show how they arrived at this conclusion , and what designs may have went unused . <p> I was recently having a cold one with my pal Dave Howlett who works at Strange Adventures , and he knows more about ( and loves ) comics more than anyone I know . He brought up that DC was looking to add more adult material to their comics because their audience had gotten older , ie. our generation of 30-somethings . But there are two problems here : 1 ) they would be completely disregarding the youth market who had supported them for decades , plus 2 ) they are turning off the longtime fans with all these sweeping changes to their beloved and familiar characters . This idea echoes in the new logo the kids are n't  going to notice it , and the old-school fans might feel abandoned . <p> Its a confusing move that has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Addition : DC has n't  made it clear exactly where this logo will be used . Of all my reading today , details have been a bit scarce . If anyone has any info , feel free to post . <p> The Heidelberg tried to literally define " hot pink " with this small mishap . <p> Here is a little video I cut together after visiting Bounty Print- this morning to sign-off on my DRIVE poster . They fired up the Heidelberg press when I was there so I shot a bit of footage . Amazing to see this beast of a press firing off my poster . The thing is bigger than my house . <p> The DRIVE poster launches on January 19 , one week from today . Details here . <p> I 'm being hit from all sides this past week regarding information on my DRIVE poster . Most of the emails , tweets and Facebook notes are asking the same questions so an official update on the blog is in order to get the information out there on all fronts . So , here 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently being set up over at Bounty Print in Halifax on their giant 6-colour Heidleberg press . They will be printed at 22 ? x 28 ? on Starbrite Velvet 80lb cover . Additionally , There will be a very small run of 24 ? x 36 ? oversized DRIVE posters available on semi-gloss poster stock . If you are looking at getting one of these ones on launch day I urge you to act fast as the numbers will be very low . <p> The Signalnoise Store will be activated on launch day to purchase the DRIVE posters . The absolute best way to get a head start is to follow my Twitter , as I will be posting the news as soon as they are available . To dispel any rumours , there is no lottery and the DRIVE posters will be available first come , first served . Mark your calendars . <p> If you have any questions , I urge you to ask via the comments on this post and I will update with any details needed . A huge thanks for all the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signalnoise poster launch to date and the response so far has been amazing . 226304 @qwx1086304 
@@121792322 @10792322/ <p> Before heading off to FITC Toronto last month with my pal Chris Toms , I spent some time designing business cards for us to distribute during the event . Chris was in the process of putting his photography site together and asked if I 'd be interested in designing the logo . <p> The little badass radish was born out of a combination of vegetation , tribal masks , Playmobil and Super Mario Bros . He needed something that would sit nicely on his site , and look great on a shirt , plus I 'm a sucker for funny little characters like this . <p> Its been a little while since I talked about what personal projects I have been working on , so I wanted to dedicate a post to just that . I 've had a few freelance gigs and travel plans on the go over the past month or so which left me with little time to flush out my own work , but the ideas have been spinning and I 'm excited to be at a point where I can talk about what 's coming up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Zachary Lieberman and Golan Levin during their presentation Art , Gesture , Computation , Framework . The quote was repeated throughout other presentations during the event : <p> " D.I.Y . ( Do It Yourself ) is great , but I prefer D.I.W.O. which means Do It With Others . " <p> Great point there . Since the event I have been trying to map out a project where others can dissect from what I do , and learn by example . A tricky task given my main outlet of contact with the creative community is via the web . <p> So I have begun work on something I 'm really excited to get out there , entitled The Signalnoise Source : Vol. 1 . This is a DVD release I have been working on over the past bit and will contain around 10 PSD files of compositions ( and maybe a few other goodies ) at 100dpi with all layers and effects intact for users to see how I go about building my work . My poster PSDs will not be included , the files will be custom-made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking around the hard drive . A couple of examples can be seen above . <p> The sole purpose of The Signalnoise Source DVD set is to help others , its as simple as that . I 'm going to try and get as much cool stuff as I can on there , as this is something I 've never had the opportunity to pursue before . The price tag is still up in there air as yet . <p> Stay tuned as I continue work on this , I 'll keep you posted and I cant wait to get this into the Signalnoise Store , and furthermore into peoples hands . <p> Beautifully rendered ship and space scenes by the talented John Berkley . Really enjoying Johns painterly style , and how he manages to sneak in so many vibrant colors into the ships face , blasters and thrusters.I would love to have that second image hanging on my wall . <p> I was unable to find an official site for John , but check out this massive gallery . Amazing . <p> I was recently contacted by the minds behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic spice to their newly redesigned Gadgets website . The guys wanted something that would hit the retro vibe while keeping a very modern technological feel . <p> The postcard says it all . I 'm currently on vacation in sunny Orlando enjoying some sunshine and theme parks I 've only seen on television . Visited Universal Studios and Disneyworld thus far , both of hich were awesome , too many great rides and attractions to mention at this point ( although the Hulk coaster at Universal rocks it ) . Might post some photos upon my return , I sure have some funny ones . <p> Things will be back in full swing on Signalnoise.com next week . Hope everyone is well . 
@@121792323 @10792323/ <p> This poster was an odyssey within itself . I immersed myself in 2001 : A Space Odyssey for a week , watching the film twice along with all the making of footage and documentaries , researching concept art and posters online , and doing a bunch of sketching . Even once I had a concept on the go , it changed a few times as I started building my elements . I wanted the poster to have a subtle touch , hit the theme of the film , yet still have a Signalnoise flavor . It was daunting to say the least . Here are a few previous versions and sketches . <p> One of my favorite design elements of 2001 are the planet edges with a rising sun , so I included a lot of arches and horizons in this one to mimic that concept . Played with a lot of symmetry as well , echoing the film . I wanted to shy away from any wild rainbow effects or showcasing HAL , those ideas seemed a bit too obvious . <p> All in all , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some posters made of this one soon . <p> Loved the old design better , at first , but then decided the new one kicks major ass . Love the air line , the " flattening " of the Neanderthals and the Astronaut . I would have gotten rid of the accordion pleats in the space suit , and the red dot . <p> Your design concept with HAL as the sun , sans the white silhouette , would be the best . The vector astronaut and " ultimate trip " line evokes an " off " sense of decade and makes it seem more like a poster for a retroactively designed Atari video game rather than a movie . The picture of Dave retains the idea without diluting it . The silhouette is extraneous . Your original concept , while abstract , retains the right feel . I think you lost it a little bit with your selected final design . <p> Nice poster mate : ) Very cool , Have you seen the artist Tomasz Opasinski , He does a lot of alternate Movie Poster designs that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you were gon na continue doing Movie Posters for yourself it could be a good resource to look at : ) Anyway , food for thought : D Great Design ! ! ! ! <p> Hey James , Great work again , I cant say that I have seen the film , but I would have liked to see the bottom of the main square blend into the bottom . Another note I love your sketches , even though they are just line strokes , and quick concepts I think they look fantastic <p> Thanks so much for all the lovely comments , everyone ! Seriously humbled , you have no idea . <p> There are a couple of points I wanted to reply to specifically regarding the design , some great points a few people brought up via the comments regarding elements of the design . Here we go : <p> " The ultimate trip " tagline A few people brought this up as being bad , but there 's a reason its in there and a bit of a story behind it . When 2001 was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a number of weeks . The posters sported the tagline " An epic drama of adventure and exploration " , which is pretty dry . After a few weeks , a resurgence of younger people started seeing the film for its psychedelic fantasy . . . it was more of a ride then a movie . The posters were changed to sport the slogan " The ultimate trip " to appeal to this younger hip audience who might " consume consumables " before the film . I find this story pretty funny , which is why I chose to include that slogan even though it is a bit stupid . <p> Symmetry I 'm planning on writing a post about my excessive ( and rather subconscious ) use of symmetry in my work , but wanted to reply directly to it here first . 2001 as a movie uses a lot of balanced shots and symmetry , Kubrick did this on purpose probably because it was a lot more difficult then a standard shot . I really wanted that idea to be echoed in this poster in particular so even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this case it was deliberate . . . not just preference . : ) <p> James there is no doubting the quality of work is certainly there . Thanks for sharing . It had to have been a blast getting this out of your system . But I must respectably say you tried way too hard on these . There is just too much going on . In your quest to tell a story , you went away from emotion and intrigue ( the main pillars of the film ) to in-your-face , I 'll hold your hand with obvious storytelling direction . Wheres the mystery ? The mystique ? The next problem is illustration-style silhouettes mixed in with photos just does n't  work in this context , no fault of your own . Oil and water here . Lastly , the image of Dave that you used is way too familiar , seen for years on all video and media ( http : //goo.gl/HLe5l ) and itd been best to use something way less familiar . An interesting still from the movie that we have n't immediately seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced when you try to honor what you love , it often gets distorted by too much of what 's right in front of you versus embracing the background noise of what makes the film work as seen through your style . <p> I agree , but it seems to have been a semi-official tagline for the movie , and Ive seen it in other posters for the film . It mightve helped drum up publicity in 1968 ( certainly a good year to employ that sort of phrasing ) but in 2011 , it just sounds dated and ridiculous to me.

Speaking of , he will be running Cal-Con at the shop this weekend where he s running all kinds of specials and cool events . <p> When I first got into the web industry back in 1998 , I instantly immersed myself in the- emerging- online art scene . I was constantly surfing- independent- design websites to see how these other kids were using new technologies to create online installations and new digital artwork . It was pioneering time . An amazing time . Even though I was n't onstage back then , I was in the bleachers cheering these people on as hard as I could . <p> The bloodline of this online art scene was the " news stream " portion of web portal sites . The place where people post brief snippets and links to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heap , the best place to find new stuff which was updated many times every day was the mighty Kaliber10000 , or K10k . <p> Now , you have to understand when this was . I was a young design punk at the age of 21 , and this is years before " blogs " existed so the spread of information was much slower than it is today . But K10k , man . If you wanted to have your finger on the pulse , you went there . I remember my palms sweating while waiting for their big redesign back in what , 2001 ? When me and my design buddies would hang out we were constantly saying " Did you see that link on K10k today ? " . That site saturated my life during that time . The boys even linked to a very early version of Signalnoise back in 2002 . I felt like a king . <p> You could say sites like K10k paved the way for things like Twitter hell , Twitter is basically a networked K10k newsfeed . But as time went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and the blogosphere took over . The guys started up their own company , Cuban Council . <p> But I wanted to take a moment to tip the Signalnoise hat to K10k , which recently and proudly closed its doors . What Michael , Toke and Per did was extremely important to the web as a whole . But from personal experience I probably never would have registered Signalnoise.com back in 1999 had I not been reading K10k everyday . I would n't have been chasing a dream of creating digital art .

See , back in elementary school me and a few buddies took it upon ourselves to start our own wrestling federations .

Needless to say , I snapped up my tickets real quick and am stoked to see Kevin speak once again . <p> He put out on his Twitter a little while ago that he was looking for a Canadian artist to design the tour poster . Being a long time fan of the guy , I had to give it a shot . That 's my poster above . Me and my pal Jerko used to watch the hell out of the CLERKS Animated Series back in the day , and I always liked the character designs from the show . My Jay and Bob are influenced by that style , with my own interpretation thrown into the mix . <p> Here are a few scans of doodles before I jumped into Illustrator .

Check out the full details right here . <p> Ive been attending FITC events for the last 3 years , and have had the opportunity to speak twice in Toronto . I 've gotten to know much of the people behind the event as well as friends whom I only see at FITC . I look forward to my annual trek to Toronto each year and I hope to attend the other events around the globe at some point . <p> While attending FITC Toronto 2010 in May of this year , I was approached by my pal Shawn Pucknell ( the Grand Poobah of FITC ) to develop the creative for the following years event , FITC Toronto 2012 . I 've spoken at FITC twice so far and being a huge fan of the event and the entire crew behind it , I jumped at the opportunity to work with my friends . Shawn gave me creative freedom to develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase at the event next year . I started looking at everything including the FITC identity which , at the time , had no idea if it would be used or not . <p> Here are a couple of snips as I worked on the identity , but you can check out the full FITC Logo Process over on Web Design Wall . All kinds of behind-the-scenes images and babbling . Be sure to check it out . <p> I 'm super proud to have been able to work with my pals at FITC , and I 'll see you all at FITC Toronto 2012 next April ! <p> I came across these lovely wine country travel posters a little while back and had to post . <p> Other than knowing they were designed by Hatch in San Fran , I really know nothing else about them . They were for sale at some point through SFMOMA , but I could n't find a trace in their store . Even had a hard time finding larger versions online , so please pardon the smaller scale . 226304 @qwx1086304 <p> So here 's the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 80s and 90s I was a die hard Toronto Blue Jays fan . From the classic line-up of Bell , Gruber and Moseby right up until they won back-to-back World Series in 92 and 93 , I was cheering for my Jays . And you know what a big part of that was ? The logo which theyve used since 77 . <p> But in the late 90s it seemed the norm to " re-brand " sports teams like nuts . It drove me crazy because so many of the classic logos were perfectly sound without need of a re-design AND all sports team logos started looking the same . Some kind of angry animal or whatever busting through a wall . No respect for the legacy of the team just something the marketing people would say " looks cool " . Screw you . <p> My Jays were no different . In 97 they revised the classic logo which made the Jay look over-weight , like he ate too many of them ballpark franks after the World Series wins . Then in 2003 geez , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Rangers ? A maple leaf tattoo on his " bicep " ? Ugh . <p> And then in 2004 , full-on generic angry blue jay logo complete with the beveled " Jays " hunk o turd . Zero reference to 27 years of the clubs history . Looks like every other logo across 3 sports in North America . Being a longtime fan and a designer , this was a- disappointing- reveal when it happened . <p> In all honesty , I lost track of my Jays in 2004 mostly because the identity of the team , to me , was totally stripped .

Kellys redesign speaks on that level . <p> I posted the original Tinker Toys can here as well , which I believe is the one I had as a kid . I love the comparison of the old to Kellys . Certain harmony there . I dig it . <p> PS . I remember that can being super hard to open when I was 5 . Had to get dad to open it all the time .

Back in the 1990s , Kris cut his teeth painting powerful covers for the black metal scene in Europe , developing heavy atmospheric scenes which perfectly captured the essence of the genre . I had seen Kris work before as I explored black metal , but it was n't until the most recent issue of Juxtapoz ( issue 105 ) that he was brought to my full attention . Here is the very suitable introduction to the interview : <p> " What is this work ? The cover in its tight , crude brilliance envelopes me in a horrific cloak , that sort of dark landscape that provokes the heart to pump faster . Damn , its another masterpiece by Belgian artist Kris Verwimp , who seems to continually compose the ideal scenarios for this genre of powerful music . "

Great broadcast with some great advice . <p> We then bounced over to Nick Campbell with his GSG Live Cast where he had a focus on design and design-related topics .

Ive been in touch with Fabio for about 2 and a half years as we teamed up on a few giveaways and other fun blog collaborations , so it was awesome to finally hang out with the dude and shake his hand . He s just as cool as you would think and we had a great time having a few drinks and talkin blogs . <p> I also got to see Scott Hansen , ISO50 speak for the second time . He made some adjustments to his presentation this time around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poster in Photoshop .

To top it off , he performed as Tycho at one of the FITC after partys where I got to hang out backstage with Scott and Dusty Brown ( whom I only knew through Scotts posters ) . It was a great time . <p> Following their talks I had the pleasure of meeting a few of my other art &amp; design heroes such as Erik Natzke and Robert Hodgin . Eriks presentation was beautiful , where he took us through his progression as a code-driven artist chronologically , showing us how one idea led to another and how his he ended up being hired by big clients for the work he sees as " play " .

Brendan is always entertaining to watch and manages to get some really good advice into his delivery as well . He talked briefly about the products his company produces , and described it as " We wanted to be more in control of our own destinies , rather then at the whim of a budget . " A good point there . He showed us a few of the projects he and his company worked on over the past while , and previewed his new iPhone app , the Accidental News Explorer . <p> In conclusion , FITC always delivers on quality speakers and great networking opportunities to meet those you look up to and make new friends .

As I mentioned in a previous post , I will have some Signalnoise t-shirts and goodies available during the event , be sure to follow my Twitter to see when I will be getting these into peoples hands . <p> Things might be a little slow on the blog this week , depending on how much time I have during the many fun events to keep things updating . If time is short , I will be sure to update everyone upon my return home . <p> Last night while I was goofing around Facebook I stumbled across a link my buddy Ben sent to my buddy Dave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this link in particular dealt with one of my favorite comic illustrators , Frank Quitely ( We3 , All Star Superman ) .

All of this was done using his giant Wacom Cintiq and Photoshop . <p> " Quitely demonstrates how he uses his Cintiq to improve his workflow with traditional media and takes us through some of the preliminary steps in creating a cover for the relaunch of T.H.U.N.D.E.R .

I 'm a big dork when it comes to " making of " features so I adequately lost it seeing Quitely fire around a digital format with a tablet .

My pal Justin Maller even showed up to hang this time around . <p> I will be leaving on Monday to attend FITC San Francisco so there will be no broadcast next Thursday , but I 'll be back the following week with some stories .

I toyed with the idea of putting in the chrome Superman symbol from the Bob Peak poster , but could n't make it look right . Even messed with a " Fortress of Solitude creating the Superman logo " like an Olly Moss piece , but I did n't  dig it .

I needed these things nailed down before I got to the hotel in Madison WI so I had very few guesses to make . I had basically 1 day in the hotel to build the entire poster . Yikes . <p> After I felt everything was sort of in place , especially after roughing that sketch on the left I opened Illustrator and got to it .

You guys rule for putting up with me . <p> Initial concept . I scrapped this direction after 12 hours of work . <p> And seen above is the initial idea I started to build . 12 hours of digital painting . I got to the point where the image looked forced .

SUPER opens this Friday in Newcastle , Australia at Curve Gallery .

So it was kindly reminded to me , and I decided to tackle this new image using a horse as the model . <p> I do n't  have any original photos of horses at my disposal , so I had to use some found photography to help out with the piece .

This week I was talking about sketching and roughing up concepts . I get asked a lot if designers need to know how to draw to do their job better , which is always difficult to answer .

@@121792342 @10792342/ <p> Deadlines have been packed throughout the last 2 weeks so my illustration output has slowed a bit . But , here is a batch of the latest . As usual , its a mixed bag . The Hubble Space Telescope , The Bride from KILL BILL and my main man RoboCop . <p> That grumpy looking lumberjack was created for my pal Jerko . We were having a few cold ones the other night and he told me about this story he was working on , hinging on something from an old horror magazine . Jerko loves his horror . I cracked out the sketchbook and we worked up a doodle . That 's my take on the main character , WeirdBeard . <p> Things have been moving on the illustration front , and my output ended up landing me a really cool client gig . Banged out 3 illustrations for none other than the Canon camera company last week . Once I get the- green light- I 'll post them up . Super fun . <p> Big thanks to my pal Andy Cotnam for the helpful advice on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past year , you may have come across several posters that I designed for my favorite movies . I created pieces for DRIVE , BLADE RUNNER , THE THING , MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE , INDIANA JONES , TERMINATOR 2 and some others , all of which can be found in my portfolio . I made it my mission to break into the alternative art movie poster industry , but unfortunately only 2 posters were officially printed and offered for sale . The others remained in legal limbo , personal development , self-initiated projects whatever you want to call it . <p> Aside from what was released online I did a lot of work behind the scenes developing ideas and visuals for many of my favorite movies . I never had permission , I designed them merely for my own enjoyment and practise . Most are thumbnails in my sketchbook while others I pushed to a digital sketch . Seen above are 5 posters that never got out of the concept phase . Very few people have seen these up until now . The Signalnoise movie posters that werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format , I mock things up in Photoshop to experiment with the composition , colours and texture . Normally I cobble together found photos and movie stills as reference , then " paint " the entire poster from scratch . Ideas tend to shift and change as I go , which is why you 'll see differences between the ink sketches and the digital mock-ups above . <p> These concepts have been sitting on my computer for months , figured I 'd post them . And the thing is , this is n't all of them so you might see a Part II to this post in the future . <p> Ive been creating illustrations in this style for about a month now , a kind of ongoing experiment of forcing myself into a new process . I was hanging out with some friends last week and one of the bits of feedback I got on the new work was " create some original material " . As in , not something attached to a franchise . Good point there , so I got at it . <p> here 's an illustration titled The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who witnesses a big meteor falling to earth . Simple little idea . Maybe the start of a story ? Who knows . <p> Ive been getting a lot of people asking what software I 'm using to make these things , so seen above are 3 versions of the illustration . The original concept from my sketchbook , the straight vectors in Illustrator , then my final in Photoshop . Should give you a rough idea of how I build up the illustrations . <p> If you know me at all , you 'll also know that I do n't  discuss my Help Japan poster very often . Of all my posters and designs it was the one that reached the furthest , was seen by the widest audience , and- galvanized- charitable funds far above my expectation . This all happened 2 years ago and its taken me this long to approach the subject- publicly , and personally . <p> I create lots of stuff , the size of my portfolio is proof of that . So when something happens where I think my creative efforts may help , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of March 11 , 2011 when news reached me about what happened in Japan . I made something to raise money , much the same as the ladies in the seniors home who held a bake sale around the corner from my house . I 'd sell my poster via my online store and donate the proceeds to the Canadian Red Cross . A simple little idea , I thought . So I got started . <p> Within an hour my poster went viral . <p> I started getting- phone calls- from the- New York Times- and other big publications. - The response was intimidatingly positive as I started setting up the print run , ordering shipping supplies and enlisting friends to help me with all the work . A LOT of work , hundreds of tubes to be packed , processed and shipped but it was definitely worth it given the cause . I could n't believe it . <p> Then the unexpected happened . Even if you have the best intentions possible , sometimes things can come out of left field to give you a knock . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it breaches the bubble of personal audience and goes out to the general online public , which exposes you to not only the positive , but to the negative . Its no secret that the negative screams louder than the positive , especially with the anonymity of the internet . This was a harsh reality hit me head-on . <p> Each morning during my time packing , shipping , corresponding and donating I was- receiving- emails and blog comments from those who took it upon themselves to tell me I was doing something horrible . The remarks were almost- frightening , ranging from harsh design critiques , cultural differences and personal attacks on my character . They 're all still live here and here , if you need some context . For a time I was even scared of answering my own phone . For a freelancer working alone out of a small home office , this wasnt easy to deal with in the least . But I kept forcing the bigger picture into my head : the good cause . <p> This is when Fast Company decided to rear its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? , John Pavlus took it upon himself to voice his opinion about my- charitable- endeavour . It should be noted right away that neither Fast Company , nor John himself , contacted me for a statement prior to posting the article on their very well-travelled website . A pretty key mis-step in- journalism- I would well imagine , especially given the gravity of the topic at hand . Unknown to anyone but myself ( and close friends ) , this article alone caused the most damage to me and my campaign , igniting not only a new round of harsh emails and comments but this time , from within the design community . A field I love and respect . This alone caused me to almost shut down the campaign . <p> Despite all of this , the campaign was seen through and raised around $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross as I shipped posters out of my basement . I said earlier , far and above the original little idea . <p> So , why am I writing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay-sayers and its certainly not an attempt to garner sympathy or encouragement ( seriously , please withhold comments of that nature , guys ) . Ive been running this blog for 5 years and Ive always felt a certain responsibility to my audience ( specifically designers ) to discuss the industry through experience , as transparently as possible . We all have ups and downs , and we all have stories surrounding them . My reasons are 2-fold <p> First , be careful . If your main goal is for something to " go viral " in whatever form , be careful . Your work will be reaching a much wider audience and in some cases people wont think twice about voicing harsh opinion several times over to a complete stranger . Growing a thick skin only comes through experience . Even though you have the best intentions , your truth might get contorted and thrown under the bus . So be careful . <p> And second , stick it out . If you are doing something with nothing but the best intentions do NOT let those people stop you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites . If you 're doing what you believe in , and you 're doing it for others do n't  let an elusive negative force stop you , even if it sticks with you well after the fact . <p> 2 years later , I 'm thinking hard on all this stuff and despite the harsh language directed toward me , my design and my campaign , I would n't have done it any differently . <p> More and more and more illustrations . Seen here are 3 more completed over the last few days : the TARDIS from Doctor Who , Supermans nemesis Darkseid and video game star Mega Man . A- motley- crew of subject matter . I went to visit my pal Ben Jeddrie the other day and he gave me a list of stuff I should illustrate , which is where the TARDIS and Darkseid came from . Good ideas . <p> I posted a couple of split images to show what my illustrations were based on . I wanted the Darkseid illustration to directly reference a drawing by creator Jack Kirby because I did n't  want some bullcrap " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man . My pal Lucas requested that one and the last thing we wanted was some manga lookin thing , so we went straight to the original 8-bit . <p> As always , best way to see these things as I make them are via Instagram and Facebook . Big thanks for the response and feedback everyone , the help and encouragement means the world to me . More to come <p> Yet another illustration completed today , my favorite vehicle from the STAR WARS franchise : the TIE Fighter . After putting some hours in on the Clint illustration , I wanted to relax and make something with some logical surfaces and design . <p> A lot of people are asking me what the destination and goal is of these illustrations , and in all honesty I do n't  know . This new exploration was born out of the urge to create different material , at least different for me , and it was only meant to be an- exercise . I had no idea the online response would have been so loud , completely unexpected given this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So now I 'm in a place where I 'm starting to ponder a method of getting these out there to interested parties . Prints ? A book ? I 've had some interesting ideas sent my way from reputable sources , but still undecided . Guess well see what happens as I continue . <p> As always , if you want to see these as I make them , Instagram and Facebook is the place to be . <p> I 've been- consciously- putting off doing a " person " piece in this new style , focusing more on boxy shapes , robots and characters . But after doing the DRIVE illustration that featured a human hand , I decided it was time to tackle a face . Even bigger than that , capturing likeness . Yikes . In a low-poly , painterly style ? Yeah right . So last night I found some photos refs and dove in . <p> Seen here is my illustration of good ol Clint in his classic role of the Man with No Name . Lots of trial and error in this one as I built all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picassos Cubism into the fold ( unintentionally ) . Still in the experimental phase of this illustration stuff , but its getting somewhere interesting . <p> Heres 2 more recent illustrations : a Cylon from the old BATTLESTAR GALACTICA show and the hammer from DRIVE . These are pretty opposite in their content , one being really simple and the other having a ton of surfaces to play with . <p> Ive been burning these things out over the last week and posting them all on my Instagram and Facebook as soon as their done . As I said before , the amount of helpful feedback has been wonderful as I find my way around this new stylistic turf . Big thanks everyone . <p> I 'm sure you 'll be seeing more illustrations really soon as I continue

That book has been a constant source of inspiration and Moebius work was never far from my radar after that . <p> Instead of putting together a big post with a ton of his art , instead I scanned in my favorite piece from the book , created by Moebius in 1986 . I do n't  know what its called or what it was produced for , but to me this piece captures perfectly the calmness and other-worldly- nature often present in Moebius work .

There are zillions of Mario games out there but I wanted to only show the main titles that advanced his design , so do n't  get on me for omitting Paper Mario or the RPG , you nerds . <p> So this one is for you , Mario .

We reached the goal a couple of weeks ago but I 'm still running hard as I can toward the finishing line as the more we raise , the more cards I can move into production straight away . Down to the crunch ! <p> So this afternoon , Tuesday the 7th at 2pm EST there will be a special GUM CARDS live broadcast . Since the project launched quite a lot has happened as I created more cards and materials to support the GUM CARDS experience , so the broadcast today will serve as a big summarization on the last month cover all the details . Along with the story , I 'll discuss the print process ramp-up and a few other fun ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all the formalities , I 'll open the floor to a Q&amp;A session with the audience . Possible laughs ! <p> Since I came up with the GUM CARDS idea Ive been thinking about the myriad of stuff I wanted to design around it to make the entire experience richer . One of the things I wanted to create was an advertisement as if it appeared on the back of a comic book in 1986 . So I made one , inspired by old Lego and Nintendo- advertisements- from when I was a kid . Big names . Small cards . <p> So a bit of news . The clock is ticking down to the end of the GUM CARDS Indiegogo fundraising . As of next Wednesday it will be done , - effectively- wrapping up phase one of the project . So if you were planning on pledging but have n't gotten around to it yet , time is running short . Cut in line to secure your GUM CARDS . <h> GUM CARDS Live Broadcast <p> A lot has been happening since I kicked off the GUM CARDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal has been met and production has begun . But the easiest way to discuss all of this stuff is live . So this coming Tuesday ( the 7th ) I 'll be doing a second special GUM CARDS SNBC broadcast discussing everything about the project . This will be the day before the funding period ends , so if you want to know more about GUM CARDS be sure to tune in live . I 'll tell stories , show some goodies and answer questions live . <p> Once again , a big thanks to everyone who has supported and encouraged the project . You have all made this experience incredible , and were just at the beginning . 
@@121792365 @10792365/ <h> Horse composite <p> Earlier this week I was asked by two people if I ever considered creating a piece using an animal as a subject . The thought had occured to me earlier in the project , but the notion dropped out of my head soon after as I got swept up in illustrating humans and their skulls . So it was kindly reminded to me , and I decided to tackle this new image using a horse as the model . <p> I do n't  have any original photos of horses at my disposal , so I had to use some found photography to help out with the piece . Then I had to track down some references for horse skulls and spines which turned into quite the challenge on its own . Once I got everything I needed , the real fun started as I tried to draw the contours of an animal skull which made me feel like a fish out of water . I was midway through when I realized I had never attempted to draw a skull other then a homosapien , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a very rough time choosing colors and getting a level of contrast I was happy with . Even now , the piece looks less heavy then the others . This new image is a test piece in preparation to tackle the real thing at some point .

Necessary evil I understand , but I 'm a creative guy and my interests will always lie in making things . The craft of it all . So when I 'm forced to deal with taxes and forms and whatever else that takes away from my creating , it puts me in a quiet and pretty foul mood .

Call it therapy or whatever , but a lot of times my state of mind translates almost directly into my work . Couple that with getting into SONS OF ANARCHY recently and we end up with the Signalnoise Biker design .

@@121792370 @10792370/ <p> By now , the entire world has heard about Disney buying LucasFilm . The news dropped yesterday afternoon and seemed to have caught the entire world with their collective pants down . Collective pants ? Gross . Anyway , I was as surprised and confused as anyone . Universes collided . In all my life I never would have expected to see Vader and Mickey walking hand-in-hand . <p> As anticipated , the angry nerd kingdom of the world exploded onto the internet with all their fear and hatred regarding the news while everyone else scrambled to make some dumb meme . Pretty standard as nerds tend to knee-jerk whenever anything swoops too close to a franchise they enjoy . Are they wrong ? Not necessarily . Are they right ? Not really . And this comes from a lifelong Star Wars fan . I was born in 1977 , my blood is still 87% rancor . But at nerdy emotional times like this , maybe its a good time to step back and look at this thing with a wider- lens or with a weird slow-motion capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are business people . Like it or not , this deal made complete and total sense from a financial standpoint . Disney can make all kinds of Star Wars stuff in the coming years , and LucasFilm just made a ton of cash . Fandom does n't  factor into the numbers at this point . Sorry to be so cold ( remember , I love Star Wars too ) , but its a fact . Being " independent " is cool and hip , but when a company gets big this kind of stuff is viable and inevitable . <p> Let 's also look at Disneys track record over the last couple of years , with one major example . After Disney bought Marvel , much to the ( same ) chagrin of the nerd community , they put out some of the best hero movies that have hit the screen . Namely CAPTAIN AMERICA and THE AVENGERS . Imagine if LucasFilm was bought by the people who made CRANK or MEGASHARK . Ugh . Disney has around 100 years of movie making experience in 2D , 3D and live action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they own a lot of other companies does n't  mean they 're bad it actually means they 're good at what they do . Very good . <p> And finally , George Lucas is 68 , man . When the 9th Star Wars movie comes out in 2021 hell be 77 . That 's getting up there . Not to be grim , but when the head of a big company is- suddenly- not there it changes things . Just look at Apple . On the longterm Disney ( arguably ) might have longevity greater then that of LucasFilm when it comes to getting these last few movies done . That big and historic- infrastructure- brings with it a bit of comfort , yknow ? Bit of padding . <p> I know this post will cultivate some arguments and I would LOVE to hear your thoughts . But please keep in mind , this is not meant to be a staunch- defence- of Disney and everything it is . My main point is that our beloved Star Wars universe may have fallen into the right hands . Money and corporate arguments aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LucasFilm is good at that , and so is Disney . <p> I 'd much rather anticipate a nice team-up of movie-makers on a franchise I love than sit with a scowl on my face for the next 9 years . <p> A little while ago I ( virtually ) sat down with Shelby White- ( Twitter ) and Jeff Sheldon of Ugmonk ( Twitter ) to talk about the ins and outs of designer self promotion on Design Talk 3 . We covered all kinds of interesting topics dealing with the " to dos " and the " do nots " , plus some extra riffing . Real interesting these two guys , had a lot of fun hanging out and jawing . <p> If you did n't  view it live , check out the recorded version above . Big thanks to Shelby for having me on a second time. - Honored ! <p> The 1980s were wicked-awesome and the print ads of that decade were par for the course . They were playful and sophisticated , the focus trending toward less copy and more imagery . Ads often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large product shot bathed in a spectrum of color . Does n't  get much better than that . <p> After sifting through thousands of these 80s ads , the layouts and type choices can admittedly become quite predictable ; but they never become tiresome to me . Its true that we often romanticize the past , and that 's very possible what I 'm doing here , but I ca n't help but feel coming up with these ads thirty-some years ago was a lot of fun . I cant say I look forward to doing any ads in this day and age . <p> You have to admire the strong grid foundations these ads are constructed on ; so solid . Desktop publishing really did n't  make a strong push until the end of the decade , so I 'm assuming these ads were created using physical layouts .

Beautiful print job too . They will be available tonight at the art show , and the remainder will be sold in the Spoke Art Store on Monday . Swoop in quick if you want one . <p> In a few short weeks I 'll be making my way to Portland , Oregon for a big speaking event in conjunction with Spaceman Design ( Twitter ) and AIGA Portland . Starting to get real excited for this one . <p> And check out this poster . Dave Hardy over at Spaceman Design took it upon himself to design a gig poster for the big night . Not only that , he wanted to do it in the style of my Gum Cards . A tall task , those lines and curves can by tricky but he knocked it out of the park . Dave scooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to bring me to town . Then he designs this poster , complete with my Drive jacket . Amazing . Humbled . <p> I do a lot of drawing on my spare time , only a portion of which reaches the website , Twitter or what have you . But are a couple of original drawings I created of Arnold as the Terminator and Robert Patrick as T-1000 using good ol lead , ink and coloured pencils . Lots of fun blocking out time to sit at my drawing table to put these together . My fingertips are currently blue . <p> And here 's the thing , I 'm giving them away .

Sound good ? <p> In 2007 after the release of my first and only book , I was trying to figure out what the next logical step in my career was going to be . I mean my " personal " career . I was working at an agency at the time but worked feverishly on my own little projects outside of the office . My book kind of summed up everything I did in my twenties and put all those unfinished projects to rest . And for a bit more perspective , I registered Signalnoise.com in April of 1999 . I was flopping around like a fish on the wharf during those 8 years trying to find my artistic voice . Inspiration without direction . For downloadable evidence see the Signalnoise Graveyard- and the myriad of Signalnoise logos . <p> I was hanging out with my pal Chris Toms one evening when I decided to start a blog . Nothing profound since blogging had been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a blogging platform . Maybe this new direction would give me a reason to update my site with new work ? It was worth a shot . Within days Chris had me set up on his host and WordPress functionality was installed . On the evening of October 23rd , 2007 , I wrote my first meagre post aptly titled Signalnoise in development : <p> If you happen to come across this blog please be aware that it is under construction . I am currently building a better compatibility between my personal site and- my Flickr account . I 've come across a few wonderful Flash applications that make a seamless connection to Flickr accounts , something I 've been searching for . <p> So , thanks for your interest . Please come back for something better once the foundation is built . <p> What a knucklehead , huh ? In the days following I would write a few little posts on the creative process , started breaking down some of my personal techniques and experimenting with some different art styles . Again , nothing profound . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  care . That 's when everything changed I stopped creating art based on trend or acceptance and started creating art for myself . I started having fun . I started to play . I started to explore . <p> For the first time in my career , Signalnoise.com had become to backbone of my work rather than just a display tool . I wanted to keep it fresh , which meant creating new art and content . They fed each other . A few short months later I was contacted by an up-and-coming design blog to do my first online interview . The email came from a guy named Fabio Sasso and his little Abduzeedo- website would expose my art to the world . <p> Why am I writing this ? Well , I get asked by a lot of students and design professionals about how I " did it " . And the truth is there 's no secret ingredient . I made a decision and stuck with it , started small with that goofy little post above and have been building Signalnoise pixel by pixel ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing it 5 years later but I probably would n't have cared either . I was having fun , and that 's what counts . <p> So today I 'll be reflecting on the last 5 years and the ongoing journey with this little website . It just might get a little weepy.

I was 7 years old when Powerslave was released , so I was too wrapped up in toys and cartoons to notice when metal was the top selling genre on the planet . <p> Other then killer riffs , over the top solos and operatic vocals , Iron Maiden has another strength on their side which was the artwork of Derek Riggs .

The film was in such stark contrast to the efforts of Disney Feature Animation and other animated films previously released by Hollywood up until the time .

Those illustrations for " Yellow Submarine " were done by Peter Max under the superb art direction of Edelmann .

I 'm not talking about making buttloads of money or landing some big agency gigs , but moreso personal development and building a more solid brand foundation . Its normal for me to feel like I 'm floundering around trying to find direction , but looking back at this year I can see a more focused vision despite starting off on the wrong foot . <p> So here we go a look at 2013 and some of the highlights the year brought . <p> February 2013 : - Vintage console illustrations After a year of trying to design movie posters , I decided to give up on the dream out of sheer frustration . This time of weird upheaval led to me creating a bunch of original illustrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much new to me . I figured out a process and started machine-gunning out illustrations in an attempt to re-invent Signalnoise which ended up dictating the rest of my year and caught the attention of new clients . A weird time with a wonderful outcome . <p> February 2013 : - The Rocketeer comic book covers Spearheaded by the greatest comic shop on earth , Strange Adventures , we inked a deal with IDW Publishing where I created 4 original comic book covers for The Rocketeer : Hollywood Horror . Truly a dream job , IDW even catered to my silly whims and printed the illustrations with spot gold foil on the helmets . Had loads of fun doing these . <p> April 2013 : - Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon The best client project I ever worked on . Dean Evans , my 80s brother , brought me onto the project and together we developed the logo and " box art " that would represent Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon online . A teaser was launched on April Fools Day which caused quite the " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Signalnoise was swept up in the excitement as my art flew all over the world . Way too much fun on this one . <p> May 2013 : - Hangin with Kurt Russell During my trip to Los Angeles to speak at Adobe MAX , my good buddy Russell Brown arranged an awesome little dinner party with his photographer friend Greg Gorman . One of the guests was none other than Kurt Russell . I got to hang out with , talk some movies and things with him and give him my poster of THE THING . Heck of a nice guy too . Certainly a high point of 2013 . <p> May 2013 : - The Great Discontent interview I was honoured when my favourite design interview site got a hold of me , The Great Discontent . I ( virtually ) sat down with Ryan and Tina where we got to the bottom of many topics revolving around our industry . Since I wanted to give them some nice professional photos , my friend and wicked talented photographer Krista Comeau came to the rescue . She handsomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control cosmic poster A lovely opportunity spear-headed by Mystery Box was to create a unique Signalnoise poster design for Opening Doors . I decided to reach back to a style I was doing 5 years ago and design something retro-cosmic . Everyone was onboard , and the result is something I 'm very proud of . They even got me to design the Creative Control logo . <p> July 2013 : - Patch designs for Opera Browser I had the wonderful opportunity to work with the great people at Opera Browser in support of their Made to Discover campaign . Opera needed some patch designs to sprinkle throughout their push , heavy embroidery influence and taking cues from Scout badges I had as a kid . So much fun on this one , and a wonderful end product by Opera . <p> July 2013 : - UziCopter : The Signalnoise Tumblr I decided to create a Signalnoise moodboard for my own use , to gather rad inspiration and stuff as reference for future projects . Upon research , the best platform to do that is Tumblr so I set up UziCopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , was featured on several high profile blogs and is currently supporting a following of 2196 . An unexpected surprise , and a very useful resource for all things awesome . <p> July 2013 : - WarGames poster for Skuzzles A big highlight of 2013 was working with Skuzzles on an official movie poster for WarGames . This was a big deal since I had basically given up on doing movie posters after a year-long attempt to break into the poster community proved unsuccessful in 2012 . I had a wonderful time building this poster for my pals at Skuzzles . <p> July 2013 : - Mission patch logos for NFB Space School Its no secret that I enjoy all things to do with space exploration , so I was thrilled when I got a call from the National Film Board of Canada to design mission patch style logos for their launch of the NFB Space School . I designed the official logo for the project as well as all the patches representing the sections . Honoured to have been a part of a project that teaches kids about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superman poster After getting asked to contribute to the SUPER Art Show in Australia , I was lucky enough to lay claim on the Man of Steel the most iconic superhero of our time . Exploring a more geometric , painterly style I developed a poster capturing the happy Superman from my childhood . <p> July 2013 : - Heavy Metal Photoshop t-shirt When Adobe asked me to design a cool Photoshop shirt for them to give away at the San Diego Comic Convention , I immediately blurted out " I 'm gon na make you a heavy metal shirt ! " . To my surprise they were onboard , and I developed them this hilarious design . Badass . I even put all the Photoshop version release dates on the back of the shirt just like tour dates . So much fun . <p> August 2013:The StarKade Series - While building the deck on the back of my house during the summer I decided I wanted to design some fun little illustrations depicting WWE wrestlers from my youth . What started as a little project quickly blossomed into an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 2013 , all of which have sold out . 2014 is looking very bright for the StarKade series as I 'm being approached by galleries and art shows . Stay Tuned ! <p> September 2013 Panthers and Designers : Its not too often you get to hang out with the likes of these guys . That bearded man-mountain is Carolina Panther Ryan Kalil , and that baseball-capped fella is designer extraordinaire Matt Stevens . I was in town speaking at Blend Conference and Ryan was nice enough to sit down with Matt and I to jaw about some football , design , film and other fun projects . We had a killer time , so much so that Ryan turned me into a Panthers fan for life . Got ta support your buddies ! <p> November 2013 : - Creative Spark , Lynda documentary I 'm still stunned that this happened . The mighty Lynda sent a film crew up to Dartmouth to shoot a documentary on me and my art right here in my studio . The largest source of online design education launched the doc and it was quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honoured but yeah , still in shock . <p> November 2013 : - Adobe InDesign interview Another honour of 2013 was being interviewed and featured in Adobe Inspire magazine . We got to the bottom of a lot of issues , and they designed the iPad version of the issue complete with an animated panther illustration I created for them . Whoa . Being interviewed by the very people who create the software I use every day blew my mind . Thank-you Adobe ! <p> All year : - Signalnoise 2013 World Tour- One of the biggest highlights for Signalnoise this year was the amount of traveling I did . There were 20 live dates booked across Canada , the United States , Europe and even the Philippines . Think I spent more time in hotel rooms than I did at home . Once again , a giant thanks to everyone who invited me to their events , everyone who came out to see me speak , and a shout to all those fellow presenters I had the pleasure of meeting in 2013 . <p> All the best in 2014 , everyone ! <h> About 226303 @qwx1086303

The topmost poster is a show-stopper , I need to track down a large version of that for the wall .

He taught Animation Design and Illustration at various art schools in Germany and Holland . To me , hell always be known for creating those hallucinogenic landscapes of Pepperland from that classic 1968 Yellow Submarine film . <p> I loved that movie a lot when I was young , it was so different from any other animated cartoon . The film was in such stark contrast to the efforts of Disney Feature Animation and other animated films previously released by Hollywood up until the time . It was limited animation but Edelmanns art direction made it so uniquely different from anything else . It also seemed to pave the way for Terry Gilliams animations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently The Beatles were so impressed after seeing a draft of the film in 68 , that they agreed to make a live-action cameo appearance in the final scene , which was filmed in early February 1968 upon the bands return from India . The cameo was originally intended to feature a post-production psychedelic background and effects ; but due to time and budget constraints , a blank , black background remained in the final film . <p> Although he was born in Czechoslovakia and his mother was Czech , Heinz Edelmann was a German designer , living and working in Germany , with a prodigious output . Those illustrations for " Yellow Submarine " were done by Peter Max under the superb art direction of Edelmann . Edelmann designed and illustrated many posters , books , ads , and more , describing himself as a " layout man who could draw .

@@121792394 @10792394/ <h> Inspiration : Iron Maiden , Pt. 1 <p> This inspirational post might be subjective considering musical taste , but being a metalhead here is a part of music history and identity design that simply can not be ignored , the mighty Iron Maiden . <p> Maiden is a band that I only discovered for myself within recent years , but their part in metal history has been substantial and undeniable . In 1983 , after releasing their self-titled album , Killers and Number of the Beast , Iron Maiden claimed the global metal thrown after going platinum in the US with the release of Piece of Mind . Only to follow with the epic Powerslave . I was 7 years old when Powerslave was released , so I was too wrapped up in toys and cartoons to notice when metal was the top selling genre on the planet . <p> Other then killer riffs , over the top solos and operatic vocals , Iron Maiden has another strength on their side which was the artwork of Derek Riggs . Riggs supplied Maiden with album artwork throughout the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie . Riggs instantly recognizable artwork played a big part in placing Maiden at the top of the metal heap , and spawned a number of other bands attempting to create their own style and mascot based on Maidens idea . <p> HA !

Being a fan of that Draplin for quite some time ( 3 shirts to prove it ) , I really enjoy seeing different cities bringing him in to speak to younger and veteran designers alike . He s got things to say . Important things . Honest things . <p> So this little note is to bring your attention to the event and direct you to where you can help the guys make this happen . If you 're in Philly mark your calendar. - Get over to the Kickstarter page and show your support .

Being a hockey fan back in the 80s and 90s those Jets were part of our team , and by " our team " I mean being on this side of the border . Were a patriotic bunch up here and tend to cheer for our Canadian teams . So it was a sad day to hear that Winnipegs team was being packed up and shipped down to- Phoenix . Sad day indeed . <p> Well here we are . The Jets are back and us Canadians are pretty happy about it . I was cheering for you Peggers the whole time , hoping luck would swing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what its worth , I loved their old logo for too many reasons to list . BOTH of them actually . Simple , obvious and whatever else . Nice colors , somehow very Winnipeg and it fit in nicely with the other Canadian teams at the time . <p> With the team returning to Winnipeg it was inevitable that they go through the process of a re-brand . I would have been- ecstatic- to see that old logo return as their official , but this is 2011 . Fat chance with all the re-brands that sports teams go through these days in the first place . Last Friday , Buffalo correspondent Paul Pants gave the word that theyd be releasing the new identity " in an hour " so I was pretty excited to see what they came up with . I was also a bit frightened <p> I 'll go on record here . Just personal taste so do n't  chew my head off . I have a pretty strong dislike for modern sports logos . It started back in the 90s when teams started going through all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple and iconic to these over-beveled , character-based , swooshing , snarling hunks of shit . They became- interchangeable- pretty quickly , and it was n't only with one sport . Baseball , basketball , football , hockey they all started to look the same . No respect for individual identities or team legacy . I- completely- understand that design and printing technologies are far better than they were before , allowing us to do much more with jerseys and stuff , but just because we can does n't  mean we should . Logos transformed into illustrations . <p> This is why I was frightened while waiting for the new Jets logo unveiling . " What if its some jet zooming forward , shooting fire , with a big angry mouth on the front ? " Seriously , could have happened . I was pretty nervous . So when I 'm in a situation like that I always ask myself " What would I do if given the opportunity ? " . I fired up Illustrator and threw together a Jets logo that I 'd like to see on a jersey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocked onto a player . <p> I 'm still tampering with the logo even as I write this post . I did it for fun . I did a Jets logo the way I 'd like to see it done in an attempt to play off the previous identity , something you Winnipeg inhabitants might recognize and enjoy . Not much more to the story , really . <p> Just a little note in conclusion for what they did release as the new Jets identity . My first reaction was genuine relief . They did n't  go the direction of " crappy , hip , typical sports logo " and for that I send every thumbs-up I can to the team involved in creating it . Huge relief . It was obviously created with respect to the team and Canadian air force history . <p> Its catching some beef online and I 'm not sure it deserves it . Yes it looks a bit military , and I 'm curious to see the logo from afar ( like on a players jersey during a game ) to see if the design holds up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a silver shark or whatever that " thrasher " was supposed to be . Its simplified , plays off the Royal Canadian Air Force roundel , and has the leaf worked in . Not so bad . <p> As for my little logo , might get some stickers of this guy printed up . This ones for you , Winnipeg . <p> All you Canadian kids out there probably recognize these little morsels , and so will Mom and Dad .

Well , it worked and today I can swim like doofus whenever I need to . <p> The Canadian Red Cross swimming lessons were broken up into " colors " .

On the list of " cool stuff I hope to do during my career as a designer " , this project lands right at the top , filed under " 1 . Design a shirt for my favorite metal band " . Enter the heavy as hell , talented Texans known as The Sword . <p> Back in 2006 or something I came across a link to their Myspace and immediately thought " The Sword , that 's a cool name for a band " and decided to give them a listen . I fired up Iron Swan for the first time , which is a funny introduction to the bands sound- considering- the fairly long subdued intro . I was sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the heavy and almost took my head clean off . Fan for life , right there . No foolin . Been listening to the boys- consistently- ever since , throughout their albums- Age of Winters , Gods of the Earth and their most recent space epic Warp Riders . <p> " Man , I 'd love to work with those guys someday . " said James , years ago . <p> Last February I sit down at my computer and a tweet from the band pops up " Hey , were looking for an artist " , or something like that . 20 seconds later I had my website link over to them . 2 minutes later I shot over an email . Suddenly I 'm emailing back and forth with the guys in my favorite metal troop , developed a poster that was used on 2 of their tours ( Australia and Europe ) , and now a brand new t-shirt the boys will be having- on-hand- as they tour with Kyuss Lives this fall . So damn proud . <p> Shown above is what I created for the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild on this thing and offered some helpful tips along the way . You can definitely hear a vast metal influence in their sound so I wanted this design to be thrown back to the roots of metal way back , talkin Black Sabbath days with a twist of The Sword in there . I used their older logo because it just reeks of old school metal . Love that thing . Shown here are 4 different colorways . <p> Here we go , further implementation of my new Signalnoise identity , in sticky form . I came home from the office the other day to find a nice envelope from my friends at Sticker Mule with a fresh bunch of my new Signalnoise logo stickers . Nothing makes me happier then seeing my identity on stuff , especially stuff I can hand out to friends . <p> If you 've met me at any of the design events I make it a priority to get my stickers into peoples hands , and I 've been real proud of my previous stickers . Simple , round . Those things served me well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now obsolete . Out of print forever . Collectors items . EBay gold . <p> Enter the new hexagon sticker , which may or may not have been completely ripped from my favorite board game , Settlers of Catan . Draw your own conclusions . <p> Now , the kind folks over at Sticker Mule hooked me up with a nice sampling of their capabilities at the right time , since I needed to update my swag . But here 's the thing , these stickers look and feel different then other stickers . There 's a soft , matte finish almost feels plastic . No gloss . The best comparison I can hand out is a vinyl toy texture . Seamless color , looks real , real nice . Big thanks to Sticker Mule for really knocking these out of the park . <p> So if you see me at any upcoming design events , I 'll have some of these on me to throw around .

These were all plucked from Project Thirty-Three , which was a task in itself since their supply of amazing images goes on and on . Huge source of great stuff . <p> Amazing what was created in order to give these records their visual identity . Some are symbolic of sound/instruments , some are straight up illustration , and others are design experiments of Swiss flavor . Most of which have a limited color palette with amazing results . <p> here 's a poster design that has been floating around my head and sketchbooks for about a year , so I decided to get it out and make it real . It was about time to realize this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reference of this design is obviously Olympic posters created back in the 1970s , mainly the 1972 Munich Olympic Games .

A challenge to say the least , since I 'm used to running hog wild through Photoshop and flinging lights all over the place . <p> This was a calmer process , I really enjoyed it . I 'm going to print this up in the next few days after a bit of mild adjustments . <p> Here are some vintage matchbook covers grabbed from this mighty Flickr set . I love everything about these . Solid design made through obvious limitations in printing quality . These guys did what they had to in order to make their brands stand out in the world of matches . I especially love the texture on these blown-up scans and slight blurriness and overlap of the ink . The real deal . <p> At least , I think these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking about soup .

Spectrums , lens flares , space stuff , all the things I remember seeing on tv when I was a kid . I wanted it a bit rough and textured as well . Complete with slight film skips and dust . Authentic , ya know ? <p> Most of these went unused and the final product was predominately my spectrum lines all animated up . Really cool stuff , and put together by the talented folks at Laundry .

@@121792404 @10792404/ <h> Support for Shepard <p> The topic of Shepard Fairey has been a hot and cold subject with artists and designers over the past few years , and the arguement has recently been thrust into the spotlight with the lawsuit over his photo referencing for the now famous- Obama poster . There are those who disagree with Fairey and his work calling him a plagiarist ( see Obey Plagiarist Shepard Fairey ) , while others are coming to his defence as an artist ( see The Medium is the Message ) . <p> Given the nature of Faireys art and his methods of appropriating found imagery , the argument is quite understandable and I 've read countless valid points on both ends of the spectrum . Obey Giant blurs a lot of lines . I have been following Faireys work since 1998 , discovering his website shortly before I graduated from college and entered my career as a designer . I watched him grow from an obscure street artist with a modest selection of posters for sale- to the almost household name he is today . His work and ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm sure many others . <p> The reasons for my supporting Shepard Fairey are mostly personal as I believe in him and the work he is doing . He s not afraid to stand up for what he believes in , which is obvious given the political and social subject matter he deals with in his art . In his book Supply and Demand he cites many of his inspirations , sources and reference material outlining how he goes about making his art and the ideas they hold . <p> Creating the poster above is my own small way of showing support to one of my favorite artists , and I completely understand and respect that some do not agree . This is a touchy subject , so please feel welcome to voice your thoughts on the matter . A healthy dialogue on such topics are always good . <p> As far as this poster goes , I will be printing a very small run of 40 to be given away to those interested in showing their support for Shepard . I will write a post soon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record , I used the press photo of Fairey from this article to construct my design : ) <p> I 'm not sure how to feel about SF after I first read the plagiarist article last year . What angered me at first was his anti-captalism ideas , but he admitted that he was a capitalist . I think you are a true artist and designer James . As for Shepard ? I am starting to see him as nothing more than a real good production artist . Just my opinion . I do appreciate this post though and your poster is pretty freckin cool ! <p> Great concept and even better execution with this poster I cant wait to find out how to win one ! <p> On the issue at hand , Fairey walks a thin line legally ( obviously given the legal uproar over this ) by using " found " items that may or may not have existing copyrights . I think the point of his work though is to blur the lines between commercial and fine art in order to espouse a given message . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , but for now great cause and great design ! <p> Zachary makes good points . This whole thing would n't be such a big deal if the Hope poster werent successful . If one of my photos were used by Fairey , I 'd take it as a complement ( unless , of course , it were used for something I do n't  agree with ) . On the other hand , if I made a vector illustration of a photo , and Fairey just went ahead and used that , I 'd think a lot differently . But that 's not what happened . Fairey never tried to say that his works were created without using reference material . <p> The fact is , if you look at the AP photo and the Hope poster as art pieces , there 's a huge difference . Each , while sharing the same subject matter , has their own concept and idea , youd see how vastly different they are . Youd see that youd paste one to the wall , and juxtapose another with a newspaper article . Obviously , you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article ( thus , the gray area Zachary mentioned ) , but to ignore the conceptually differences between the two is being just plain stubborn . <p> On a less valid point , Fairey is a graffiti artist . This is what he does.The very fact that this is an issue is proof enough that he is successful . Writing your name on a train has come a long way in terms of notoriety . <p> I really like the poster too , but honestly , I think I 'd be kind of creeped out with having Shepard Fairey on my wall . Especially if it were hanging next to my Hope poster . <p> ps keep up the good work , James have been following your work for a while . <p> Great way to show your support man . Respect . My two cents : I think this poster could be a little bit more " signalnoiz-ed " : P great mix of styles already but I think lacks a LITTLE bit of well .. James White to fully nail it both visually and conceptually . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response . If you 're talking about Shepard the graffiti/street artist , his career as such is a study in the practice of straddling the law and perceived propriety in order to convey a particular message . 14 arrests ( or whatever the current number is ) and now this lawsuit make it pretty clear that a kind of lawful ambiguity might be a huge part of the engine that makes his work go . <p> I myself enjoy Shepard Faireys work , although it is hard to agree with his ethics all of the time . <p> He freely admits that he " appropriates " cultural images from other artists , puts his spin on them and releases them as part of his own artwork . For every amazing poster , like the HOPE poster or the Duality of Humanity series , there are several less technically and visually appealing releases that make you wonder what Faireys grades at RISD were . I think his reasons for using appropriated images puts him just barely on the side of " acceptable " in terms of art , but unfortunately the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less open minded terms . <p> As far as the AP Image case goes , I think Fairey was fully in his right to use that photo as a reference when creating his poster . First , he is not trying to sell a copyrighted image . He did not claim the photo as his own work and he is not trying to sell the photo . Second the HOPE poster is very different from the photo it references . The composition , colors , medium and feeling of the two are very different . Unless the courts decide the AP can copyright Obamas face , hopefully this case will be dismissed without any damaging ( for other artists/designers ) ammendments to US Copyright law . <p> As far as I am concerned , if you consider yourself an artist and a member of the artistic community , no matter what medium you use , you should support art when it comes under attack like this . We should all be banding together to defend our freedom to expression . <p> Great to see so many constructive ideas and thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepard is quite important , and whatever outcome transpires will no doubt have effects on the art world , either creatively or legally . Thanks for contributing to the dialogue . <p> Devin , Nick hit the nail on the head . To create the image in Illustrator , I first treat the photo in Photoshop to make it super high contrast . Then I map out the shapes in Illustrator by hand using the photo as reference . It takes some time , but it beats the roughness generally created by automatic trace tools . <p> Some of his images are borderline , some of them are pure and simple plagiarism and others are not . Some of his images are inspired by others . Some are just a bad case of " copy and paste " and " Let 's just change the colors . " <p> Like the image he stole from the " Big Brother is Watching You " poster . He stole the face plain and simple and any reasonable person could conclude that Shepard stole the image and is in violation of copyright laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure he adjusted the contrast a little and added a distressed look to it . But if that 's all I have to do to steal somebodys artwork and make a profit off of it , true artist lose and the " Big Brother " reproduction industry , that Shepard seems to hate so much , wins . <p> He should be held liable for his actions . If not , people will just start stealing artwork from whoever they want and claiming it as their own . <p> I Do n't  disagree with remixing samples from other artists , that is the foundation not only of graphical art but of film and even plain spoken language , but to then stamp copywrite all over it is a unbelievable case of hypocracy. if you take something from a commons , you have to give something back otherwise everyone else in that community that relies on the pool of samples suffers . this guy is no different than the Russian that copyrighted the : ) <p> Pienose and Florenz , I used a combination of Bookman Regular and Bookman Swash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase is too much , so I mix it up to keep the big swoops to a minimum : ) <p> Mike , this is the first time I 've heard about the Steelers incident , thanks for giving me the heads up .

Can you clarify why you think its ironic ? <p> Apologies if I sounded glib I enjoy your work and would n't have seen this conversation if I did n't  already subscribe to your RSS . <p> My comment was aimed more at the discussion around Fairey , fair use , and attribution to " found " images . Only Fairey knows what his true intentions were with disseminating the image , but I do know that in all its incarnations I 've never seen it with an Obey logo at the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , as do , I think , yours , since I can spot a " signalnoise " image used around the web pretty quickly . I think that if I had the chops and mettle to produce such public work and let it into the wild that my support for Fairey would observe the same detachment from origin and explicit authorship that his used in this case . <p> Where " ownership " takes hold ( or when an " owner " opts to take hold of it ) when you 're talking about interpretation influencing further interpretation is something that designers and artists have been grappling with for a while and its not gon na get any easier ! I think I just had a sudden feeling of irony when I saw the pairing of " Support " with authorship and at the same time a message ( with regards to Fairey ) of non-authorship.

For those of you who were into comics back in the 90s , specifically Image Comics , you might recognize PROPHET . Being dumb teenagers , me and my pal Mike were all over Image back in the day , constantly drawing our favorite characters . Looking at this , you can probably tell what comic pencillers I was a fan of at the time . <p> But this drawing of PROPHET represents something special to me . Real sentimental . I drew this in 1995 on the very first day of Graphic Design . After going through the signing of forms , course outlines and whatever else , the teacher gave us all some paper and asked us to draw something so she could get a gage on where people were coming from creatively . I remember people drawing houses and portraits I drew PROPHET . I was out of high school for only 2 months at this point and this- was the first drawing I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 18 , just a kid . <p> Drawing was something I just loved to do , at home in my room . But this time it was different . I was in a place to learn to create . To take those years and years of drawing and- wield- it in a different way with access to new tools and materials . I was at the beginning of a long journey and my future was unknown . Still is , I guess . <p> So when I was asked to draw something that September afternoon in 1995 , I fearlessly drew PROPHET in a room full of strangers . No embarrassment at all . Still proud of that .

I 'm cautious about spreading myself too thin , having stagnant accounts all over the place , and just a general need to have my work centralized . Its all about housekeeping around here , I like simplicity . <p> However , when Google recently launched its Google+ platform , I decided to give this new thing a shot . I was generously hooked up with an invitation by my pal Fabio Sasso and was off to the races . Before plugging it on the blog I wanted to take a week and experiment with it . Launch a few previews , set up my contacts , just to see how the vibe was on this new sharing platform . Have to say , I 'm rather pleased .

I 'm proud to be able to show the creative I put together for my friends over at FITC for the Toronto 2012 event happening this coming April . I worked with Shawn Pucknell , the director of FITC on this one , where his biggest feedback was always " Make it epic ! " Great guy . So out came the lasers . <p> The team just launched FITC Toronto 2012 over on their website , and I 'm proud to be speaking for a 3rd year in a row . Go check out the amazing roster . Be there , Toronto ! <p> Maybe this sounds like a silly question but i was wondering . Can a poster print successfully that is so rich in detail , textures , effects etc ? Would it head to an offset printing house or just simple digital printers ? Do you use specific pantone colours and colour values to be sure about that ? Everything looks fine for the web and motion graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brochure that used a black to grey gradient as a background <p> Also @Emmanuel James has his stuff digitally printed on RGB printers , or at least he used to have ( no sure how Merchline does it ) .

@@121792504 @10792504/ <p> So after a lot of pondering and a lot of advice from friends , I will be working on phasing out my current Signalnoise logo to replace it with this new colorful identity . <p> The new identity was greatly influenced by colorful television broadcast graphics from the 1970s ( namely NBCs peacock ) . I wanted something simple that might lend itself to some nice animated sequences yet hold its own on the corner of my poster designs . I do have a soft spot for my winged skull , but I felt the time was right to evolve my personal identity to something a bit more appropriate . <p> Here is another sketch image using the Forge engine . This is a very organic process when I start building the image using the shape combinations the engine generates , so I really do n't  know how the image will transpire until its close to completion . <p> I 'm a very meticulous artist , so the main reason I built Forge was to have a loss of control over where elements land . <p> A logo should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet be unique enough to distinguish itself and convey its message . That being said , the hardest task I have ever taken on as a designer was developing my own logo for Signalnoise . I would like a design one day , then dislike it the next . <p> So here is a look back at my different Signalnoise logos , the first of which was designed in 1999 when I was 22 years old . As I learned different tools and techniques , while being influenced by the new and exciting art I was being exposed to , the style of my logo was swinging wildly all over the place . <p> It was obvious that I was unwilling to let the skull design drop , so seen here is the symbol in a number of incarnations until I eventually landed on the winged skull that I have been using for the past few years . <p> A number of these logos can be seen in use throughout my various website designs found in the Signalnoise Graveyard . <p> I started playing with my Forge engine again recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago . I had mentioned it before , but Forge is a simple Flash application I developed about 3 years ago to help me generate random assortments of shapes and patterns . As simple and clunky as the program is , Forge has helped me create quite a lot of useful vector assets I use in a lot of my art . <p> I want to start using more of its organic tendancies in my work , and give the program a bit more freedom to do what it wants . The piece above is just a sketch of its capabilities , with effects and colors added in Photoshop . <p> I am having some technical troubles with my home computer at the moment , which unfortunately limits me to using my Wii for internet access . This being the case , I 've been watching a lot of videos on Youtube to keep me inspired and I felt compelled to post three of my favorites . These three videos showcase some of my favorite artists talking about their craft , showing examples of their work , and note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a reality . <p> J.J. Abrams is the creator of Alias , Lost and producer of Cloverfield . Not only do I enjoy J.J.s unique methods of telling stories , but I enjoy seeing him passionately talk about his inspirations and why he does what he does . The Mystery Box is a talk he did at Ted in March of 2007 . <p> Joshua Davis has been an inspiration for a decade . I 've talked about his work before , and he is seen here doing a presentation for QBN Sessions in September 2007 . Josh talks about some of his inspirations , his work methods , and a wonderful piece about working your ass off to achieve your goals . I had the pleasure to see him speak at the FlashForward conference in New York way back in 2000 , and aside from being very inspired I remember thinking " Man , this dude is hilarious . " <p> Shepard Fairey is the mighty Obey Giant . What I like most about Fairey other then his work is his story about how he discovered , or stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a wonderful and striking brand with the Andre image , but he was sharp enough to realize the phenomenon it had become , and ultimately use that to inject more power into his concept through recognition . He is proof that you need to keep creating what you love to create . Fairey was also a part of the QBN Sessions in September 2007 . <p> I decided to enter the MTV Engine Room competition after reading about it over at Abduzeedo about a month ago . I 'm not usually one to enter online competitions , but this one caught my attention after I read the part about submitting a video to introduce yourself . I have no video or editing experience , I 've never written anything to be shot , nor do I even own a camera capable of shooting video . I was up for the challenge and I have always wanted to experiment with motion , so off I went to piece something together . <p> My friends are the most supportive/hilarious people I know and I leap at any opportunity to work with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to Chris Toms for co-starring and lending his camera to shoot everything , Ian " Jerko " Cann for rocking out , Ben Jeddrie for lending me his hotdog man , Joel Leli+vre and Jonny Mitchell for helping me out with the editing and technical side of things . <p> Now the crazy part <p> Last Saturday I was about 30 minutes away from completing the editing and sending the video off to MTV when the unthinkable happened : a virus seemed to appear out of thin air and crippled my poor home computer .

But since the show was on TV in the late 70s I was too young to even know anything about pop culture . I had no idea who Buck was when I was a kid other then what dad told me about the show . But here is where blind kid-like enthusiasm comes in . The lunchbox had a dude aiming a laser gun , hot girl , a robot , a spaceship and a real cool logo everything a kid needs . Seeing the show was irrelevant , I still knew I had the coolest lunch in the class . <p> The round , cut-out portrait of Buck still makes me laugh .

The image above is the tin version but what I had was plastic . Looked exactly the same , handle and everything . Those tin ones get smashed to crap but my plastic box lasted for years .

Man , that definitely would have made you the coolest kid at lunch hour . <p> I had a similar box , with motive from E.T .

@@121792508 @10792508/ <h> Hobo With a Shotgun : Poster process <p> If you 've seen my Back to the Future presentation at any point this year you would have seen me tell the story of Hobo With a Shotgun and my involvement with the design of some of the elements . I 've posted about the film before and talked about it on my broadcasts several times , but up until now the full behind-the-scenes gear was only shown onstage . Its about time I retire that section of the presentation to launch it online for everyone to see . <p> Its my favorite story to tell , my favorite project in recent years , and best of all it was all done for friends in order to help them with their project . That 's what its all about . We support each other around these parts and Dartmouth blood is thick , especially when being splattered onscreen . I was thrilled when Jason Eisener and Rob Cotterill asked me to design a Hobo poster . While not being the official one used , it was a wildly entertaining challenge . So let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobo poster thumbnails . Working out a concept . <p> Full Rutger Hauer drawing , blue lead and ink . <p> Digital concept mock-up #1 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #2 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #3 . Boom ! <p> I knew early on that I was going to digitally paint the poster , something I 've been wanting to attempt for a while . A huge challenge , totally out of my comfort zone . Ive been a big fan of guys like Drew Struzan and Bob Peak for a long time , so doing something like that offered up some unique- obstacles- which- challenged- my entire proces . Before I got to building the actual poster in Photoshop , I needed to have things planned out properly and extensively . <p> Shown above are my original concept sketches and digital mock-ups . I even went as far as doing a meticulous drawing of Rutger Hauer to get myself in the groove of capturing likeness in Photoshop . Again , something I 'm pretty unfamiliar with . The digital mock-ups were unsuccessful from a design standpoint , but man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person looking at the poster . So funny . <p> Palette samples . <p> The great thing about working with the guys is they have a really specific style in mind , and they can express it in art samples . Crazy helpful . Shown above are some color examples Jason sent over that he used as inspiration for the lighting and palette of Hobo . Bright pinks and purples are top priority , which I did n't  know since I had n't  seen the film at this point . This really put me on the right path . Here are some digital mock-ups I put together with the new colours in mind . <p> Digital concept mock-up #4 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #5 . <p> I started some new mock-ups with the proper palette and vibe and things started to click . Again drawing on inspiration from Struzan , I collaged together some of the photos Jason sent over to get the composition nailed down . I can see a big Star Wars influence in there , which was fine since me and the Hobo guys are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You might be able to see a Bill Sienkiewicz vibe in there too , I was looking at old Dazzler comic covers at the time . <p> Vector colour palette test . <p> Once the composition was coming along , I decided to do a vector colour study before moving onto the digital paints . Having the photos were great , but I wanted to dilute the composition to know exactly what my palette was going to be . So I got rid of the details and roughed up the above image using simple shapes to represent the areas . <p> I should also mention that you 're going to see changes in layout and characters as we go . The poster was a total work in progress in terms of what characters would go where , even during the final stages . <p> Starting in with the digital paints , blocking stuff in . <p> Close-up of paint progress . More texture and detailing . <p> After all that planning I was finally able to leap into Photoshop and start building the paints . I took a semester of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even though I did n't  enjoy it that much I took from it some important techniques which lent itself quite well to Photoshop . I learned to block things in and layer colours on top of one another to build palettes and texture . Very helpful at this stage . <p> Shown above are my initial steps . Really rough and simple at t is point as I mapped things out . A big challenge was to let the brush in Photoshop act like paint . It was oksy to get a bit messy with it and let strokes fall outside the lines . It suited the content , yknow ? <p> Digital paint mid-point . <p> After many , many hours of digital painting the palette was starting to get away from me , as shown above . It did n't  have the life those initial compositions had and the colours were not near what I wanted . I did the " morning after " test , you know , when you sleep on it then wake up and hate what you 've done ? Yeah that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers one by one and started adjusting everything . Added some new effects and dry brush textures to this thing . <p> By the end of the day , this is where I was : <p> Palette and atmosphere revision . <p> Now were talking . This was where I wanted to be . I dug it , the guys dug it . We were off to the races . <p> Final Hobo With a Shotgun poster . <p> So after a great many hours painting textures , splatters , characters , lighting and effects the final poster emerged . The scene changed as I went , but it captured that initial flavour we all really wanted . Something fun , and cool , which would be very happy on the cover of a sun-bleached VHS box . <p> In the end , even though this wasnt used as the official Hobo poster or box art , I would n't trade this project for the world . It was created for a killer movie , a killer Dartmouth movie , for my friends . And it offered up some real challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I learned a huge amount by working on this thing , about the medium and about myself as a creator . To date Ive only printed 2 of these things at full movie poster size , but more are in the pipeline for sure . Youve been warned . There you have it . <h> 7 Comments <p> again an amazing design with a really nice oldschool feeling The only detail that bother me is the fact that the two lines on the right of the word " shotgun " looks like they are not finished I mean , since the poster is very dark we cant really tell it comes from the drop shadow <p> Sweet , this couldnt have come along at a better time , I have to re-imaging a movie poster for design class and I chose Tron Legacy , cause its an amazing movie and the Hobo with a Shotgun poster is kinda what I was thinking of doing .

Would it head to an offset printing house or just simple digital printers ? Do you use specific pantone colours and colour values to be sure about that ? Everything looks fine for the web and motion graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brochure that used a black to grey gradient as a background <p> Also @Emmanuel James has his stuff digitally printed on RGB printers , or at least he used to have ( no sure how Merchline does it ) . Its a great way to have your prints look exactly the way you see them on the screen .

@@121792524 @10792524/ <h> Contemporary Japanese Posters : Mitsuo Katsui <p> A number of years ago a friend gave me a thin booklet entitled Contemporary Japanese Posters 1992 , with the thought that I might like what I saw inside . I took a flip through after it was handed to me and he was right , I was quite intrigued by the poster designs it contained but had shortly afterward misplaced the book on my bookshelf and it was lost in the sea of magazines and hardcovers I owned . <p> By chance years later , I rediscovered the book while cleaning up my book collection and was floored by what it contained , in both imagery and literature . Outlined is 15 prominent Japanese poster designers from the 70s , 80s and 90s , and the book was , I believe , a companion piece to the exhibition held featuring these artists and designs . One of the artists within is Mitsuo Katsui . I apologize for the quality of the posters above as I had a hard time finding references to his posters online . <p> Instead of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the very interesting piece he wrote for the publication ( I assume ) in 1992 at the time of the exhibition : <p> " In no other time were such questions raised as often as today : What is the relevance of communication in graphic design , and more importantly , what aspects of humanity and social missions can graphic design fulfill ? I understand that too well graphic designs do not normally make direct statements with regard to the issues of society , such as global environmental issues . But I think graphic designers interested in communication must be brave enough to suggest in their designs , ways of thinking about various issues by giving favorable influences on peoples minds . I have to keep reminding myself what it means to be a creator , and that I should continue challenging my goals with an open mind . <p> The 20th century was witnessed a considerable progress in technology . Now that a new reality our heritage of the era of " visual images " is in our hands , what will this rapid transformation of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visual designs will eventually take over the functions of multimedia in communication design . <p> I very strongly feel that I carry a heavy responsibility as a creator who witnessed the shift from a low-tech to a high-tech environment .

Something to think about . <h> 4 Comments <p> Some people are just visionaries , I feel that since design is almost a backend service . We tend to belittle our roles and functions and forget that we play an essential role as communicative creators despite how much technology has simplified or cheapened the process . 
@@121792526 @10792526/ <p> If you 've seen my Back to the Future presentation at any point this year you would have seen me tell the story of Hobo With a Shotgun and my involvement with the design of some of the elements . I 've posted about the film before and talked about it on my broadcasts several times , but up until now the full behind-the-scenes gear was only shown onstage . Its about time I retire that section of the presentation to launch it online for everyone to see . <p> Its my favorite story to tell , my favorite project in recent years , and best of all it was all done for friends in order to help them with their project . That 's what its all about . We support each other around these parts and Dartmouth blood is thick , especially when being splattered onscreen . I was thrilled when Jason Eisener and Rob Cotterill asked me to design a Hobo poster . While not being the official one used , it was a wildly entertaining challenge . So let 's load those barrels and get to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Full Rutger Hauer drawing , blue lead and ink . <p> Digital concept mock-up #1 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #2 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #3 . Boom ! <p> I knew early on that I was going to digitally paint the poster , something I 've been wanting to attempt for a while . A huge challenge , totally out of my comfort zone . Ive been a big fan of guys like Drew Struzan and Bob Peak for a long time , so doing something like that offered up some unique- obstacles- which- challenged- my entire proces . Before I got to building the actual poster in Photoshop , I needed to have things planned out properly and extensively . <p> Shown above are my original concept sketches and digital mock-ups . I even went as far as doing a meticulous drawing of Rutger Hauer to get myself in the groove of capturing likeness in Photoshop . Again , something I 'm pretty unfamiliar with . The digital mock-ups were unsuccessful from a design standpoint , but man , I still love that one of the Hobo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . <p> Palette samples . <p> The great thing about working with the guys is they have a really specific style in mind , and they can express it in art samples . Crazy helpful . Shown above are some color examples Jason sent over that he used as inspiration for the lighting and palette of Hobo . Bright pinks and purples are top priority , which I did n't  know since I had n't  seen the film at this point . This really put me on the right path . Here are some digital mock-ups I put together with the new colours in mind . <p> Digital concept mock-up #4 . <p> Digital concept mock-up #5 . <p> I started some new mock-ups with the proper palette and vibe and things started to click . Again drawing on inspiration from Struzan , I collaged together some of the photos Jason sent over to get the composition nailed down . I can see a big Star Wars influence in there , which was fine since me and the Hobo guys are all kids of the 80s . VHS culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Sienkiewicz vibe in there too , I was looking at old Dazzler comic covers at the time . <p> Vector colour palette test . <p> Once the composition was coming along , I decided to do a vector colour study before moving onto the digital paints . Having the photos were great , but I wanted to dilute the composition to know exactly what my palette was going to be . So I got rid of the details and roughed up the above image using simple shapes to represent the areas . <p> I should also mention that you 're going to see changes in layout and characters as we go . The poster was a total work in progress in terms of what characters would go where , even during the final stages . <p> Starting in with the digital paints , blocking stuff in . <p> Close-up of paint progress . More texture and detailing . <p> After all that planning I was finally able to leap into Photoshop and start building the paints . I took a semester of foundation paint at a local art school back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that much I took from it some important techniques which lent itself quite well to Photoshop . I learned to block things in and layer colours on top of one another to build palettes and texture . Very helpful at this stage . <p> Shown above are my initial steps . Really rough and simple at t is point as I mapped things out . A big challenge was to let the brush in Photoshop act like paint . It was oksy to get a bit messy with it and let strokes fall outside the lines . It suited the content , yknow ? <p> Digital paint mid-point . <p> After many , many hours of digital painting the palette was starting to get away from me , as shown above . It did n't  have the life those initial compositions had and the colours were not near what I wanted . I did the " morning after " test , you know , when you sleep on it then wake up and hate what you 've done ? Yeah that . So I took an entire day , ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Added some new effects and dry brush textures to this thing . <p> By the end of the day , this is where I was : <p> Palette and atmosphere revision . <p> Now were talking . This was where I wanted to be . I dug it , the guys dug it . We were off to the races . <p> Final Hobo With a Shotgun poster . <p> So after a great many hours painting textures , splatters , characters , lighting and effects the final poster emerged . The scene changed as I went , but it captured that initial flavour we all really wanted . Something fun , and cool , which would be very happy on the cover of a sun-bleached VHS box . <p> In the end , even though this wasnt used as the official Hobo poster or box art , I would n't trade this project for the world . It was created for a killer movie , a killer Dartmouth movie , for my friends . And it offered up some real challenges which put me in a place I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this thing , about the medium and about myself as a creator . To date Ive only printed 2 of these things at full movie poster size , but more are in the pipeline for sure . Youve been warned . There you have it . <p> Ive been talking about working on this poster for a couple of months now , and I 'm super happy to have been given the green light by the hobo boys to launch it . Here is the Signalnoise poster design for the upcoming film Hobo With a Shotgun . Ive been waiting close to 3 years to work on this thing , so I was thrilled when Jason and Rob asked me to get rockin on it . I have known Jason and Rob for a few years now , meeting them through the comic book crowd here in Halifax . Great guys . <p> here 's a bit of back story . I was asked by director Jason Eisener to come up with a logo for " this thing he was making for the SXSW Grindhouse trailer competition " back in 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer and I cracked up at its content , awesome cuts and obvious homage to independent action flicks of the 80s . I had very little time , so I put together this logo for him which they liked so much they kept for the theatrical release . <p> I even designed the logo for The Plague , which will also be appearing in the film . Keep your eyes out for it . <p> Fast forward , the boys ended up winning the SXSW Grindhouse Trailer competition and started the process of making the full length feature film . Our whole crew lost our minds when we heard Jason managed to slate Rutger Hauer for the lead role , goddamn Roy from Bladerunner ! The boys even fought to shoot the whole movie in our hometown of Halifax/Dartmouth . As you can well imagine , we are all mighty proud of these guys for keeping their work home-grown , adequately putting our little city on the film map , shotguns ablazing . <p> I worked on this poster for about 2 months . I knew early on that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something painterly like film posters from the 80s . I started researching guys like Drew Struzan , Bob Peak and Bill Sienkiewicz to get a good idea of the style in my head . I also did a lot of drawing up front because I had no idea how to approach this beast . Did I bite off more then I could chew ? Absolutely , but my stubbornness reigned supreme as I was n't about to throw in the towel . <p> What I was aiming for was a weird mix of digital and analog . I did n't  want this poster to look like a " Photoshop painting " with obvious digital brush stokes and smooth edges . It needed to look like I beat the hell out of a canvas yet included computer effects and photographic elements . " Digital , yet not digital . But . . . digital ! " . I 'm my own worst enemy . My PSD file reached 230 layers at close to 5 gigs as I kept all of my digital paints separate for fear of messing up . Many hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a detail shot of the digital paints . <p> Stay tuned as I will be posting some behind-the-scenes images documenting my progress as I worked on this beast . <p> Here 's Jason hard at work in his studio . Grass roots , this is the way to go . <p> If you surf any film sites you probably woke up today completely inundated with the action-packed teaser trailer for the upcoming Hobo with a Shotgun . You might remember seeing the first trailer as the winner of the SXSW Grindhouse trailer competition , judged by Robert Rodriguez himself . Well , we finally have our first look at what to expect in the full length Hobo . Warning : if you are around uptight coworkers turn the volume down . <p> This is n't just a plug for a cool movie , but Jason Eisener is a pal of mine from right here in Nova Scotia . Him and his awesome crew have been hard at work creating Hobo for the big screen , and even managed to grab Rutger Hauer as the lead role . On top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film local , shooting everything in Halifax and across the harbor in Dartmouth . If there 's one thing I admire most about Jason and his crew is how grassroots they are , you can tell they have a real " get it done " attitude . They 're doing what they love , and that 's damn cool . <p> One more bit of nerdy trivia about this one , I designed the logo for the movie . Jason asked me back in the day to design him a logo for the SXSW contest , and the crew liked it so much that it remained intact for the full movie . <p> A proud day for Dartmouth ! Check out this fake movie poster for CASEY JONES by my good pal Eric Miller of the Dartmouth Clothing Co . Eric is known around these parts has being the creative force behind is clothing company , but this time he stepped outside of his comfort zone to learn some new skills and create his first movie poster featuring that badass from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Being a tight-knit pack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just imagine if our pal Jason Eisener ( HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN ) directed this thing . I 'd start camping outside the theatre right now . <p> Ive been hanging out with Eric more and more these days , always super pumped to hear what he has on the go . He runs the Dartmouth Clothing Co. in much the same way I run Signalnoise just do what you love , man . He showed up at my door 2 days ago with a 24+36 of this beast , melted my face clean off . Apparently he gave one to Jason- himself- last night and he " freaked the f*ck out " . - He has a great write-up on his blog along with some reference shots and other goodies , so go have a look . <p> As 2011 comes to a close , I wanted to post a kind of- " best of " - wrap-up article that 's relevant to the content of my blog . I know 2011 brought some new readers to my corner of the internet so presented here is a rapid fire , pared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories behind them . A rough outline of this years work . 2011 seems to have blown by at hyperspeed , but it was a big year for all of us . <p> Here we go , the Best of Signalnoise 2011 . <p> January 2011 : Year Zero for OFFF Barcelona I was asked by the kind folks who were organizing OFFF Barcelona to contribute a piece to their publication which was available at the conference . I decided to take an illuminati approach to the idea and put together this futuristic , neon-clad- pyramid . It landed proudly in the Year Zero book , and was the first big- appearance- of hot pink and " brush text " in my work . Something I would revisit throughout the year . <p> February 2011 : Signalnoise Poster for The Sword After seeing a tweet from my favorite metal band looking for an artist to create some visuals , I jumped at the opportunity with- ferocity . I set aside some hours one weekend and created this poster for The Sword , playing off some of the ideas of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the boys , I fired it off to them and they loved it . The poster was used for their Australian and- European- tours , and they commissioned me shortly after to design a t-shirt for their tour with Kyuss Lives . <p> March 2011 : Hobo With a Shotgun poster - It was a big year for Dartmouth . Hobo With a Shotgun was unleashed on the world by Jason Eisener and his crew , and I was asked to design a poster for them . I spent a lot of time learning new digital painting techniques for this one , really pushed myself into uncharted territory . The guys were thrilled with the result , and this was used as a little promo tool for the premiere here in town . I also designed the Hobo logo . <p> March 2011 : Help Japan - After the earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan on March 11th , I created the Help Japan poster in order to sell online to raise money for relief efforts . The design quickly went viral and spread all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising events around the globe and sparked an array of design efforts online to raise money for Japan . My poster raised $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross . <p> June 2011 : Signalnoise Identity Revision - I went through an identity crisis in the middle of the year and decided to do a refresh of my rainbow sun and Signalnoise wordmark . It was scary upon first launch because I 've become so used to my previous version , but after using the new mark for the last 6 months I can honestly say it was a good move . Much easier to use , and much more flexible for print . <p> August 2011 : The Explorer - This image popped into my head while I was running in a rainstorm to catch the ferry . Not really sure where it came from or what it was for , but certainly a poster design that I was proud of . It brought together a few new techniques I learned this year and was a fun , abstract concept to explore . <p> August 2011 : - Tutorial Culture vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between learning vital skills on your own through experimentation , and the saturation of online tutorials we see today . I talk about some of the issues that have come up , and how I relate that to my own creative development- throughout the 90s and 2000s . The article sparked a very interesting dialogue between new and veteran designers , a wonderful exchange of outlooks and ideas . <p> August 2011 : NASA Mission Patches - I decided I was going to challenge myself to do some logo/patches for NASA . This was a self-initiated endeavour to get me out of my comfort zone and dive 100% into Illustrator for a period of time . Ive been using Illustrator- consistently- since 95 , but the last few years its always been in- conjunction- with Photoshop . This project got into the vector world and , even though I could n't get NASAs attention with these , they were super fun to create . <p> October 2011 : Sad Mac in Steve Jobs- Commemorative- Newsweek- After hearing the news of Steve Jobs passing away , I created this little Sad Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man behind Apple . What started as my own little tribute , ended up being used by Newsweek magazine in their Steve Jobs commemorative issue gracing the entire inside front cover . This little guy still chokes me up a bit . <p> October 2011 : DRIVE movie poster - After seeing the film DRIVE I knew immediately I wanted to create a poster for it . I got to work and after a few days I finished my hot pink tribute to the movie . After its launch I was buried with comments , tweets and emails from people wanting a copy of the- unofficial- poster which was all very unexpected . After a little while of negotiating , my agent and good pal Ollie Judge inked a deal with Film District to make this poster official . I will be offering copies very soon , which I 'm pumped about . Stay tuned <p> November 2011 : The New FITC Identity While working on the creative for FITC Toronto 2012 , I designed a few logos along the way . The crew behind the event liked one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FITC logo being used across all events . Its not often that I get to design logos these days , so I 'm very proud of this one and was happy to help out my friends in the process . <p> November 2011 : Jay and Silent Bob Get Old Canadian Tour poster After seeing a tweet by director- Kevin Smith asking Canadian artists to submit any artwork they may have to be used as a tour poster , I jumped at the opportunity and designed this Jay and Silent Bob Get Old piece . It landed in front of Kevin who loved it , and it immediately evolved into a working relationship directly with the big man . I was- commissioned- to create a poster for his Plus One Live II event in London and am currently working on a big project with him involving 10 original posters . <p> Conclusion So what can be synthesized from all this ? I worked with a bunch of great clients during 2011 on some enjoyable projects , but everything I listed in the post shares a very important detail . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these because I wanted to work on them , because they meant something to me . I did n't  think any of these projects would grow into anything substancial , I just threw myself into them because its what I do . If you love what you do , it shows in your work , man . I believe that . <p> All of these projects ( and subsequent results ) are examples of what can happen if you take a chance , if you cultivate work using unconventional methods . These days , you need to be a renegade to achieve your goals . <p> This afternoon I gave myself an hour to do a digitally painted portrait , just to see what I could manage given the time constraint . I want to do more of this kind of work after using this process for my Hobo With a Shotgun and Drive posters . I completed this in 58 minutes , - despite- being- interrupted- by a- phone call . Rock n roll . <p> I knew right away who I wanted to paint , the main character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , played by the late Roy Scheider , based on a frame from the movie just after the sharks big reveal . <p> Here is an awesome spread of work by Londons own Tom Hodge , also known as The Dude Designs . I first saw Toms work when his official poster for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN emerged about a year ago and have been frequenting his site ever since to see what he s been up to . My favorite of his might be that- DEAR GOD NO ! - poster above . His work is fantastic and crazy , really dives into- independent- VHS cover art from the 80s back when covers and posters meant something . <p> But , were living in an interesting time right now . With the rise of artists like Tom , Olly Moss , Phantom City Creative , La Boca , Tyler Stout and the platform Mondo has built , we are seeing more attention being brought back to the art of the movie poster which has for too long been ruled by Photoshopped floating heads . This makes me happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely Jason " Hobo With a Shotgun " Eisener , I finally sat down last week to watch DRIVE . The movie was said to be highly stylized and quite a surprise in its execution and originality . It didnt- disappoint , loved every second . Every once in a while a movie appears where midway through I think- " Man , I 'd love to design a poster for this thing . " Obviously , that happened with this film , so I got to it . <p> Here is my unofficial poster for DRIVE , standing at an official 24 ? x 36 ? . I wanted to challenge myself to do something almost 100% digital paints , limited colour palette with very few effects . I used a similar process with my Hobo With - Shotgun poster , but streamlined everything this time around . Simplified the content . The film had a strong but modernized 80s vibe , and I really wanted to keep that flavour intact . Listened to a pile of Kavinsky during production hoping to infuse some Night Call into the design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies I created while planning things out : <p> This poster has been sent to the print shop and I 'm awaiting a proof as we speak .

@@121792537 @10792537/ <h> My Winnipeg Jets logo <p> As most of us Canadians ( or hockey fans at large ) know by now , our beloved Winnipeg Jets will be coming back to the NHL real soon . Being a hockey fan back in the 80s and 90s those Jets were part of our team , and by " our team " I mean being on this side of the border . Were a patriotic bunch up here and tend to cheer for our Canadian teams . So it was a sad day to hear that Winnipegs team was being packed up and shipped down to- Phoenix . Sad day indeed . <p> Well here we are . The Jets are back and us Canadians are pretty happy about it . I was cheering for you Peggers the whole time , hoping luck would swing your way and your team would come back . <p> Now for what its worth , I loved their old logo for too many reasons to list . BOTH of them actually . Simple , obvious and whatever else . Nice colors , somehow very Winnipeg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . <p> With the team returning to Winnipeg it was inevitable that they go through the process of a re-brand . I would have been- ecstatic- to see that old logo return as their official , but this is 2011 . Fat chance with all the re-brands that sports teams go through these days in the first place . Last Friday , Buffalo correspondent Paul Pants gave the word that theyd be releasing the new identity " in an hour " so I was pretty excited to see what they came up with . I was also a bit frightened <p> I 'll go on record here . Just personal taste so do n't  chew my head off . I have a pretty strong dislike for modern sports logos . It started back in the 90s when teams started going through all kinds of changes in identity and the logos moved away from the simple and iconic to these over-beveled , character-based , swooshing , snarling hunks of shit . They became- interchangeable- pretty quickly , and it was n't only with one sport . Baseball , basketball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No respect for individual identities or team legacy . I- completely- understand that design and printing technologies are far better than they were before , allowing us to do much more with jerseys and stuff , but just because we can does n't  mean we should . Logos transformed into illustrations . <p> This is why I was frightened while waiting for the new Jets logo unveiling . " What if its some jet zooming forward , shooting fire , with a big angry mouth on the front ? " Seriously , could have happened . I was pretty nervous . So when I 'm in a situation like that I always ask myself " What would I do if given the opportunity ? " . I fired up Illustrator and threw together a Jets logo that I 'd like to see on a jersey . That 's it at the top , and here it is mocked onto a player . <p> I 'm still tampering with the logo even as I write this post . I did it for fun . I did a Jets logo the way I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous identity , something you Winnipeg inhabitants might recognize and enjoy . Not much more to the story , really . <p> Just a little note in conclusion for what they did release as the new Jets identity . My first reaction was genuine relief . They did n't  go the direction of " crappy , hip , typical sports logo " and for that I send every thumbs-up I can to the team involved in creating it . Huge relief . It was obviously created with respect to the team and Canadian air force history . <p> Its catching some beef online and I 'm not sure it deserves it . Yes it looks a bit military , and I 'm curious to see the logo from afar ( like on a players jersey during a game ) to see if the design holds up , but it DOES NT look like a damn beveled raptor , or a silver shark or whatever that " thrasher " was supposed to be . Its simplified , plays off the Royal Canadian Air Force roundel , and has the leaf worked in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might get some stickers of this guy printed up . This ones for you , Winnipeg . <h> 15 Comments <p> As far as I understand it the military feel of the logo was meant to pay respect to the Air Force base in Winnipeg . I think its a cool tribute ! I 'm not quite a fan of the Jets typeface but that winged logo totally makes up for it . <p> This is a really great design James . In particular , I like that you stayed away from an angular look and went with the rounded effect . So many sports logos recently designed have so many sharp angles , its nice to see something different . <p> I like seeing what other designers have been coming up with as well . I thought that this design posted on Dribbble was pretty clever as well : <p> Patrick , you 're absolutely right . They spoke about consulting with the Canadian Air Force during the design , which is pretty cool . I only mention that because it looks very military , yknow ? Very serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look great on the shoulders . <p> Great write-up James , love your design . As far as the official one goes , I 'm not a raving fan , but its growing on me . Like you , I was relieved to see that it was n't your typical 90s-00s swooshy and trendy sports logo . The negative feedback online is typical knee-jerk reaction from the designers and non-designers alike . Those who do n't  like it because of the military association are just being silly . <p> I am curious to see , from a distance , how the jet and leaf look against each other . They may just morph into a blob , maybe some separation of the two could help in that regard . <p> Paul , I agree on all points , knee-jerk is a good way to put it . And the separation you mentioned is what I 'm thinking too . If you squint it kind of resembles the full maple leaf in silhouette , but need to see it in action . <p> I think I prefer your logo , actually , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one BECAUSE of the military feel , but I think they went too far into " Canada " and not far enough into " Jets " or " hockey " . Look at the real identity again and pretend it says " Canada Jets " instead of " Winnipeg Jets " it feels like it fits better , no ? <p> I also want to see it " from afar " the jet on the maple leaf in the circular version may or may not work , but I have to say , something about that notch at the top of the circle really grabs me . I dig it .

@@121792566 @10792566/ <h> Inspiration : Joshua Davis <p> I wear my influences on my sleeve , I always have . During school between 95 and 98 the internet was really starting to take off in a big way , and having access to so much information and imagery really turned me into a sponge . There were so many cool and innovative artists emerging every day and design portals were rising to the occasion of keeping designers and artists worldwide on the same page ( no pun intended ) . It was an important time for me because I was learning new art tools while experiencing new ground-breaking artwork from around the world . <p> So I figured a good mode of documentation might be to talk about the people who influenced me along the way as I created my own art and struggled to find my own voice . <p> I suppose Joshua Davis would be a good starting point . Josh came to fame by means of his personal Flash-art experimentation site called Praystation , and later launched Once Upon a Forest ( his art site ) and Dreamless.org @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were a lot of people experimenting with Flash in its infancy , but Josh stood alone in his methodology . Not only was he using Flash to create art , but he was also writing code to randomly generate new compositions . In essence , he was teaching a program to create art with bits of code and drawings he supplied , documented his day by day projects on his website , then supplied his source files for download . To this day he makes available his Flash source files on his workshop website , and teaches artists how to use the tools he has developed . <p> From time to time I will try creating artwork in a similar fashion , but it is more his process and theory that I enjoy . The loss of control he has over his artwork when the computer takes over allows it to take on a life of its own , as if he painted the wings of a butterfly but does n't  know how it will fly until he let 's it go . <p> In a field where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep their creative process a mystery , Davis openness about his art really makes him stand alone .

Above is a selection of Canadian NHL logos from the past and present , which I wanted to write about after reading Jakubs ( ISO50 ) post entitled Logo Upgrade Design fail Vol. 1 where he analyzes the unfortunate redesign of our coveted Toronto Blue Jays logo . <p> It seems most sports teams have fallen to the same design motifs over the past 15 years , a snarling cartoon mascot with thick lines busting through a wall . Nothing can hold a candle to the simplistic , smart designs teams wore , and in some cases continue to wear amid the constantly upgraded logos of today . These logos have become so ingrained in Canadian culture , specifically Montreal and Toronto , that a redesign is almost unfathomable .

Personally , I think you could add the old Leafs and current Boston logo to mix as they are both very well done . <p> As for the person that mentioned the Raptors logo , you are so very right . The good news is they are using the claw more these days and getting away from the dribbling dino . <p> So true . I agree that the sports team logos these days are created with far too much emphasis on merchandising ( not a bad thing , but the design is a fad and therefore fleeting ) . You 'll notice that the ones that stand the test of time and remain iconic are those that are simplistic and well thought out Toronto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen to this style either .

@@121792584 @10792584/ <h> Thoughts on the new DC Comics logo <p> Last night I saw the new DC Comics and DC Entertainment logos via Bleeding Cool , shown above . I spent the next hour or so scrutinizing this revised mark from top to bottom trying to formulate some kind of response , or just trying to make sense of it in my head . Instead , I just put out a tweet to see what my followers might have to say on the topic . <p> I was asked quite a bit last night what my thoughts were on this revision , so I decided to form it into a blog post because it seems the conversation is pretty heated , and ultimately 1-sided . The typical knee-jerk reaction to a big logo redesign is almost always negative , especially on the internet . Everyone thinks their opinion/idea is better than the one executed , so it quickly becomes a pissing match to see who can hate it the most using the most profanity . While at the same time , accomplishing nothing . I refer you to the Bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  feel DC really needed to pursue an identity redesign considering they launched their previous logo only in 2005 . It was met with mixed reviews , I dished out a few myself , but ultimately the logo did a great job of capturing youthful excitement ( we ARE talking comic books here ) and the animated version in their movie intro credits looked great . I was completely blindsided by yesterdays launch , and woke up today with the same confused feeling . In short , why the redesign and the departure from their established legacy ? here 's the DC Comics logo history : <p> The new logo is quite nice . Combination of the D unveiling the C is pretty clever . The page-turn looks a little bit like a sticker being peeled away , but I can see what they were going for and an animated version for their movies might look pretty good . I would love to see a process piece written to show how they arrived at this conclusion , and what designs may have went unused . <p> I was recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works at Strange Adventures , and he knows more about ( and loves ) comics more than anyone I know . He brought up that DC was looking to add more adult material to their comics because their audience had gotten older , ie. our generation of 30-somethings . But there are two problems here : 1 ) they would be completely disregarding the youth market who had supported them for decades , plus 2 ) they are turning off the longtime fans with all these sweeping changes to their beloved and familiar characters . This idea echoes in the new logo the kids are n't  going to notice it , and the old-school fans might feel abandoned . <p> Its a confusing move that has left me scratching my head . What do you think ? <p> Addition : DC has n't  made it clear exactly where this logo will be used . Of all my reading today , details have been a bit scarce . If anyone has any info , feel free to post . <h> 30 Comments <p> Redesigns are usually always met with harsh feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that people seem to be so completely averse to regardless of rationality . <p> That being said I actually quite like the new design as well , particularly the idea of the " D " &amp; " C " being joined and perhaps the " C " representing content that is revealed under page turn . I would also say that the cleaner chromatic look does also successfully meet the mandate of being something that would n't look out out place on products that are meant to reach upwards beyond current demographics . <p> I liked the 1976 and 2005 logo because they feel SO comic-booky but this new one may have some different tasks to take-on that DC may be preparing for . ( Perhaps they are preparing for more of an app approach ? ) <p> In summary , I think both Marvel and DC would be better off with just using Comic Sans haha -Reilly Newman <p> I do n't  like it , but its not a knee-jerk thing for me , nor do I have a better idea for a new design . I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had going was the 1976 Milt Glaser design . <p> It seems to me that for the most part a logo redesign is indicative of some desire to put distance between the perception of the brand then and change it now . Which is to say its nearly always an indication of failure . Writing this as a comics fan who 's up on the industry , DC is now in their 4th major in-continuity universe-changing reality destroying , " nothing will be the same again ! " promotion . Its also their fourth major change in direction in terms of managing the properties and trademarks they 've had . Since 2005 , despite some notable sales successes , they 've been throwing stuff to the wall and seeing what sticks . In face of competition from Marvel , DC has n't  been able to decide what they 're doing with the brand for going on 7 years . <p> I can see the logo functioning well as an animated icon for digital comics , but DC has already decided to handle that through Comixology rather than develop their own app like Marvel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes people drink it , but rather than develop a comprehensive brand strategy , they 're always changing things in hopes of finding the " magic bullet " that will move them into the number one sales slot for more than a few weeks . <p> For this particular logo I think it was a mistake to abandon the color blue . For my entire life DC has had a blue &amp; white logo . Even with the 2005 change , it still tapped into the same " brand reflex " that had been developed over a lifetime for comic readers . Marvel , red &amp; white , DC , blue &amp; white . I have to wonder if people in a comic shop scanning the shelves might not recognize particular books as DC comics now . <p> I think the design of the new logo is pretty great , however , it does n't  make me want to read comics . It looks more like a film distribution company logo rather than a comic book company logo . That logo is pretty sharp , though . <p> I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo up until that point . I really think they nailed it with that logomark . This new one does n't  translate anything fantastic to me . Maybe it will grow on me when I see the motion graphic before The Dark knight Rises . <p> I guess it comes down to those who view branding as the foundation and those who see it as paint . I think a cool new logo should stem from a proven need to rebrand , and it seems to me DC has decided they want to rebrand because of a cool new logo . Theyve existed for a long time ; their history should be strong in their brand . There 's much to be said about staying fresh . But , they can stay fresh and experimental on the pages of their product . I believe after such a long and proud tradition , there is more to say about remaining familiar . <p> Some great dialogue and comments . Thanks for taking the time to chime in , everyone . <p> Ive been reading some other articles outlining this redesign and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its perhaps an " app-friendly " approach . Once again I 'm led to a bit of confusion . Is the goal of this redesign to conform to the technology at hand , or the identity of the company itself ? I can completely understand the need to have a mark that works as an icon , but to strip a 70-year legacy for that goal seems strange . <p> Even though this new identity is quite clever , I am not a fan of it . This new identity , on its own , is well executed and has a very modern and simplistic look and feel to it . If this was presented as a corporate identity to the average business , most would jump all over it . <p> No , the reason I 'm not a fan is because its DC . To me , DC Comics are heroes , heroines , ambassadors of strength , the super , the evil , the passionate . The company represents everything amazing we can think of in our minds , and when we envision that ourselves in our own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This new version my satisfy the corporate entity in DC , but I do n't  think it does anything , yet , for the flag-flying masses of artists and fans it represents . <p> As an AD , I would have suggested another round of comps but that 's just me . <p> I agree with Reilly regarding the feel of the 1976 and 2005 logos looking and feeling comic-booky , which i would have thought that would be the direction they would want to continue in . When comparing those logos to the new re-design it feels like its lost that certain presence of childhood and fantasy . Maybe as suggested they are trying to move away from that in order to appeal to the older generation ? <p> It will be very interesting to see what the future holds for DC and where and how they are planning to take the company . <p> I think it would really help if we saw the logo in context before we pass total judgement on it . <p> Conceptually , its stronger than anything theyve ever done . Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " D " peeled back from the " C " carries that idea " its literally unveiling the " C " . Once were all too old to care , the guys like us all pissed about every poor design posted on the internet will like this logo . Its a good logo . It just should have been blue . That 's the mistake . Other than that , I like it . MGs logo ? Its fine . But its like how all top ten lists always say that Thriller by MJ is the best music video of all time . Or how Super Mario Bros is the greatest video game of all time . Clearly there are better music videos and better video games out there . But at the time they were genius . Same goes for MGs logo . It was awesome for the time . Now ? Well , there 's not really a concept ( other than strong queues taken from the super hero world : shield , stars , beefy font . ) It really can only rely on its visual merit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brands have to move on . That said , they could have stuck with the 05 . It was fine . But the new iteration is clever . Just make it freaking blue , and it will be radical . <p> Great points , David . I read in a few articles that there was n't any specific color combination trademarked , which means it might be left open to different palettes . So in that light , you 'll probably see that blue happen . <p> Good point about it revealing the " C " , like Clark Kent tearing open his shirt , revealing the " S " . I also agree that its a pleasant change away from the hyper gradients of their former logo . I will always love the 1976 one because that 's what 's on all my comics . The new one seems for refined , very well executed , has a terrific concept , and uses creative problem solving to give us a new design . Totally a win . <p> The problem " at least how I see it is this : If you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or entertainment in general . Whereas all previous logos either built on a legacy and brand recognition , or had enough " pop culture " in their design to indicate what it represented ( and FWIW I was never a fan of the 2005 logo , even though it does its job ) . <p> Okay , I 've thought this over . To put it simply : I think it works for the corporate sounding , umbrella company " DC Entertainment . " However , specifically for " DC Comics " the new logo is much too " corporate . " I think of DC Comics as a sub-brand to DC Entertainment ; having said that , using a derivative of the Glaser Bullet Mark would be more appropriate for " DC Comics . " <p> I cant help but feel a Dick Clark Productions vibe from this logo I know they do n't  look the same , it just does n't  work for me as a comic publisher logo and as a designer . For me , they 're trying too hard to be clever for clevers sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Simple , clean and save the clever for the title card before movies . <p> I 'd like to see the branding guide for DCs new logo how they plan to reproduce it in smaller sizes , single colour , and how this would look on a business card . <p> I think assuming that the initial grey scale logo was to be the final design was a bit premature . Having now seen the logo in colour and in context , here http : **40;354;TOOLONG , I think that it works well . Its an economic but versatile design . I think that DC have created a modern looking brand for their new modern product line . <p> I 'm not into comics , but I am into logos , and I think this logo is fantastic . Having just taken a quick look at the link that Mick posted , I 'm even more convinced . 100% successful , in my book . Versatile , conceptually strong , and aesthetically fulfilling . <p> FWIW , I would n't disagree with the fact that logo redesigns are frequently met with derision " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redesigns are garbage . e.g. AT&amp;T er at&amp;t , I suppose but I digress ..

These logos have become so ingrained in Canadian culture , specifically Montreal and Toronto , that a redesign is almost unfathomable .

Personally , I think you could add the old Leafs and current Boston logo to mix as they are both very well done . <p> As for the person that mentioned the Raptors logo , you are so very right . The good news is they are using the claw more these days and getting away from the dribbling dino . <p> So true . I agree that the sports team logos these days are created with far too much emphasis on merchandising ( not a bad thing , but the design is a fad and therefore fleeting ) . You 'll notice that the ones that stand the test of time and remain iconic are those that are simplistic and well thought out Toronto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen to this style either . Being a logo designer in Toronto myself , I see FAR too many logo designers using this cartoon like quality to their logos . WHY ?

Swing over to this post to read the little story as to what these are . <p> I 've seen these before somewhere , they are tremendous . Its amazing what you can do with just 1-color , there are way too many logos these days that are illustrations and not logos . Heavily illustrative logos usually do n't  work at smaller sizes and definitely do n't  work well in 1-color . These town logos put more complex logos to shame .

During school between 95 and 98 the internet was really starting to take off in a big way , and having access to so much information and imagery really turned me into a sponge .

There were a lot of people experimenting with Flash in its infancy , but Josh stood alone in his methodology .

Did you ever notice that the problems they discuss in life can be perceived rather deeply ? They are actually based on the ethical theories of John Calvin &amp; Thomas Hobbes . The differences between them and how each handles lifes problems . Wonderful how something as simple as a comic strip can have profound effects on our lives . <p> Brilliant .

Thanks for the flash-back . <p> This is great seeing so many great comments about Calvin and Hobbes , everyone . For being such a simplistic strip at face value , the quality and ideas presented obviously reach far beyond . <p> Martin , you 're right about the merchandising side of things .

This was my favorite strip growing up as well , and still today I love picking up one of the collections and cracking it open to a random page .

I arrived back in Dartmouth last night after attending FITC Toronto 2011 over the last 3 days , safe and sound . As with the previous 2 years , FITC was an absolute blast . I had a wonderful time presenting , sitting on a panel , meeting new people , seeing friends and just chilling out and talking about creative stuff with creative people . I have such a great time every year , and this was no exception . So recap , here we go . <p> I kicked off Day 1 with my presentation , Back to the Future : Part II . An amazing audience showed up to see me , maybe 200 big which was incredible . I really enjoy getting onstage , showing my work and telling stories , and this year I amplified the amount of content and detail I went into . I told my story starting at the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the present day , offering stories , advice and experiences along the way . HUGE thanks to everyone who attended , it really means a lot . <p> Later that day I got to see the mighty MK12 do a showcase of their awesome motion work , showing us some of their short films , a demo reel and generally goofing around onstage . These guys are a riot , and their work is totally badass . <p> MK12 onstage . Photo by Richard Budman <p> On Day 2 I was able to see Matt Rix tell the incredible story of my favorite iPhone game , Trainyard . When playing the game its easy to assume that it was produced by a company , but Matt took the entire process into his own hands and released a game that would knock Angry Birds out of the #1 spot in the App Store . A truly amazing and inspiring accomplishment . His presentation was detailed and very honest . Well done , Matt ! <p> Other presentations I saw that day were Gmunk presenting a sprawling account of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie Kosoy talking about the mighty Big Spaceship with a focus on their newest website The Most Awesomest Thing Ever , and finished up the day with some high-octane art physics with Robert Hodgin where he showcased his work and amazing new iPad app Planetary . What a great afternoon . <p> That evening I had the pleasure of hanging out with Jamie Kosoy and Jay Quercia ( both from Big Spaceship ) , Kat Gaskin and some other friends over some drinks . Had some great conversations which eventually led to a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles draw-off with the Big Spaceship boys . Hilarious . <p> And finally , a kickass Day 3 . I started things off with seeing Jason Theodor ( @jted ) do his presentation entitled How to Create More , Better , Different . Jason is excellent at breaking down the creative process and synthesizing creative " types " , specifically how they work and how they may improve what they do . I get more process and analytical advice from Jasons talks then any other , extremely informative and makes you think on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was done McBess took the stage to show us his process and ideas behind his incredible illustration projects and characters . His illustrations are amazing on their own , then he kicked into gear and showed us his motion and product stuff . Blew us all away , and what a funny dude . <p> I then had to opportunity to sit on a panel called Imagination + Source with Robert L. Peters , Jason Theodore and McBess where we answered questions from Owen Brierley to a packed room . It was a lot of fun to hear the diverse answers coming from such different professional backgrounds . We had some laughs as well , really fun time and it was awesome to meet and sit with these guys who I respect so much . The day ended with an amazing presentation by Kyle Cooper , the guy responsible for the title credits for Se7en , Iron Man , Alien , Superman Returns and a million others . Even got to shake his hand . <p> From there it was off to the To Japan with Love art show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was absolutely incredible across the board , showcasing art created by both students and veterans alike . Such great diversity . A great crowd showed up too and I met some very nice folks at the show . Big thanks to everyone who attended and donated for the event . <p> And finally , you guys . One of the best parts of FITC is meeting and hanging out with people I only know through the blog and broadcasts . Putting a face with a name is always an amazing experience and I met so many people at the event and after-parties that I 'd be at a loss to name them all . However , a HUGE thank-you to everyone who attended my talk , the From Japan with Love art show , the panel and all those who stopped to say hello during the parties . You 're an amazing bunch , and I miss you already . 
@@121792618 @10792618/ <h> Reckless Love Album cover <p> If you follow me on Twitter , you might have seen me talking about the Finnish rock band Reckless Love over the past few months . The 4 boys in the band , Olli , Hessu , Jalle and Pepe hired me last year to create the bands visual identity including the logo , a couple of cd single covers and their official label debut album cover . <p> I 'm happy to announce that their debut is due to be released on February 24th , coincidentally my birthday ! Shown above is the final album cover design I created for the guys . <p> I mentioned this in a previous post about the band , but there is nothing better then working with someone who is excited about their project . That makes me excited , and inevitably makes the work better . Reckless Loves sound is inspired by hard rock and hair metal bands from the 80s , polished and updated nicely . So naturally , the design hearkens back to that era being inspired by bands such as M+tley Cr++e and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album for a little while now as I worked on the designs and I really ca n't wait for the release . Its construction is honest , and they capture perfectly the elements of fun from the era that inspires them , without any irony . Its no secret that I love modern updates of things past , so I 've enjoyed every second of working on this project . <p> Max , that is crazy ! Oddly enough , I 've never seen that cover before . The Reckless design was influenced mostly by the Van Halen cover shown above ( centered metal logo , 4-panels ) but I certainly can see why that Wasp design came to mind , especially the colors . I just did a search and I guess that image was on the back cover of an album ? <p> Also , and to a lesser extent , Poisons Look What the Cat Dragged In was another influence . Check it . <p> James , I 've been a fan of your for quite some time . I was originally drawn to your work because of your effective use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retro-futurism around the same time you were as well . This cover is stellar .

Brian <p> I 'm really not sure why people keep ripping on this . James has , once again , nailed a style perfectly . He knows what he s doing , why he s doing it , and how to do it better than its been done before . And given the way that James talks with and about his clients ( especially Reckless Love ) , its difficult for me to believe that hed be content to produce anything " soulless " . <p> As usual , awesome work James . I 'm looking forward to whatever else you share with us here . <p> I 'm loving it as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutly love the design style looking back . Modern-Retro is so much fun to look at these days when its done right . And you do it right . <p> I just read a recent post by you on Twitter and was wondering if this was the collection of posts you were talking about . If it is , you 're right . The internet allows people with no talent , no creativity , no morals or common sense ( which is n't so common these days as it is ) to be obnoxious idiots anonymously bashing people and their hard work with no worry of retaliation .

@@121792621 @10792621/ <h> Year Zero for OFFF Barcelona <p> I will be attending and speaking at OFFF Barcelona 2011 in June of this year , which I 'm really looking forward to . Not only is it the second time I 'll be visiting Europe , but it will be an excellent chance to meet up with people in that part of the world whom I only know through the web . Ca n't wait . <p> As part of the festival , the OFFF team will be releasing a book based on the theme of the event , entitled Year Zero . The above image is what I created for them , playing on the idea of a modern day digi-pop version of the all-seeing eye , wrapped in an 80s rock vibe . I even went as far as to create a companion piece , the 80s magazine advertisement promoting a television that " thinks for you " . Its based on a real ad . Yeah , creepy . <p> I had lots of fun working on this one , even though it took me a little while to really get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simple , I wanted a kind of Bladerunner atmosphere mixed with the typography from the poster for They Live . <p> I spent a great deal of time messing around in Illustrator , trying different color schemes , layouts and elements as I tried to find the proper combination before moving to Photoshop to assemble things . One of the errors I tend to make is moving to Photoshop too early without having a good direction in mind , so this time I put in the hours to ensure that would n't happen . Here is a sampling of my vector sketches . <p> That final sketch was the one that set me on the right path , so I began putting things together in Photoshop where I added all my lighting , effects and textures . The one elements that I wanted to spend some time on was that digital eye , it had to look sinister and big , and ultimately look electronic . I used a hexagon pattern I built a while ago in Illustrator and used a simple eye design as a rough guide . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pretty fun when it all came together . <p> The final elements added to this design were actually the people . I wanted something to add a sense of scale to this thing , to make it look larger than life . I already had the staircase built , so the silhouettes were added to make everything feel far bigger and ominous . I spent a crazy about of time adding spot lighting and glows to this one because the pyramid structure itself is n't made of very many shapes , and I wanted some interest in there . <p> So , if you are attending OFFF Barcelona this year look for this in the Year Zero book . Ill also be looking to get posters made of this in the near future once I have it properly re-scaled for the larger format . <p> Given the content of the piece its obviously not a rendition of a scene that would exist in the real world , so messing with the elements of reality ( in my opinion ) is totally acceptable . I like the idea of lightning coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars were added simply because they brought interest to the top portion of the design . <p> I totally see where you are coming from , but I 'd rather bend the rules a bit to convey the idea . Basing everything on reality can be , well , a bit boring . <p> Jack , Year Zero is the theme and title of the OFFF book they are publishing for the event in Barcelona . I mentioned this in the post above . We were tasked to create a concept and image based on the idea of the book . See here . <p> My concept was to take the name Year Zero and spin it into an apparent branding for control , and playing off the idea of obedience through broadcast . The first piece is a more symbolic art piece ( using the pyramid and Eye of Providence ) while the second is a more " real world " application of reaching the public through magazine advertising . <p> Not usually into posting , but after reading a couple of comments above I just have to say I-m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Jack and Paricia , whose work I-ve never seen in my life . <p> The above was sarcasm , since you seem to take everything so literally . <p> Thanks James for all your generosity and the broadcasts , wich are amazing . Best of lucks with all your endeavors . Inspiring work man . <p> I have been to that Temple ( the Temple of Rock ) and I can report for everyone that James nailed the perspective . On the real temple the main stairs are very steep and they angle outward from the main chamber because , well , they 're stairs . The floating triangle/all-seeing eye has a flat front , but I can see why people might have been confused about the perspective . <p> Also , the jet propulsion required to keep the triangle aloft creates water vapor ( steam ) underneath ; hence the clouds and stars simultaneously . And when a high pressure system rolls in it is not uncommon to get some lightning strikes , like any tall building . The original builders elected not to have a lightning rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a shockingly accurate illustration of one Rocks greatest achievements , and I am amazed at your attention to detail ! Well done ! <p> Maybe they 're all just pissed about the poor audio from the " Montreal Meets " broadcast ? haha jk <p> I love this piece ! your textures and lighting effects are top as usual and the concept is bone chilling , I hate even thinking of the illuminati and an electronic version of the all seeing eye that well executed only fuels fire to the fear haha . You would n't be a freemason by any chance ? If so .. will there be a mason brother discount available ? because I 'd be interested <p> A question about the ZERO type : did you paint your own letters with a chinese brush or used some existing type resource ? I remember Dafont has a " Gantz " type a bit like that . Just curious cause I went in a similar direction some time ago . <p> James I really love that one ! I cant understand the comments about the wrong perspective The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job great . Keep on going like this bro ; ) Greetings from Germany <p> James its awesome ! the bright orange pink palette looks so fresh and new . I wonder how you made ZERO type ? I mean that " they live " effect , do you paint it by hand in Photoshop using some artistic brush or something like that ? <p> I appreciate that there is some negative feedback , its impossible to please everyone and its nice to see they 're analyzing the work like that .

I came across the strip quite by accident in grade 8 when I ordered " Yukon Ho ! " from Scholastic because I thought the cover looked funny . I was always looking for new things to draw , this kid and his tiger might be fun , right ? <p> Little did I know at the time how much of an impact Calvin and Hobbes would have on me , and that I would still be reading and appreciating it almost 20 years later . I identified a lot with Calvin and his hair-brained schemes that never worked or got finished . I was a lot like him at 6 years old , without the destructive behavior .

But now I can appreciate more the dialogue , in particular the strips where Calvin and Hobbes are in the wagon and Calvin presents a florid depiction of life and experiences before the wagon crashes and Hobbes cracks a joke .

I cant remember what strip it was , but Calvin made reference to his one summertime responsibility was how much fun he needed to cram into every day before his mother called him in for the night . I remember those days . That 's why I chose the images above , they are nice calm scenes with Calvin and Hobbes doing what they loved goofing off and creating adventures in their own little world . <p> In its medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Seinfeld .

I have read Calvin &amp; Hobbes as a child but learned something even more interesting when in an Ethics class at college . Did you ever notice that the problems they discuss in life can be perceived rather deeply ? They are actually based on the ethical theories of John Calvin &amp; Thomas Hobbes . The differences between them and how each handles lifes problems . Wonderful how something as simple as a comic strip can have profound effects on our lives . <p> Brilliant . I had most of the treasuries when I was a kid and have managed to hold onto a few . One of my favourite scenes , visually , was when Calvin was messing with his dad while getting his photo taken , including sneezing at just the right time . That stuff had me rolling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobbes .. one of the things I most appreciated with Bill Watterson , was how he never folded in over the commercial aspect of punting these two beyond the strip .

" Joy " best describes the resulting after-affects . Interesting reminiscing about those sessions is giving me a subtle high . Thanks for the flash-back . <p> This is great seeing so many great comments about Calvin and Hobbes , everyone . For being such a simplistic strip at face value , the quality and ideas presented obviously reach far beyond . <p> Martin , you 're right about the merchandising side of things . Watterson wanted to protect the integrity of the characters and their world , so we will never see them on mugs or calendars . He fought and fought with the syndicate to maintain the rights , and he won . Very inspiring story . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss thee . This was my favorite strip growing up as well , and still today I love picking up one of the collections and cracking it open to a random page . As I have grown up , I appreciate the writing and artistry more than when I was a kid . When I was younger , I identified with Calvins ability to live in his own little world , making snide commentary on everyone else . <p> for me Calvin and Hobbes is as big as Schulz- Peanuts . The Strip is one of the greatest in its genre and it influencend me a lot on how i see things and think about things . i-m very happy to own the complete edition : D <p> I agree with all the above !

@@121792627 @10792627/ <h> The Signalnoise logos : 1999 2008 <p> A logo should be simple enough to be easily remembered and recognized , yet be unique enough to distinguish itself and convey its message . That being said , the hardest task I have ever taken on as a designer was developing my own logo for Signalnoise . I would like a design one day , then dislike it the next . <p> So here is a look back at my different Signalnoise logos , the first of which was designed in 1999 when I was 22 years old . As I learned different tools and techniques , while being influenced by the new and exciting art I was being exposed to , the style of my logo was swinging wildly all over the place . <p> It was obvious that I was unwilling to let the skull design drop , so seen here is the symbol in a number of incarnations until I eventually landed on the winged skull that I have been using for the past few years . <p> A number of these logos can be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graveyard . <h> 8 Comments <p> Ive been struggling with designing a logo for my own purposes for the last 5 years .

I often wonder if I should stick with a logo because I am trying to create some form brand identity or should I change it because I am never satisfied . <p> I like logo no 5 . I am a sucker for communist era based design . But I could understand in practicality how it might be difficult to use , especially on business cards and your website . <p> PKayne , you bring up a good point . Continuous evolution is a very important part of being an artist , which kind of goes against the idea of a brand or logo ( which is important to have lasting power ) . Ideas and styles can shift very frequently so its very difficult to design a logo to sum up every facet of ones personality . Being too close to a project can be a curse sometimes : )

Yep , this beast of a film was released back in 82 when I was 5 years old . After doing the DRIVE poster late last year I knew for my next work I wanted to dive into the past a create something I loved as a kid . When- Mystery Box asked me what film I wanted to create a poster for , this was my first pick . They worked their magic , and were just waiting on a bit of red tape . <p> I was n't allowed to see FIRST BLOOD when I was a little kid . My parents said it was too violent so they would never rent the VHS for me , but I always caught little snippets of it when I was over at friends places . This , of course , made the movie even cooler because it was outlawed in our house . Something dangerous . But toys- werent- out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rambo toy knife kit out of a comic book , and I got the Rambo figure for Christmas in 86 .

He s typically depicted with a big gun of some sort , but I knew for my poster I wanted that knife front and center . My favorite parts of FIRST BLOOD take place out in the woods as he s beating up cops and the local makeshift army . Very natural scenery , with a Canadian tie as it was shot outside of Vancouver in a town called Hope . Other than- sporadic- outbursts , Sylvester Stallones character is relatively calm and determined during the movie . You never knew when he was about to cut loose .

As some of you know I did my first poster drop a week and a half ago for DRIVE and it was- turbulent- at best . I hit snags at just about every step and lost quite a lot of sleep as I tried to smooth out the- speed-bumps- I encountered along the way .

Quig <p> Kiren , so funny that you brought up the white " Stallone " . It was white right up until the last second then I switched it to red .

@@121792642 @10792642/ <h> Signalnoise identity revision <p> Here is something that has been inevitable and has been on my mind for about a year or so . When I launched my t-shirt line a year ago it was my first big attempt at printing in a new medium , more specifically , paying for each color when screen printing . If you 're not laughing now , you should be , as its clear that was n't taken into account when I designed my full-spectrum logo in 2008 . So as I went about designing things for the t-shirt line I realized how inflexible my rainbow sun was . <p> Not only did it involve 6 colors , but all those colors overlapped creating an additional 6 colors , 12 in total . In screen print land this is a nightmare to deal with as the t-shirt company needed to overlap the 6 colors manually to create the full 12 . While it looked okay , this created inconsistencies with my brand colors which I always had a problem with . I started looking at brands such as Johnny Cupcakes , Coudal Partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was obvious that I needed to make some adjustments in order to get the Signalnoise identity more flexible . Something that will still look cool with the spectrum , maintain the overall shape that has been mine for a few years now , yet be more usable in different product areas . <p> Also , the 1-color version of my logo . Ive been wanting to get into producing other Signalnoise products ( such as pens , key-chains and other cool swag ) but a big factor is printing in 1 to 3 colors to reduce cost . When I flattened my logo it looked like a flower . Lame . Ca n't deny that . All the circles blended together into one big flat , uninteresting shape . I never liked that 1-color version of my logo , to the point where I was reluctant to use it anywhere on the web and printing . It had to change , and that was that . <p> And lastly , my Signalnoise wordmark . Ive been using the Agostina wordmark for just over a year now and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining that cool modern vibe . Its a fun typeface to work with for sure and I still really dig it . But I started to reconsider recently when going over the new product ideas . Would it look good printed really small , like on a pen ? Does it center well on a shirt ? Does it work properly as a title with additional content below ? The answer to those questions was mostly " no " . The stylized Signalnoise wordmark was always a bit awkward to work with on stickers , shirts and other stuff which is why you rarely saw it outside of the website masthead . It all comes down to function , man . <p> Over the last 3 years I 've been adjusting the typefaces used across my brand , starting with the website . I used Egyptienne for quite a while because I always liked that face , but slowly moved over to a san serif , standardized design . When I felt the need to redesign my Signalnoise wordmark , the selection was clear . My beloved Akzidenz-Grotesk . Sturdy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I spent a considerable amount of time kerning the wordmark to have it flow properly . I was taught what kerning was in school , but never HOW to do it . Huge thanks to all the kind folks on Twitter who helped me out and gave advice as I tweaked it up , specifically to those who referred me to this article . Mega help , thanks gang . <p> The one thing I never like to standardize is how the logo and wordmark play together . I like having the flexibility to move each element independently in consideration of where its being displayed . Here are just a couple of combinations and I 'm sure others will present itself as I continue : <p> In conclusion , I need to make one point clear . I love my rainbow sun . I love the colors , how they blended , and its basically the only logo I ever designed for myself that I liked . Feeling the need to adjust it was painful . I knew it was coming , I knew it was necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . I did it delicately , and stared at the final for a week and a half before making a decision . This was a sensitive process . In the end , I feel I hit that elusive middle ground of new flexibility while maintaining the elements and form I loved most about it . And all it took was shifting the circles . Weird how the simplest approach is sometimes the best , huh ? <p> James , the identity revisions look great ! Really interesting read on your logic behind the change . Kudos to you for placing function first , surely the sign of a mature designer . You set a good example re : substance over style . Also , excellent choice on the Aksidenz . Noticed you use it few times before and its become my fav sans . Really powerful and diverse typeface . Well done dude <p> The logo still looks great and captures the colour scheme you originally designed . Its a shame about the font as I thought that Agostina really lent itself to your retro style but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither of these changes dramatically detract from the brand but enable you to advertise yourself easily and without those printing issues . <p> Another way to look at it . Your logo is expanding and evolving itself reflecting that same process you 're going through with your work as a designer . : ) <p> While I understand your reasons for doing this and your reasoning is certainly sound I cant help but lament the lack of personality of the wordmark . You did a good job of customizing the Agostina font before so the plain implementation of Akzidenz Grotesk feels a bit dry . it just is n't you if you know what I mean . And yes , the logo does resemble a religious symbol a bit . it might be because I live close to the Jewish Quarter in Krakow but it definitely reminds me of some Jewish festival artwork . Also a revolver , which is much more metal : - ) <p> Nice pick on the Akzidenz font I was a fan of the previous font work , but if you 're going for branding that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also kind of sad to see the original sun go , but the new one looks great , and you get to maintain its look in one colour . Great work , as per usual . <p> This is great ! The power and versatility of a one-color logo mark is unrivaled in the graphic world . I 'm happy you worked out a solution that you 're happy with . You are always your toughest client . Go rule the world with that thing man : ) <p> Dude , I love that you 've decided to make your brand work on a variety of mediums . The updated sun mark looks tight . And in really small sizes ( the footer of your site ) it still has that colours blending together vibe . Actually , this newer version definitely has a more old school 70s/80s network branding vibe that you love so much . <p> You can get this logo printed onto a wax seal now or on a leather stamp and do some sweet embossed goods . Or a cool rubber stamp . Or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your very own badass Green Lantern Corps ring . ; ) <p> As much as I love Agostina Im glad you moved on . You cant do much with it . But , I cant stand Akzidenz Grotesk ( mostly because I had to use it for a client project ) and would rather have seen a more utilitarian typeface like Gill Sans . But that 's just personal preference . <p> Still , the new identity works well . And its miles better from all those newly redressed DC super heroes that are getting a big relaunch this September . ; ) <p> James , I really think you hit it out of the park with the logomark . It is a perfect evolution of the mark . It especially works better at small sizes than the original and , as you said , much nicer in 1-color applications . One thing Ive always believed in is that , when combining a a wordmark with a logomark , only one should be the dominant element so that there is no competing effect . Both examples you have shown do just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend . <p> I seriously appreciate all of this feedback , everyone , both positive and negative . Its really interesting to read how people are interpreting this revision in terms of form and function . Like I said , it was a tough call to make things more usable from a print perspective . Serious challenge and I value your input and dissections . <p> I think you really nailed it . The type and mark was very illustrative , it was recognizable , but it seemed not to echo the refinement in your work . You really distilled what your mark , and type was at the core . I really dig the new brand , I think its clear , concise , I think one thing that would be nice to see is application , through it on some stickers , tshirts , something tangible . <p> All in all , rockin it ! I love it , I think it can be placed in any medium and is much more clear of a clear brand ! Keep rocking the awesomeness . <p> I often wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo , except that I 've only ever seen full color designs from you . Now that you 're looking at doing 1-color processes for your branded product , I think your change was a necessary one . Youve done a great job keeping the spirit of your logo ( and its color-rich qualities ) in a more versatile layout . <p> Hi James , I have been following you as a designer for quite some time . I never felt your logo matched up with your level of work and personality , even with the new rebrand . I know you are a very hard working and talented designer , I think you can find something more expressive of your personality and the brand you bring to the design community . -T <p> I love both of the versions , granted I like the original a bit better cause I like the overlap effect , but i can understand where you are coming from when you talk about it being expensive to print 12 colours . I liked it so much , I even based my own logo for Pentaura on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Also , i think the text is too plain for my liking , it just looks too " Arial-like " , maybe do/use a more cursive one like the Agostina font . But apart from that , AWSOME ! <p> Once again , big thanks for all the feedback everyone . Regarding the color blending of the previous version , I completely agree . I really enjoyed that spectrum with all its nice colors bleeding one to the other . If everything were printed digitally I 'd have zero problems , but unfortunately it just would n't work and was really hindering how it could be used . Total jam and I 'm sad to see it go . Hard decision to make . <p> But greener pastures , you know ? The new version will open up a lot of doors with new products , which is where I want to be . Pros and cons , man . <p> I think this a good revision , the looks much more proffesional and its indeed much easier to print . But do n't  really know about the font .. Agostina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which you certainly are ! ; ) Truth is that the Agostina is not suitable for body text .. I know you like the Akzidenz Grotesk but it does n't  have much flair in my opinion . Though taking a font with flair means less serious , depends how you want to look from the outside . ( The flair will come when they meet you : P ) <p> All together I like this new logo , it means business and kicks ass ! Good revision ! I can see this logo on your future shirts/posters and other stuff to come ! Great ! ! <p> Love the new mark I cringed a little when you brought out the original sun mark because of its inability to really print in a single color . This new one solves that problem and actually creates a pretty cool negative space , lending to recognizability . <p> On the other hand , I am totally saddened to see the wordmark disappear in favor of something as bland as Akzindenz . I love Akzidenz for minimal , international-style designs ( and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in a logo where personality is key . This is particularly true when the treatment is so standard . <p> If this were on Brand New : On Logo : Great . On Wordmark : Fine . On Execution : Great . <p> James , I think it works and feels much more balanced . The extra negitive space along with the typeface work great together . Nice job and I think this will work much better in the long run at any size and color . Great work , thanks for sharing . <p> hey james . I think Self branding its one of the hardest disciplines inside graphic design . i think you handled great . although , in my perspective , one thing ive noticed : the symbols circular motion and dynamics are somewhat lost in this redesign . by departing the circles , they lose their attraction and the whole shape gets a square feeling . I hope you do not take this opinion the wrong way ! <p> I think its a really nice change James ! Ive been a fan of your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo , but this new version is still very good . Although I cant change my mind about the font , I prefer the Agostina . <p> your solution was a perfect extension of the original design . it now looks better designed , and that 's not always easy to do . often , changing something that was " complete " takes away from it . not in this case . ( except 6 colours of ink. ) good work as always . <p> Totally get the change in the sun logo , quite honestly I always wondered how you were able to get away with that . Bit bummed about the font change though . Its just SO generic , which is retro in its own way , but its a really boring sort of retro .

@@121792648 @10792648/ <h> Hobo With a Shotgun poster <p> Ive been talking about working on this poster for a couple of months now , and I 'm super happy to have been given the green light by the hobo boys to launch it . Here is the Signalnoise poster design for the upcoming film Hobo With a Shotgun . Ive been waiting close to 3 years to work on this thing , so I was thrilled when Jason and Rob asked me to get rockin on it . I have known Jason and Rob for a few years now , meeting them through the comic book crowd here in Halifax . Great guys . <p> here 's a bit of back story . I was asked by director Jason Eisener to come up with a logo for " this thing he was making for the SXSW Grindhouse trailer competition " back in 2008 . He sent me a cut of the first Hobo trailer and I cracked up at its content , awesome cuts and obvious homage to independent action flicks of the 80s . I had very little time , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much they kept for the theatrical release . <p> I even designed the logo for The Plague , which will also be appearing in the film . Keep your eyes out for it . <p> Fast forward , the boys ended up winning the SXSW Grindhouse Trailer competition and started the process of making the full length feature film . Our whole crew lost our minds when we heard Jason managed to slate Rutger Hauer for the lead role , goddamn Roy from Bladerunner ! The boys even fought to shoot the whole movie in our hometown of Halifax/Dartmouth . As you can well imagine , we are all mighty proud of these guys for keeping their work home-grown , adequately putting our little city on the film map , shotguns ablazing . <p> I worked on this poster for about 2 months . I knew early on that I wanted to do something different from the typical film poster , something painterly like film posters from the 80s . I started researching guys like Drew Struzan , Bob Peak and Bill Sienkiewicz to get a good idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawing up front because I had no idea how to approach this beast . Did I bite off more then I could chew ? Absolutely , but my stubbornness reigned supreme as I was n't about to throw in the towel . <p> What I was aiming for was a weird mix of digital and analog . I did n't  want this poster to look like a " Photoshop painting " with obvious digital brush stokes and smooth edges . It needed to look like I beat the hell out of a canvas yet included computer effects and photographic elements . " Digital , yet not digital . But . . . digital ! " . I 'm my own worst enemy . My PSD file reached 230 layers at close to 5 gigs as I kept all of my digital paints separate for fear of messing up . Many hours and Photoshop layers later , the final poster emerged . here 's a detail shot of the digital paints . <p> Stay tuned as I will be posting some behind-the-scenes images documenting my progress as I worked on this beast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poster Ive seen in well forever . I like the old school feel to it , but then elements of your futuristic pipes and shards . There are so many people doing minimalist movie posters right now but your poster shows that when you put effort into the detail the work really shines . <p> Killer piece ! Well worth the wait . It looks absolutely fantastic . Awesome that they got Rutger Hauer to play the lead role . Very curious to the other behind-the-scenes stuff and your talk about this at OFFF man . <p> This has got to be up there with one of my favourite pieces of your work ! ! Love the detail ! It could so easily have been over-crowded but you 've managed to show all the elements perfectly ! Great stuff ! <p> Great workInstead of a single bullet hole , I would have peppered the text with a few smaller holes ( shotgun style ) . As it is , a single bullet hole represents a rifle or pistol , not a shotgun . Looking forward to your breakdown of this work ..

Pick an ability , you cant have them all " <p> I guess the creator of Superman never had a pal beside him comparing heroes ha ha . <p> This happens to everyone . The problem is that drawing takes far more time and effort and , in most cases , cleanup . <p> It is sad . I used to draw prolifically . Now , I have n't drawn much of note since I was required to in college . I 'm hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have other crap to accomplish and a limited lifespan ! : ) <p> Another good article , thanks James . Your absolutely right , I use to sketch here and there and scan them but did n't  like the result on screen . Maybe Ill start trying again , but most definetly helps with ideas . <p> Sounds like most of us are in the same boat . Whatever that creative outlet we had that led us into the industry normally gets squashed under school work , client work or whatever . I 'm no different . Its all about making that conscious effort to keep it in rotation . . . try drawing for an hour a week to start . Very satisfying , better than meditation . : ) <p> 2 things I wish I did more , that I used to regularly , are drawing &amp; playing the guitar . Using your hands directly to make a mark or a sound is so much more creative and satisfying than the digital realm . <p> I do n't  know about anyone else but I think the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try , to learn and so much to do with so little time that the computer always wins you can work so fast and the results are more attractive to clients . I " sketch " a lot of roughs in Illustrator these days a habit I swore I 'd never get in to . <p> I have considered doing a life drawing class again , the rigidity of a class at set times often provides the only way we in which we can focus ourselves . Self regulating such things can be very difficult , often we are forced to re-prioritise on the hoof . <p> I used to dedicate a certain amount of time a week to both but in the words of Homer " I used to rock n roll all night and party everyday . Then it was every other day . Now I 'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky . " <p> Sack it , I 'm diggin out my Wolfgang and slamming a few riffs out to get me in the mood to work later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I miss the old college days when I did n't  have a computer or a tv . All I had was my guitar , a cd player and a drawing board and a large number of pencils . Went through about 8 drawing books in my first two years at OCAD . Drop the mouse and step away from the electronic box people ! Find your roots ! <p> This is brilliant quality stuff . Its awesome to see this type of work from you , because you would n't be able to see this part of your diverse talent looking at your online portfolio . KEEP SKETCHING ! ! ! As more and more people become photoshop savvy and even hacks like me can follow complex PS tutorials ; the demand for such " hand made " art will skyrocket . Bottom line . Anybody can purchase PS and follow a tutorial , Most people can not draw , paint or sculpt . Please continue to develop these unique gifts and talents .

" <p> This is the second poster I have designed for the IYA2009 , the first of which being for the 100 Hours of Astronomy event that happened this past April . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating back to the first . <p> So , be sure to aim those telescopes skyward in October to observe the tiny ink drop our planet resides in . Space is the place . <h> 6 Comments <p> These are excellent designs . The Galileo poster first reminded me of the intro credits for Star Trek : The Next Generation , where the casts faces are composited onto footage of planets . Very cool reference ( if it was intentional ) . I also appreciate how the same poster gives you the sense of the planets being brought close with the juxtaposition of an earth-bound object ( tree ) and the planet . Its kind of a foretaste of what happens when you look through a telescope . <p> The second poster is just perfect for the subject matter . Its got this sort of Alice in Wonderland-Harry Potter vibe going on that 's kinda trippy ! It imparts a sense of childlike wonder and a desire to explore . I 'm sure the clients were thrilled ! <p> These are wonderful . I work at the Space Telescope Science Institute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telescope , and it is great to see such great work in the astronomy community . These designs maintain a sort of " down to earth " feel without being cliche , which can happen a lot with astronomical designs . Great work ! How can we go about getting one of these for the office ? ! <p> So I was sitting in the physics student lounge today when I noticed the pile of these posters on the table , and thought wow , for once the physics department is involved in something that has good taste in design and then I saw the SignalNoise logo in the corner and it all made sense . <p> Good job , but there 's something wrong in the face . I feel like it should be curved on the sphere .

I had a Skype meeting with a client yesterday and he sent me a link to another artist he was working with , a fellow by the name of Nook from Brooklyn , New York . Beautiful work full of nice desaturated backgrounds , pink glows and beautiful overall lighting treatments . He is no stranger to cool projects , and has worked with the likes of Wired , IdN , Nike , BET , Pepsi and others . <p> His work is confusing at first glance where you wonder what you 're looking at . Is it illustration ? 3D ? All Photoshop ? Its actually a combination of 2D illustration with 3D modeled backgrounds , which I 'm sure is no easy task to blend together . Check it out :

Here are a bunch of my favorite metal logos , both new and old . <p> One of my favorites is #6 , a logo used by Swedish death metal band At the Gates .

My recent works have been heavily influenced by television promos from the 1970s from networks like NBC , CBS , ABC and PBS . Some of these bumpers were created before the computer was used to animate in 3D space , while others were created at the dawn of computer generated graphics . Networks wanted to create bright and bold animated logos with the charm of 70s design . <p> The above graphic is made of simple snapshots of some of these wonderful animations , and it is easy to see the spectrum being used in bold and creative ways . NBC was really the front runner in my opinion , using the spectrum to animate their peacock logo .

@@121792701 @10792701/ <h> Fighting Fantasy book covers <p> here 's one for the old school super-nerds . When I was in grade 6 back in 1988 my friend Scott brought some adventure books into class one day and the things caught on like wildfire . By " wildfire " I mean within the confines of myself and about three of my other friends . While the girls were reading Sweet Valley High or whatever , this is what the guys were into . Monsters , swords and fire . <p> Shown here are the covers of 10 Fighting Fantasy books created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone . Remember Choose Your Own Adventure books ? Well , these were like the upgraded version where you kept track of stamina , strength and powers as you battled various monsters along the way . Even needed dice to read these things . So much fun . I have fond memories of playing through some of these books , and dissecting the killer artwork on the covers . It was just recently I started thinking back to these , and the art really holds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that Phantoms of Fear title ! And I love- the colours on the Vault of the Vampire cover . <p> Hell , Fangs of Fury as a 2-headed fire-breathing snake !

If so , you were obviously with the popular crowd . <h> 12 Comments <p> Oh I remember these fondly . The first one I bought was The Seven Serpents in the Sorcery ! series I remember finding it in a small bookshop that was on my route home from school . Totally felt like the kid from Neverending Story and that I 'd somehow stumbled on a mysterious tome that was a portal to another world . Magic indeed ! here 's the cover of that particular gem : http : //goo.gl/Ul2AO <p> Yes , remember them fondly . My school teacher gave me one after we read The Hobbit . Went on to play the Lone Wolf series ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look them up ) , but have a fondness for the old school classics , And yes , some fabulous artwork . I particularly like Freeway Fighter , Rebel Planet &amp; Temple of Terror . <p> Ah man this brings back memories ! ! In the uk I do n't  recall those exact books but we had something similar , I spent hours in the school library when I should have been working but instead I was flicking through an amazing adventure ! The best bit was to the average teacher it looked as if I was really studying ! ! Good times ! ! ! <p> Island of the Lizard King was my first one , art by Ian McCaig ( long time master fantasy artist ) . I read/played through that book a hundred times , eventually , between the ages of 10 and 12 I collected most of them . City of Thieves was the last one I got , and the rules and gameplay was expanded upon and more elaborate , the world itself was more developed and detailed too . <p> It was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something , MANY fond memories . <p> Reminds me of the Scary Stories books too .

The Night Dragon and Fangs of Fury text was hand drawn although the Curse of the Mummy text was one of the first I did in Illustrator .

This piece is influenced by some of my favorite metal acts spanning many sub-genres of the sound . <p> Metal has had its ups and downs in terms of design over the years , but I love the ambient brooding nature some bands are taking their work over the past few years . The style is pretty prevalent on labels such as Hydrahead and Ipecac , and I first started noticing it with bands like Pelican , Isis , The Red Sparowes and Boris . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trees , mountains , etc mixed with brooding architecture and form perfectly captures the essence of this new breed of sound . <p> Here are a few shots from the Fo Sho Poster Show and Silent Auction which took place at the Gallery of Design at Arizona State University on Monday , November 17th . The show was organized by fourth year students and judging by the turnout and sheer effort that went into the event , it was a resounding success . <p> I 'm happy to announce that the latest installment of Computer Arts magazine , issue 156 has been released and features the tutorial I wrote entitled Creating the New Retro .

Check out the demo here . <p> I built Forge a couple of years ago , inspired by the engines Joshua Davis builds to create his artwork . Being the art control-freak that I am , I needed a tool that would help me relinquish some control over the elements I use and allow them to move and shift on their own , thus introducing me to new arrangements that I had n't  previously thought of . I am certainly not a programmer , so I had to look up a pile of tutorials and examples online before I finally got the engine to do what I wanted . <p> The programming behind my engine would probably make developers gag , or laugh , or both . But as clunky as Forge may be , it has performed like a champ . So check out the demo to see how the engine works , and hit Refresh a few times to see that no two arrangements are the same . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , images of abandoned factories and warehouses that have been left at the mercy of nature . The work of people reclaimed by the land they were built on . <p> The wreckage inspired me to re-open my Forge engine . I created a number of abstract shapes based on the shadows of the abandoned factories , in dark corners or gloomy doorways , and fed them into the engine to see what compositions could be created on the fly . The Black Glass pieces were constructed using many outputs of shapes , layered on top of one another in an organic process where the composition build itself ( in a way ) . <p> Here are some examples of what the engine spits out after I give it the shapes to handle : <p> I will be experimenting more on this to see how I can use the assets in different ways for different outcomes . <p> Its no secret that us Canadians love our hockey .

Its normal for me to feel like I 'm floundering around trying to find direction , but looking back at this year I can see a more focused vision despite starting off on the wrong foot . <p> So here we go a look at 2013 and some of the highlights the year brought . <p> February 2013 : - Vintage console illustrations After a year of trying to design movie posters , I decided to give up on the dream out of sheer frustration . This time of weird upheaval led to me creating a bunch of original illustrations of vintage game consoles , in a style that was very much new to me .

Truly a dream job , IDW even catered to my silly whims and printed the illustrations with spot gold foil on the helmets . Had loads of fun doing these . <p> April 2013 : - Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon The best client project I ever worked on . Dean Evans , my 80s brother , brought me onto the project and together we developed the logo and " box art " that would represent Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon online . A teaser was launched on April Fools Day which caused quite the " Is it real ? " fiasco online , instantly capturing an audience . Signalnoise was swept up in the excitement as my art flew all over the world . Way too much fun on this one . <p> May 2013 : - Hangin with Kurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe MAX , my good buddy Russell Brown arranged an awesome little dinner party with his photographer friend Greg Gorman .

Certainly a high point of 2013 . <p> May 2013 : - The Great Discontent interview I was honoured when my favourite design interview site got a hold of me , The Great Discontent .

@@121792715 @10792715/ <h> Fighting Fantasy book covers <p> here 's one for the old school super-nerds . When I was in grade 6 back in 1988 my friend Scott brought some adventure books into class one day and the things caught on like wildfire . By " wildfire " I mean within the confines of myself and about three of my other friends . While the girls were reading Sweet Valley High or whatever , this is what the guys were into . Monsters , swords and fire . <p> Shown here are the covers of 10 Fighting Fantasy books created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone . Remember Choose Your Own Adventure books ? Well , these were like the upgraded version where you kept track of stamina , strength and powers as you battled various monsters along the way . Even needed dice to read these things . So much fun . I have fond memories of playing through some of these books , and dissecting the killer artwork on the covers . It was just recently I started thinking back to these , and the art really holds its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that Phantoms of Fear title ! And I love- the colours on the Vault of the Vampire cover . <p> Hell , Fangs of Fury as a 2-headed fire-breathing snake ! How could I not be into this what I was 10 ? <p> Sorry about the low image quality , these suckers were hard to track down . Anyone else out there read these when they were kids ? If so , you were obviously with the popular crowd . <h> 12 Comments <p> Oh I remember these fondly . The first one I bought was The Seven Serpents in the Sorcery ! series I remember finding it in a small bookshop that was on my route home from school . Totally felt like the kid from Neverending Story and that I 'd somehow stumbled on a mysterious tome that was a portal to another world . Magic indeed ! here 's the cover of that particular gem : http : //goo.gl/Ul2AO <p> Yes , remember them fondly . My school teacher gave me one after we read The Hobbit . Went on to play the Lone Wolf series ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look them up ) , but have a fondness for the old school classics , And yes , some fabulous artwork . I particularly like Freeway Fighter , Rebel Planet &amp; Temple of Terror . <p> Ah man this brings back memories ! ! In the uk I do n't  recall those exact books but we had something similar , I spent hours in the school library when I should have been working but instead I was flicking through an amazing adventure ! The best bit was to the average teacher it looked as if I was really studying ! ! Good times ! ! ! <p> Island of the Lizard King was my first one , art by Ian McCaig ( long time master fantasy artist ) . I read/played through that book a hundred times , eventually , between the ages of 10 and 12 I collected most of them . City of Thieves was the last one I got , and the rules and gameplay was expanded upon and more elaborate , the world itself was more developed and detailed too . <p> It was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something , MANY fond memories . <p> Reminds me of the Scary Stories books too . I read those as a kid and get so immersed in them , THAT artwork hold up well , soooo creepy . <p> I worked on the Fighting Fantasy series as part of my first job as a designer at Penguin Books back in the late 80s in London . <p> This was mainly pre-Mac and much of the artwork was done on boards with typeset content . The Night Dragon and Fangs of Fury text was hand drawn although the Curse of the Mummy text was one of the first I did in Illustrator . It makes me shudder looking at these just how bad the typography looks today ! : - )

@@121792733 @10792733/ <h> Help Japan : 2 years later <p> If you know me at all , you 'll also know that I do n't  discuss my Help Japan poster very often . Of all my posters and designs it was the one that reached the furthest , was seen by the widest audience , and- galvanized- charitable funds far above my expectation . This all happened 2 years ago and its taken me this long to approach the subject- publicly , and personally . <p> I create lots of stuff , the size of my portfolio is proof of that . So when something happens where I think my creative efforts may help , I 'll give it a shot . That 's what happened on the morning of March 11 , 2011 when news reached me about what happened in Japan . I made something to raise money , much the same as the ladies in the seniors home who held a bake sale around the corner from my house . I 'd sell my poster via my online store and donate the proceeds to the Canadian Red Cross . A simple little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within an hour my poster went viral . <p> I started getting- phone calls- from the- New York Times- and other big publications. - The response was intimidatingly positive as I started setting up the print run , ordering shipping supplies and enlisting friends to help me with all the work . A LOT of work , hundreds of tubes to be packed , processed and shipped but it was definitely worth it given the cause . I could n't believe it . <p> Then the unexpected happened . Even if you have the best intentions possible , sometimes things can come out of left field to give you a knock . When a story , video , or piece of art goes viral it breaches the bubble of personal audience and goes out to the general online public , which exposes you to not only the positive , but to the negative . Its no secret that the negative screams louder than the positive , especially with the anonymity of the internet . This was a harsh reality hit me head-on . <p> Each morning during my time packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blog comments from those who took it upon themselves to tell me I was doing something horrible . The remarks were almost- frightening , ranging from harsh design critiques , cultural differences and personal attacks on my character . They 're all still live here and here , if you need some context . For a time I was even scared of answering my own phone . For a freelancer working alone out of a small home office , this wasnt easy to deal with in the least . But I kept forcing the bigger picture into my head : the good cause . <p> This is when Fast Company decided to rear its head . In this article entitled Is This Poster to Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? , John Pavlus took it upon himself to voice his opinion about my- charitable- endeavour . It should be noted right away that neither Fast Company , nor John himself , contacted me for a statement prior to posting the article on their very well-travelled website . A pretty key mis-step in- journalism- I would well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Unknown to anyone but myself ( and close friends ) , this article alone caused the most damage to me and my campaign , igniting not only a new round of harsh emails and comments but this time , from within the design community . A field I love and respect . This alone caused me to almost shut down the campaign . <p> Despite all of this , the campaign was seen through and raised around $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross as I shipped posters out of my basement . I said earlier , far and above the original little idea . <p> So , why am I writing this 2 years later ? Its not out of disagreement with nay-sayers and its certainly not an attempt to garner sympathy or encouragement ( seriously , please withhold comments of that nature , guys ) . Ive been running this blog for 5 years and Ive always felt a certain responsibility to my audience ( specifically designers ) to discuss the industry through experience , as transparently as possible . We all have ups and downs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 2-fold <p> First , be careful . If your main goal is for something to " go viral " in whatever form , be careful . Your work will be reaching a much wider audience and in some cases people wont think twice about voicing harsh opinion several times over to a complete stranger . Growing a thick skin only comes through experience . Even though you have the best intentions , your truth might get contorted and thrown under the bus . So be careful . <p> And second , stick it out . If you are doing something with nothing but the best intentions do NOT let those people stop you , whether they are anonymous critics or writers on respected websites . If you 're doing what you believe in , and you 're doing it for others do n't  let an elusive negative force stop you , even if it sticks with you well after the fact . <p> 2 years later , I 'm thinking hard on all this stuff and despite the harsh language directed toward me , my design and my campaign , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the amount of money you raised from that campaign , James .

I came via Twitter , thanks to an " Abduzeedo " retweet . <p> I understand how this whole thing might have overwhelmed you in the past . You 're right about how things grow enormously when they go viral and escape of your control , but I think there 's no need to take bad comments too personally . I 'm aware how designers and artists behave , as I consider myself a designer ( worse or better ) , and you and me know we have a high and sensitive ego were always trying to feed . When nad comments show up , we tend to take it personally ( its understandable ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we believe in what we do . Cheers , James White . <p> Text-book semiotics . The difference between what the sender of a message intends , and what recipient of the message interprets can never be the same . Each interpreter brings a different universe of experience to the table when they decode a message . As ( visual ) communicators all we can do is attempt to be mindful of this phenomenon when we craft our messages and hope for the best . To let this prevent us from attempting communicate would result in the sound of one hand clapping . Well said Jim . Keep it up . <p> If I had to guess , you donated close to $20k more than all of those harsh critics combined . Its amazing that their reaction was attack someone who was trying to do good , rather than doing good themselves . <p> Kudos to you , James for quickly reacting to the tragedy and doing the only thing you could to raise a significant amount of money . <p> Anonymous online negativity is n't anything new , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what sparked it for the most part was the Fast Company article , supposed " peers " in the industry .

Ridiculous . <p> That was a lot of reading . I remember when you first posted this design and my thought at the time was , " Damn that is a nice poster . Good job ! " , and then " Dang .. the simplest ideas are always the best ones are n't  they ! ? " <p> In the aftermath of tragedies , such as what happened in Japan , emotions are high . Its a shame though that some people truly disconnect from logic and reason ( and empathy ) and reach out to attack instead of comfort . Its like their frontal cortex simply turns off . <p> A lot of these people mean well , and they donate because that is really all they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that is at the core of all these comments of discontent . <p> The poster was not something to be purchased so that one would revel in the suffering of others , but memorialize their pain so that the moment is simply never forgotten .

Sadly there will always be the negative naysayers who 's only job is to frustrate the rest of us by trolling blogs and making harsh comments . <p> I for one am simply not financially secure enough to drop everything and fly to Japan to help in the rebuilding efforts . Thankfully people like you help the greater community by creating art we can purchase , donate and remember . <p> One last thought . I am a Christian . So in my faith we hold the symbol of the Cross in high regard .

Thank you for your work and for donating your time , resources and energy to help those in need . <p> Hmm Sounds like that Fast Company article really stung you . Really , though , I think it helped the mission . You used your skills to put out a product that acted as a vehicle to help facilitate people donating to a worthy cause and raise awareness . At the same time this article gave a sounding board to those who had a moral conflict with that practice , BUT , for those people he still listed a link to your charity of choice at the end of the article . Its a win-win ! <p> The first time I saw your poster , 2 years ago , I was once again stunned by your design and I felt the urgency to do something to help . I believe many felt the same too . Design sometimes takes an approach to plea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative " images . Some NGOs , such as Green Peace , have posters of terrifying images . But I can hardly call yours negative . Of course the cracks , the strokes and the dust recall the earthquake , this is why everybody is struck by the visual impact . The abstraction and minimalist treatment bypass the exposure of the victims pain and meanwhile appeal to sympathy . <p> Here I would like to address the question of what to do with this poster ( even though it could be way too late ) and I hope my words would serve as some alternative view to this dispute . I can hardly agree with Mr. Pavlus in his article " Is This Poster to Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? " . I do understand that some people would n't prefer to hang this poster at home as a reminder of the natural disaster .

If someone speaks up like that it should happen with respect . I hope their moms taught them some manners . <p> You did the exact right thing buddy ! Keep it up ! <p> Cheers DAN-O <p> PS : Totally off topic , but it made me laugh out loud when I thought of what Draplin would-ve told those guys ; - ) <p> Wow .

Despite what this article and comments say , there 's no gray area here .

After looking through a few of my poster books I had on hand , Dave got on the web and brought the work on Richard Amsel to my attention . <p> I had seen quite a few posters by Amsel over the years , but never knew exactly which artist had created them . Dave brought up Amsel doing the poster for Raiders of the Lost Arc , which I always assumed was created by Drew Struzan . Diving into Amsels work last night was amazing , aside from him being a brilliant illustrator he has a sharp sense of design and use of white space . The girth of his portfolio blew me away . <p> It really is bittersweet to look through the works of Richard Amsel , Drew Struzan and Bob Peak .

I have been collecting vintage movie posters for 15 years and always enjoyed posters designed by Amsel and Struzan . To me though the best movie posters ever made were from the 1920s and 30s .

Most people would decide what movies to see by looking at the poster art . There was no television back then , just radio , newspaper , and posters . Enjoy collecting , its a great hobby !

@@121792742 @10792742/ <h> Help Japan : 2 years later <p> If you know me at all , you 'll also know that I do n't  discuss my Help Japan poster very often . Of all my posters and designs it was the one that reached the furthest , was seen by the widest audience , and- galvanized- charitable funds far above my expectation . This all happened 2 years ago and its taken me this long to approach the subject- publicly , and personally . <p> I create lots of stuff , the size of my portfolio is proof of that . So when something happens where I think my creative efforts may help , I 'll give it a shot . That 's what happened on the morning of March 11 , 2011 when news reached me about what happened in Japan . I made something to raise money , much the same as the ladies in the seniors home who held a bake sale around the corner from my house . I 'd sell my poster via my online store and donate the proceeds to the Canadian Red Cross . A simple little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within an hour my poster went viral . <p> I started getting- phone calls- from the- New York Times- and other big publications. - The response was intimidatingly positive as I started setting up the print run , ordering shipping supplies and enlisting friends to help me with all the work . A LOT of work , hundreds of tubes to be packed , processed and shipped but it was definitely worth it given the cause . I could n't believe it . <p> Then the unexpected happened . Even if you have the best intentions possible , sometimes things can come out of left field to give you a knock . When a story , video , or piece of art goes viral it breaches the bubble of personal audience and goes out to the general online public , which exposes you to not only the positive , but to the negative . Its no secret that the negative screams louder than the positive , especially with the anonymity of the internet . This was a harsh reality hit me head-on . <p> Each morning during my time packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blog comments from those who took it upon themselves to tell me I was doing something horrible . The remarks were almost- frightening , ranging from harsh design critiques , cultural differences and personal attacks on my character . They 're all still live here and here , if you need some context . For a time I was even scared of answering my own phone . For a freelancer working alone out of a small home office , this wasnt easy to deal with in the least . But I kept forcing the bigger picture into my head : the good cause . <p> This is when Fast Company decided to rear its head . In this article entitled Is This Poster to Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? , John Pavlus took it upon himself to voice his opinion about my- charitable- endeavour . It should be noted right away that neither Fast Company , nor John himself , contacted me for a statement prior to posting the article on their very well-travelled website . A pretty key mis-step in- journalism- I would well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Unknown to anyone but myself ( and close friends ) , this article alone caused the most damage to me and my campaign , igniting not only a new round of harsh emails and comments but this time , from within the design community . A field I love and respect . This alone caused me to almost shut down the campaign . <p> Despite all of this , the campaign was seen through and raised around $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross as I shipped posters out of my basement . I said earlier , far and above the original little idea . <p> So , why am I writing this 2 years later ? Its not out of disagreement with nay-sayers and its certainly not an attempt to garner sympathy or encouragement ( seriously , please withhold comments of that nature , guys ) . Ive been running this blog for 5 years and Ive always felt a certain responsibility to my audience ( specifically designers ) to discuss the industry through experience , as transparently as possible . We all have ups and downs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 2-fold <p> First , be careful . If your main goal is for something to " go viral " in whatever form , be careful . Your work will be reaching a much wider audience and in some cases people wont think twice about voicing harsh opinion several times over to a complete stranger . Growing a thick skin only comes through experience . Even though you have the best intentions , your truth might get contorted and thrown under the bus . So be careful . <p> And second , stick it out . If you are doing something with nothing but the best intentions do NOT let those people stop you , whether they are anonymous critics or writers on respected websites . If you 're doing what you believe in , and you 're doing it for others do n't  let an elusive negative force stop you , even if it sticks with you well after the fact . <p> 2 years later , I 'm thinking hard on all this stuff and despite the harsh language directed toward me , my design and my campaign , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the amount of money you raised from that campaign , James . I 've always felt the ultimate goal of any visual art is to make the world a better place , and if your efforts here even made the smallest impact in someones life , the project was successful . Well written response , keep doing things the Signalnoise way . <p> Hi , this is the first time I post a comment on your blog . I came via Twitter , thanks to an " Abduzeedo " retweet . <p> I understand how this whole thing might have overwhelmed you in the past . You 're right about how things grow enormously when they go viral and escape of your control , but I think there 's no need to take bad comments too personally . I 'm aware how designers and artists behave , as I consider myself a designer ( worse or better ) , and you and me know we have a high and sensitive ego were always trying to feed . When nad comments show up , we tend to take it personally ( its understandable ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we believe in what we do . Cheers , James White . <p> Text-book semiotics . The difference between what the sender of a message intends , and what recipient of the message interprets can never be the same . Each interpreter brings a different universe of experience to the table when they decode a message . As ( visual ) communicators all we can do is attempt to be mindful of this phenomenon when we craft our messages and hope for the best . To let this prevent us from attempting communicate would result in the sound of one hand clapping . Well said Jim . Keep it up . <p> If I had to guess , you donated close to $20k more than all of those harsh critics combined . Its amazing that their reaction was attack someone who was trying to do good , rather than doing good themselves . <p> Kudos to you , James for quickly reacting to the tragedy and doing the only thing you could to raise a significant amount of money . <p> Anonymous online negativity is n't anything new , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what sparked it for the most part was the Fast Company article , supposed " peers " in the industry . Lost all respect for them the day it was posted . <p> My pal Ryan ( of DesignChat ) had it out with them , and they seemed to barely care how much damage the article inflicted . Ridiculous . <p> That was a lot of reading . I remember when you first posted this design and my thought at the time was , " Damn that is a nice poster . Good job ! " , and then " Dang .. the simplest ideas are always the best ones are n't  they ! ? " <p> In the aftermath of tragedies , such as what happened in Japan , emotions are high . Its a shame though that some people truly disconnect from logic and reason ( and empathy ) and reach out to attack instead of comfort . Its like their frontal cortex simply turns off . <p> A lot of these people mean well , and they donate because that is really all they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that is at the core of all these comments of discontent . <p> The poster was not something to be purchased so that one would revel in the suffering of others , but memorialize their pain so that the moment is simply never forgotten . Are people up in arms over the our war memorials honoring our fallen brothers and sisters ? How about the memorials and artwork created in decades following the German Holocaust ? Sadly there will always be the negative naysayers who 's only job is to frustrate the rest of us by trolling blogs and making harsh comments . <p> I for one am simply not financially secure enough to drop everything and fly to Japan to help in the rebuilding efforts . Thankfully people like you help the greater community by creating art we can purchase , donate and remember . <p> One last thought . I am a Christian . So in my faith we hold the symbol of the Cross in high regard . This is not an object of worship , but a powerful symbol that reminds us of a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem with that memorial too . Yet it has endured as a reminder of what was lost and gained . <p> Excellent work . Thank you for your work and for donating your time , resources and energy to help those in need . <p> Hmm Sounds like that Fast Company article really stung you . Really , though , I think it helped the mission . You used your skills to put out a product that acted as a vehicle to help facilitate people donating to a worthy cause and raise awareness . At the same time this article gave a sounding board to those who had a moral conflict with that practice , BUT , for those people he still listed a link to your charity of choice at the end of the article . Its a win-win ! <p> The first time I saw your poster , 2 years ago , I was once again stunned by your design and I felt the urgency to do something to help . I believe many felt the same too . Design sometimes takes an approach to plea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative " images . Some NGOs , such as Green Peace , have posters of terrifying images . But I can hardly call yours negative . Of course the cracks , the strokes and the dust recall the earthquake , this is why everybody is struck by the visual impact . The abstraction and minimalist treatment bypass the exposure of the victims pain and meanwhile appeal to sympathy . <p> Here I would like to address the question of what to do with this poster ( even though it could be way too late ) and I hope my words would serve as some alternative view to this dispute . I can hardly agree with Mr. Pavlus in his article " Is This Poster to Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? " . I do understand that some people would n't prefer to hang this poster at home as a reminder of the natural disaster . However , instead of burning it , as suggested by Mr. Pavlus , they might put it up in the local community for fund raising or simply an appeal for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mind <p> Lastly I want to thank you for giving some much time and effort to this campaign ! Do n't  let the good intention be ruined by some others unkindness . <p> I will never understand such unprofessional behaviour as performed by this Fast Company guys . I mean , what would-ve been the downside ( for them ) of contacting you before the article was published ? That kinda crap never makes sense to me .. ever ! If someone speaks up like that it should happen with respect . I hope their moms taught them some manners . <p> You did the exact right thing buddy ! Keep it up ! <p> Cheers DAN-O <p> PS : Totally off topic , but it made me laugh out loud when I thought of what Draplin would-ve told those guys ; - ) <p> Wow . I read the part about " negativity " , and when I tried to imagine how what you did could in any way be perceived in a negative light , I must confess I came up short . <p> I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments to understand , and still have a hard time grasping the logic behind it . <p> I think you can rest easy knowing that what you did is 100% , unequivocally good .

The boys at the PCC did n't  even know this one was coming . Heh heh . <p> This was a bit of a strange undertaking since the screening is today and I started this poster last night . But the idea hit me so I just ran with it . Lots of fun . There 's a few relevant additions to the- hieroglyphs- if you look closely . <p> So if you 're over in London , get over to the Prince Charles Cinema ASAP to see these on the big screen . Believe me , I 'd be there if that annoying ocean was n't in the way . <p> Brilliant once again Mr White , youve a great knack for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm constantly moving about right now but as soon as I have a fixed address , I cant wait to collect a few of your posters .

I was hired by the kind folks at Wired last month to design some original type pieces for use in their article about the mighty Quora . Other then the direction " Make the letters look big and flashy " , I was allowed to come up with whatever I wanted . I experimented a bit with line work and halftones , something I have n't really done before now . Shown here is the 2-page spread ( top ) as well as two drop caps designed for the article . <p> My original version had crazy vibrant colors , and I have to tip my hat to Wired for making the suggestion of pulling the tones back a bit .

@@121792756 @10792756/ <h> Welcome back Toronto Blue Jays ! <p> So here 's the thing . I 'm a Canadian boy and , growing up back in the 80s and 90s I was a die hard Toronto Blue Jays fan . From the classic line-up of Bell , Gruber and Moseby right up until they won back-to-back World Series in 92 and 93 , I was cheering for my Jays . And you know what a big part of that was ? The logo which theyve used since 77 . <p> But in the late 90s it seemed the norm to " re-brand " sports teams like nuts . It drove me crazy because so many of the classic logos were perfectly sound without need of a re-design AND all sports team logos started looking the same . Some kind of angry animal or whatever busting through a wall . No respect for the legacy of the team just something the marketing people would say " looks cool " . Screw you . <p> My Jays were no different . In 97 they revised the classic logo which made the Jay look over-weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the World Series wins . Then in 2003 geez , I have no idea . A blue jay getting friendly with the Texas Rangers ? A maple leaf tattoo on his " bicep " ? Ugh . <p> And then in 2004 , full-on generic angry blue jay logo complete with the beveled " Jays " hunk o turd . Zero reference to 27 years of the clubs history . Looks like every other logo across 3 sports in North America . Being a longtime fan and a designer , this was a- disappointing- reveal when it happened . <p> In all honesty , I lost track of my Jays in 2004 mostly because the identity of the team , to me , was totally stripped . The team I had loved was gone and replaced by well , these guys . Yes , I understand players come and go as time goes on , but there was NOTHING familiar to me anymore . They even had black uniforms . Black uniforms on a team with BLUE in the name . <p> Why am I going on this tangent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The Toronto Blue Jays unveiled their new logo and uniforms and when I clicked the link to see , 7-year-old James cheered his ass off . After 14 years of seeing that other team playing the part of my Blue Jays , I was thrilled to see my guys come back . Kind of teared up , I 'm sure you can see why . <p> Theres going to be people whining about the new type , or line thickness , or colours , or that face that they think the Blue Jays suck , but I do n't  care . Keep it to yourself . <p> To whomever was in charge of pulling off the Blue Jays new identity , a huge high-five on this one . You brought them right back to when every kid in Canada was a Jays fan . Simplicity and respect will always win . <h> 7 Comments <p> This was a tremendous job by the Blue Jays organization , personally I love the type treatment . I also really love the illustration of the blue jay , not sure why someone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what the Miami Marlins did with their new *ahem* look . Hopefully Toronto can stick with this logo and not feel the urge to rebrand again in 5 years . <p> I so love the classic Logo and i am so happy the re-design has that classic feel to it . I-m not long into Baseball since i am from germany but i fell in love with sportslogos ans the blue jays especially ! Slickest Team in the MLB next season ! <p> The logo looks great but I agree with PJ . The stem of maple leaf looks better when it lines up with the ball . However , not a big deal because this logo still looks a million times better than the logo in recent years ! <p> Wow ! I love the re-brand ! Its fantastic , I had lost all hope as well , I disliked their logos since 97 . I like the typography , the bluejay design and the colors , very nice , glad they switched it back .

After looking through a few of my poster books I had on hand , Dave got on the web and brought the work on Richard Amsel to my attention . <p> I had seen quite a few posters by Amsel over the years , but never knew exactly which artist had created them . Dave brought up Amsel doing the poster for Raiders of the Lost Arc , which I always assumed was created by Drew Struzan . Diving into Amsels work last night was amazing , aside from him being a brilliant illustrator he has a sharp sense of design and use of white space . The girth of his portfolio blew me away . <p> It really is bittersweet to look through the works of Richard Amsel , Drew Struzan and Bob Peak .

I have been collecting vintage movie posters for 15 years and always enjoyed posters designed by Amsel and Struzan . To me though the best movie posters ever made were from the 1920s and 30s .

Most people would decide what movies to see by looking at the poster art . There was no television back then , just radio , newspaper , and posters . Enjoy collecting , its a great hobby !

@@121792762 @10792762/ <h> Signalnoise Studio Update : Spring 2010 <p> Its finally starting to feel like spring around Halifax . The weather is warmer , the ducks are back at the park , and the leaves are starting to make appearances . This is the best time of year to be in Halifax , if you live here you know what I 'm talking about . This time of year normally brings Spring Cleaning with it , and its no different with the Studio . Ill be working on a few changes , here we go . <p> The past 8 months or so have been great in terms of Signalnoise Studio getting lots of new work for great clients . I officially registered the company back in February and started jumping through all the hoops necessary in order to get things properly set up . A lot of paperwork , but I had some great people to help me out along the way who gave wonderful advice . I 'm still learning the ropes , but its going well . <p> But , here 's the thing . With so much client work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daytime hours as well as a lot of my own time , which is usually spent working on posters , writing for the blog , surfing for cool art , sketching ideas , writing emails . . . you know , the fun things that made my Signalnoise brand what it is . I understand deadlines reign supreme , but I found myself less enthused because I did n't  have that personal creative time needed to keep me excited and make me laugh . Speaking at FITC Toronto and having the Signalnoise art show was a wonderful break in the midst of all this because it gave me some time to represent Signalnoise on my own terms and meet lots of wonderful people as a result . <p> So , things are going to change around here . On June 1st I will officially be moving over to working at the Signalnoise Studio full time . Its daunting and a bit scary ( which I 'm told all entrepreneurs feel ) , but I think at this point its time to crank things up to 11 and see what this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive only worked at other agencies , so this is all new to a punk like me . Guess well see how it goes . <p> The one thing I never wanted to do was hang the Open sign in the front window , sit at my desk with a smile on my face and wait for business to come knocking . That whole scenario scares the livin hell out of me , to be honest . So Ive been working on a new department of the Signalnoise brand over the past little while which will take me in a bit of a new direction . I touched on this topic during my last Broadcast and I 'm busy aligning all the things necessary to get the ball rolling . This is n't a client-based project or collaboration , this is 100% Signalnoise . I cant offer many more details just yet , but the coming weeks will bring many updates as I document what is going on in all kinds of fun ways . Keep watch on my Twitter for little tidbits as well . <p> Another change is one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my blog writing , email replying and broadcast schedule went out the window and that really upset me . I always wanted Signalnoise to be a kind of hub for meeting and talking to other people who enjoy art and design to whatever capacity , so to have that put on the backburner really sucked . That being said , I 'm working on a more solid schedule of updates for the blog with new content and inspiration stuff , as well as implementing a solid bi-weekly Signalnoise Broadcast schedule to keep a more solid connection with everyone . This might even be upgraded to a weekly Broadcast when I get rolling , but well see . <p> That 's the scoop , gang . A few big personal changes coming over the next few weeks but I 'm looking forward to all of it . As always , thanks very much to everyone for swinging by the blog and broadcasts to say hello .

@@121792779 @10792779/ <h> 5 Years Ago <p> In 2007 after the release of my first and only book , I was trying to figure out what the next logical step in my career was going to be . I mean my " personal " career . I was working at an agency at the time but worked feverishly on my own little projects outside of the office . My book kind of summed up everything I did in my twenties and put all those unfinished projects to rest . And for a bit more perspective , I registered Signalnoise.com in April of 1999 . I was flopping around like a fish on the wharf during those 8 years trying to find my artistic voice . Inspiration without direction . For downloadable evidence see the Signalnoise Graveyard- and the myriad of Signalnoise logos . <p> I was hanging out with my pal Chris Toms one evening when I decided to start a blog . Nothing profound since blogging had been around for years prior , but I never considered Signalnoise to be a blogging platform . Maybe this new direction would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It was worth a shot . Within days Chris had me set up on his host and WordPress functionality was installed . On the evening of October 23rd , 2007 , I wrote my first meagre post aptly titled Signalnoise in development : <p> If you happen to come across this blog please be aware that it is under construction . I am currently building a better compatibility between my personal site and- my Flickr account . I 've come across a few wonderful Flash applications that make a seamless connection to Flickr accounts , something I 've been searching for . <p> So , thanks for your interest . Please come back for something better once the foundation is built . <p> What a knucklehead , huh ? In the days following I would write a few little posts on the creative process , started breaking down some of my personal techniques and experimenting with some different art styles . Again , nothing profound . I think I had 13 visitors on my site that month but I did n't  care . That 's when everything changed I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art for myself . I started having fun . I started to play . I started to explore . <p> For the first time in my career , Signalnoise.com had become to backbone of my work rather than just a display tool . I wanted to keep it fresh , which meant creating new art and content . They fed each other . A few short months later I was contacted by an up-and-coming design blog to do my first online interview . The email came from a guy named Fabio Sasso and his little Abduzeedo- website would expose my art to the world . <p> Why am I writing this ? Well , I get asked by a lot of students and design professionals about how I " did it " . And the truth is there 's no secret ingredient . I made a decision and stuck with it , started small with that goofy little post above and have been building Signalnoise pixel by pixel ever since . Back then I never would have guessed I 'd still be doing it 5 years later but I probably would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what counts . <p> So today I 'll be reflecting on the last 5 years and the ongoing journey with this little website . It just might get a little weepy. <h> 11 Comments <p> Wowser , congratulations James . Well I was a bit of a Johnny-come-lately as you know , but your blog has been such a huge inspiration to me , and I 'm sure heaps more folks will say the same . Well done matey , looking forward to seeing the next five years ( and beyond ) of the Signalnoise story . All the best . <p> I think the name Signalnoise first registered on my radar when I tuned in to a live broadcast ( wish I could remember which one ) after it had been linked up from a Twitter follower . Ever since then Ive continued to check out the site and your work that 's been coming out . <p> Its great to learn about how you got things together and how the site grew from your desire to explore and play , I can certainly make a few comparisons to that on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you truly work hard enough at something and are passionate about it , it will pay off in the long run . <p> Ca n't believe that 's how long its been dude ! That abduzeedo article was how i found your work and its been awesome watching you do you thing over the years ! Thanks for the inspiration on and off screen ! <p> I kind of discovered your art late , but thanks to the SNBC recordings I 've been able to keep up with your career and see how much you 've grown . Your passion for design is awesome as is the care you show for those who follow you . The only way to describe you and your work is by calling you inspiring . Congratulations ! <p> Congratulations ! I think the first thing I saw of yours was Reckless Lovesince then Ive been lurking around here and some of my other favourite designers/artists blogs and Ive finally decided to get more involved in the design community . <p> What you 're saying about designing/creating artwork for yourself " what inspires you and things you love " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on board because when you 're starting out a blog like I am its easy to think you need to create artwork about One Direction and Twilight to get noticed . <p> Thanks for the kind words , gang . I did n't  post this to garner any congrats , but I greatly appreciate it nonetheless . You guys are awesome . <p> I do a lot of reminiscing anyway , but on days like this it feels potent . When things started there was no grand plan , or action items , or business model , or whatever . There was n't even a real goal for the site , it was just something to encourage me to make stuff . Never could have anticipated the consequences , especially at the beginning . But I also did n't  care too much . It was just fun . <p> Way to go , eh ! ! ! I do not remember the exact date , but I have been tracking your progress for 4.5 years now , it is , so true , all it takes " One small step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said " Way to go , eh ! " <p> I remember stumbling into my first SNBC broadcast a few years ago , your passion and personality shined through . Started following your blog that day and never missed a broadcast since .

I was thrilled to see a full-on art show featuring the work of Australian-based art duo WE BUY YOUR KIDS . <p> I was captivated by their WRATH OF KHAN poster ( seen above ) earlier this year and found myself constantly hunting down the image online to " have another look " . So arty and psychedelic and weird . But the biggest reason I enjoy it is because it looks nothing like other Mondo releases .

The reason i like these ones is i think they have captured some of the mood or film concepts where as the others justwelldont . I feel some of the posters are too abstract to work , especially the Conan and Nightmare on Elm Street postersthough it works for the other ones i mentioned . But , then again , maybe i 'm just too attached to these films and they have clouded my judgement . <p> These are epic ! great styles . Interesting comment on them not working as movie posters .

The only thing I cant figure out is how you get your result in your design Do you take a printscreen or what happens next ? What if you have to make a A0 poster ? The resolution of a prinscreen will not be high enough to be useful Or do you get vectors and is everything scalable ? <p> Martijn , that is the tricky part .

Check out the demo here . <p> I built Forge a couple of years ago , inspired by the engines Joshua Davis builds to create his artwork . Being the art control-freak that I am , I needed a tool that would help me relinquish some control over the elements I use and allow them to move and shift on their own , thus introducing me to new arrangements that I had n't  previously thought of . I am certainly not a programmer , so I had to look up a pile of tutorials and examples online before I finally got the engine to do what I wanted . <p> The programming behind my engine would probably make developers gag , or laugh , or both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed like a champ .

The only thing I cant figure out is how you get your result in your design Do you take a printscreen or what happens next ? What if you have to make a A0 poster ?

Most of the emails , tweets and Facebook notes are asking the same questions so an official update on the blog is in order to get the information out there on all fronts . So , here 's how things will be going down . <p> The DRIVE posters are currently being set up over at Bounty Print in Halifax on their giant 6-colour Heidleberg press . They will be printed at 22 ? x 28 ? on Starbrite Velvet 80lb cover . Additionally , There will be a very small run of 24 ? x 36 ? oversized DRIVE posters available on semi-gloss poster stock . If you are looking at getting one of these ones on launch day I urge you to act fast as the numbers will be very low . <p> The Signalnoise Store will be activated on launch day to purchase the DRIVE posters . The absolute best way to get a head start is to follow my Twitter , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . To dispel any rumours , there is no lottery and the DRIVE posters will be available first come , first served . Mark your calendars . <p> If you have any questions , I urge you to ask via the comments on this post and I will update with any details needed . A huge thanks for all the interest in this design , everyone . This is the largest Signalnoise poster launch to date and the response so far has been amazing . <p> Very nice . Captures the aesthetic of the time period that inspired this film . Curious to know , are these posters done with " permission " from the film studio etc , or are you simply paying homage ? I 'm generally intrigued to know how these sorts of collaborations happen , or if they are collaborations at all . For instance , does the film studio require a cut of sales ? I understand if you 're not at liberty to say , but thought I 'd ask anyway were all here to learn ! Cheers . <p> Joe , this is an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the steps to get this thing official . A license fee is involved , as is the case with all posters involved with a franchise . I never sell anything without the proper permission of those who own the property . <p> Brandon , the largest the Heidelberg press can run is 22+28 . My original intent was to do a smaller size of 18+24 , but if I could get a larger size I was going to do it . Both are standard frame sizes . <p> I 'm wondering about the semi-gloss poster paper . I just have nothing in my collection printed on such paper . I hope i get a chance to see it in person . and I hope it rules as much as I expect it will . <p> Question : Will either size have a white boarder or are they printed to the edge ? <p> I realize this is a crazy suggestion in the poster world , but here goes . Since you think they 're going to fly off the shelves ( and inevitably wind up on eBay at a significant markup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there some rational reason for false scarcity , or is it just a part of the collector mentality that I 'll never understand ? Assuming I get one , I 'll cherish my Drive print just as much no matter if 300 or 3,000 other people have one . <p> Yancy , the edition of 300 has everything to do with cost . Before the posters even reach my online store I need to ensure I can pay for the production/shipping of them . I 'm a small , 1-man company so 300 is much easier to manage than 3000 . I need to know ( not assume ) that my products will sell before I produce them . Its a delicate balance . <p> When you say itll launch at " a random time " , will this be announced ahead of time ? I live in Australia and itll be difficult to stay on my computer all night pressing F5 hoping that I 'm on at the right time . A heads-up will make it fairer for everybody , but its your sale and I wont presume to tell you how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poster up for sale its a great design . <p> haha great . I 'm in love with your design and have had this site on RSS for weeks waiting for when you 'd announce that you 'd be selling this poster . But those prices are astronomically out of my budget . <p> With the high cost of these posters , I would hope a second run is not produced . Knowing you have one out of 300 ( or 30 ) , makes it more special in most peoples mind , than one out of 1000 . Please take a page from Mondo and create a limited edition collectible , instead of Sideshow Toys , who now takes pre-orders and then sets the edition size . <p> Or atleast if a second run is made , change up the colors or do something to identify it as a second printing ( like comic books do ) . <p> Either way this poster is great and really captures the feeling of " Drive " . <p> All the way from Sweden here . Hoping that you 'll do a second printing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where well be able to look out for more information if therell be a second printing or not ? <p> I cant believe Ive never seen this poster till now ! !

Youve made a good choice to go landscape with your final choice and it has a brilliant understated vibe going for it but there 's something I love about the action and light on the first .

The one I did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the official materials and composition . <p> This is probably your first work that I really do n't  like and I think its way below your usual level . Its too simplistic ( the smoke is just horrible ) and the composition looks like it was taken from a cartoon . I feel the poster really does n't  do the film justice . Sorry for being harsh , but that 's the way I see it . This style is not for you . <p> Love the poster , man . The landscape orientation allows for the illusion of motion with the smoke and the riders on horseback , have those elements oppose each other creates tension as well . Awesome job of storytelling , buddy . <p> James . First of all , I think its rad you 're literally living your dream . You must be so stoked . And its all so well deserved because you 're the hardest working man in graphic design . I never comment on your work unless I have something good to say . I have to break my silence on this one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Unlike Leukocyt ( such a frustrating name , dude . Seriously ? ) who 's just critical without any solutions . Ok , I think you made two mistakes but first , the positives : The detail you applied to the deputies and their horses is very nice . There are little bits too that share that same detail and visual language : the ground , the actual car itself , the trucks in the distance and Josh Brolin running away . Now here 's where I think you broke that visual language a bit " the smoke and the clouds . I would have connected more to the poster if you added more realistic detail to the smoke . Leukocyt ( seriously , change your name ) said it was cartoon like . Only accurate thing he said . I 'm not saying get in there and go nuts like Ken Taylor or anything . But you 're such a talented illustrator . I would love to see evidence of your raw drawing skills in those KEY features in your posters " like the smoke , like the lightning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that need more attention , detail and care . And I think more drawing and scanning to capture the forms more accurately . Because as it stands , the smoke very much reflects a process in illustrator and less a combined effort of hand drawn and then using illustrator to add detail . So , a bit down the Ken Taylor route , but not much . Just enough so that the horses and the smoke are now part of the same visual language . Same goes for the clouds . They 're not very realistic , yet they 're surround by visual elements that are . All in all , that smoke could have been fantastic . But is comes off a little flat . Not the set piece it could have been . I know you were going for story in this piece , but you still have to take care of business , right ? The second mistake ? The font choice . Is that Neutra ? I know its not Futura , but it still has the Wes Anderson feel . So its a bit more light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that dark indie comedy feel . That 's it . Sorry for the freaking novel .

But you 're such a humble , talented dude and I know you listen to us . So yeah , there you go .

He s more experienced than me and his work is very focused . <p> I will , however , voice my opinion about his work , because by positing it on a blog he gives me that very opportunity .

See the difference ? <p> Pawel , I think you 're missing the point David was trying to make regarding constructive criticism . Let me draw a simple situation here . You 're in the computer lab at school and a classmate is working on a logo or whatever . You walk by and pause long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that " and continue walking . Did you offer guidance or cite reference for improvement ? Was your classmate helped at all by your saying that ? If the answer is no , then you did n't  say that for their benefit , you said it to voice your opinion which makes it about you , not them . That 's the difference , and its a big one . <p> When you offer guidance ( no matter what your experience ) it opens dialogue , and that 's important . Everyone may not agree but at least there is some kind of anchor for why you feel that way . Leaving negative criticism just because you feel you have the right does n't  help anyone . <p> A design instructor told us a long time ago to always be positive , especially when your criticizing the weak parts of someones work . Good advice there . <p> I 'd normally let this stuff roll off my back as I 'm no stranger to negative comments , but I feel pretty strongly about being constructive as it seems there is less and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this together . <p> James , I really respect you and your work but intend to be an asshole in this case . <p> I did n't  get the feeling that you required feedback about this poster . I got the feeling you 're showing a finished piece . And since its finished you obviously deemed it " good enough " and with that I disagree . <p> As a general rule I do not tell people how they should do their work unless asked to . And I especially do n't  feel the need to give pointers to someone with such recognizable style as you . Therefore I 'm not here to offer " constructive criticism " I 'm here to say whether I like the poster or not . <p> I also do n't  feel the need to be positive about it , because were not 5 and this is not a crayon picture . We are adults and we can all take a beating every once in a while . <p> David did n't  provide constructive criticism . What he did is throw a few sweet lines your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is terrible he still likes it . And I quote " I never comment on your work unless I have something good to say " . Does it even need an additional comment . <p> You say that there is less and less constructive criticism and maybe its true , I do n't  know . What I do know , is that we have suck-ups in abundance and that is something I do n't  appreciate . Criticism is not about kissing ass of the big and famous its about what the name suggest criticizing . <p> You want constructive criticism then you shall have it . <p> The composition is unbalanced and you focus too much attention on text at the cost of the actual image . The colour scheme is muddled and in no way representative of the movies mood and atmosphere . Additionally , choosing black and orange in this day and age , when 3/4 of action movie posters use that combination is not a very good idea and gives people the wrong idea about the movie . The contrast between the background elements is too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too simplistic and childish which fits neither the poster nor the movie . The foreground lack details and looks like it was drawn with a black magic marker . You wanted to go minimalisitc with this and its apparent you are not comfortable with that style . <p> And if someone gets offended by anything I write here its all the better because at least it shows they care about something enough to get offended . <p> I say grow a pair and say what you really think instead of dipping everything you say in a sweet sauce . <p> Pawel , there 's a way to not be pretend-positive and still be constructive . Suck-ups are indeed in abundance and authentic criticism is needed , but your choice of words ( e.g. , cartoon , crayon , magic marker , etc. ) is needlessly condescending and not especially insightful , regardless of whether your point is taken . <p> This is a minimalist poster and more contrast to distinguish between planes in the background seems to run against the minimalist style . The contrast after all is bold where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . Verisimilitude is n't the right approach here . Regarding the palette : black , orange , and light sandy blue is neither ( a ) muddled , as I think it hits a fine balance of contrast and complement ; nor ( b ) deviant from the films mood/atmosphere . If you watch the film , blue and gold ( yes , like many of todays action movies ) is indeed a prominent pairing in many scenes , owing largely to the milieu . I 'm curious what exactly is the " wrong idea " communicated by the posters colors . For instance , I certainly do n't  see the poster and think , oh , this is going to be like the Transformers . <p> I 'm not a graphic designer or knowledgeable about that arena ( other than what appeals to me vs what does n't  ) and I really like your aesthetic in this one ( had a quick boo through the rest of your blog , too , and like that as well ) . I see what you 're saying about the mock-up with Javier Bardem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think its an extremely powerful image and really nails the whole story in one simple , powerful punch . When I saw the final version that you 're going with via Laughing Squid , I was " wow , cool ! what a great poster for that movie " , then I saw the other mock-up and was " oh , that 's even better , I hope that 's the one thatll be available " but sigh , not . Ah well . Neat stuff . Thanks for sharing your work and your workings I really enjoy the behind the scenes stuff with artists work ; it makes the final decision that much more interesting , to me , if I 've seen some of the process involved . <p> The point of a minimalist style is to strip away all the unnecessary elements in order to accentuate the core idea . However this piece does n't  really do that because a ) James " hides " important elements in the background b ) exposes something that is not the core focus of the movie . <p> When I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie about psychosis , greed and violence . I see a movie about cowboys burning cars . The foreground is so prominent that I have to look really hard to see there 's some additional elements in the background that are not just that background . And that is why I say the colour scheme is muddled . If the foreground was just a darker shade of that background color , or blue , or green , or any other colour that was not as contrasting , then the planes would make much more sense . <p> The first 2 give a good idea of what I mean yes , there 's high contrast , but the planes are easily distinguishable giving them proper definition . The third one does what James did but there is nothing in the 2nd and 3rd planes that is of any vital importance . <p> Perhaps my comment about the colour combination and the wrong ideas it conveys was poorly made . But I still think the combination is risky at best . <p> As for my choice of words regarding the simplicity , I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a technique used in cartoons and it should n't be used on a poster for such a movie . This is absolutely my biggest gripe about the poster . On the one hand you have a well defined silhouettes of the riders and the car , and on the other you have the simplistic smoke , clouds and mountains . There is a terrible , terrible discord of styles here . <p> @James I was hoping that by now you would know that I only criticize your stuff if there 's something that I really do n't  like and that I do n't  do it just for the sake of it . <p> Pawel , its fine that you do n't  like my poster and I was n't disputing you on the reasons why . I never would . However I still think the original point in my comment above was missed , man . I also noticed the tweet you wrote ( the #loadofcrap one ) which again was n't what I was trying to say . <p> Criticism should be about encouragement , man . That was my point . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet " , just offer a bit of insight as to why you think that way and perhaps a method of improvement . That 's it . Real simple . Positive outcome . <p> I truly do n't  understand why there 's a disagreement here , but to each their own . If you think it helps to leave the " I do n't  like it " comments on peoples art I guess that 's your prerogative . I would never tell you or anyone what to do , just wanted to offer a bit of insight through my experience . <p> This is a clean simple poster that is very well done James . I definitely see some Draplin inspiration in the typography . Which is not a bad thing that guy is an inspiration to us all . I shall be at WMCfest and look forward to meeting you in person .

For the final 9 days before the film hits theaters I would design a Tron style number counting down and release one each morning . I 've never done a project before where a daily release was involved so I thought it would be a great exercise , forcing me to spend an hour or 2 each day on personal work . I also worked it into the sequence of designing around the full color spectrum rather then keeping the series limited to the " Tron blue " . It was a real challenge to keep these images unique to one another yet maintaining a bit of diversity . <p> I started launching the designs at number 9 on the blog and Flickr , and did n't  really tell anyone what I was up to .

@@121792931 @10792931/ <h> Were you encouraged to create ? <p> I was visiting my friends Chris and Sameen last night and the topic of creativity in our younger years came up . This prompted a great discussion about how much we were encouraged as kids to nurture our creative side , whether that was through art classes , school projects , extracurricular activities or whatever we had access to . <p> Its very unfortunate that we live in a time where it seems art and music are the first areas that are cut when budgets come down , resulting in fewer creative access points for kids growing up . I graduated from high school in 1995 , so I 'm a little bit foggy on what exactly is happening in the creative world that encourages kids in elementary , junior high and high schools to keep drawing or painting . <p> Personally , in elementary school we had an almost weekly art class where we could draw or use the schools supplies to make things , which was all kinds of fun . In junior high I had access to a music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly an environment that endorsed creative exploration . Then once I reached high school , there was nothing .

I know the age ranges and geography of people who read the blog are quite varied , so I would like to pose you a question . Before you entered into any college or anything , were you encouraged to create when you were going through school ? Did you have classes available ? Were teachers understanding ? Did you have friends who were into art as well ? <h> 20 Comments <p> I 'm a bit weird I think with regards creative type stuff we had the usual arts/crafts/woodwork etc type classes but they did n't  really interest me , think mainly cause I was absolutely useless at them tending to be better/preferring the technical stuff like maths/IT . My creative side sort of started poking its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause I found out I could make pretty plasma effects in Pascal <p> Yeah , actually . Surprisingly so since I went to a public school system in a somewhat rural part of Ohio . <p> When I was in grade school there was just art class which everyone took . Those were fun though , they assignments were loose and you could just rock out . The teachers were pretty happy that you were just making stuff . <p> In high school we actually had a lot of classes . There were Art 1-4 , that were progressively more advanced survey classes , we also had silkscreen , drawing and ceramics classes ; at least two of each . We even had two whole art teachers . In those later classes they expected you to pick up on some actual technique , but the subject matter was still totally up to you . <p> I have always taken " art classes , " whether they be at summer camps , elementary school , etc . I was really encouraged by my parents to pursue art ( in my down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced art classes for students actually serious about sitting down and making something for an hour , and high school offered more of a variety of courses .

After a that point , it was up to me to decide if I wanted to pursue a creative lifestyle regardless of outside opinions . <p> I remember that in the fourth grade , we had an art period scheduled as a reward for good behaviour . But because it was so much work for the teacher to set up , plan and put away it was often taken away for the smallest infraction . <p> In high school I had one visual arts option .

Which is a shame I bet people love to see movies and buy CDs from their favorite artists .

Not much of an art program but art was embedded in many of the classes from cooking to coloring , drawing , music , and computer software . <p> In high school I took multiple photography courses , graphic design , studio art , drawing , printmaking , video production , an independent art study . There were at least 5 teachers who specialized in creativity at our school . In addition , all of my honors courses were incredibly creative and incorporated the option to use creative thinking and projects for presentations and group projects . <p> This of course continued into college advising , etc . <p> My public school system really fostered art .

Woodworking , drafting , band class , sewing class ( hated it ) , and of course art class . <p> My art class was great though , because there were specific levels for each grade , and the teachers would actually try and instruct you on things , as opposed to just letting you run wild .

Not sure how many times a week we had it , but I most definitely looked forward to it every time .

I think throughout Junior High I also discovered my ability to write neat and make " nice " things like posters and project covers <p> High school diminished most creativity . It was a tough time to " find myself , " as it is for most . We did have art class , but for some reason I did n't  take it . It was more about painting and things which never interested me ( I regret not taking it now ) . We had some electives available at my school though , so we took a variety of freshman electives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers , graphic arts , welding ) . Drafting , graphic arts , and computers were fun , especially the drawing part of drafting and the website making of computers . In grade 10 we had more choices and I took a whole semester of graphic arts ( screen printing and old film photography ) which I actually was n't so great at , other than taking some creative photos with an old camera . Then in grade 11 and 12 , graphic arts was no longer available , so I took a video editing class which replaced that ( graphic arts was a pre-req ) . I 'm not a video editor though , especially trying to learn a complex program ( final cut ) . We had fun , though especially making music videos with my friends . <p> And then of course , through out high school , I continued to impress people with my natural ability to have good typography on essays and project covers and posters . ; ) All through my school years actually , if there was a poster to be made for a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a group project , youd better believe I did most of it or had a strong opinion in it . <p> My parents were always pretty encouraging of my artistic side , as well . I 'd draw in my room for hours by myself ( who knows what ) , make posters for any lemonade stand or garage sale or anything , and whatever else . I also remember making posters and banners on a really old computer program we used to have and using up most of the ink cartridge to print them out . Good times = ) My mom ( and sister ) actually found the college/degree for me to go to because they figured I 'd probably be good at it . <p> WOW . I did not think this would be so long and I probably forgot to mention some things . I guess I had a huge variety of art experience growing up always good . <p> I was home schooled and my mom is an artist herself , so I was given quite a bit of encouragement throughout school in traditional art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me get into digital art . <p> We did n't  have any specific art classes in elementary school . It was just kind of mixed into various projects . I drew a lot , and got in trouble for it ( I was the bored gifted kid ) but the very same teachers told me that I should keep up drawing , just not while they were teaching . <p> Middle school had an art class and an art club which was ok . I left near the end of the year and went to a private K-12 school that had a lot of art classes . <p> Then I went to a private high school and had art classes each semester . Our teacher was hired right before my freshman year . Apparently the previously teacher was kind of crappy . My teacher instituted the first honors and AP classes . My class was her testbed . Art 1 &amp; 2 or music was the first year requirement . After the first year , additional classes were elective . I believe its the same in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in Chicago for 9 years , and art was the last thing that was encouraged . <p> I remember being in grades 1 through 8 and just filling notebook after notebook with all my favorite comic and cartoon characters . However , even though I had all As and Bs , my teachers felt that my doodling was " unproductive " and " disruptive " . Go figure . <p> We did n't  have any art classes at all at that school . And after awhile , I stopped drawing all my cartoons and characters because I kept getting reprimanded for it . <p> It was n't until half-way through my college career that I got back into it ! It was 3am in the 24hr center of my school , where I was studying for Adv . Physics and Differential Equations exams , that I had enough . I was n't happy . So , I closed my book , went home , and dropped all my courses the next day . I left the office and walked straight into the Art Department building . <p> I sometimes wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was so looked down upon when I was younger . <p> I just always loved drawing and it never occurred to me until later as a kid that other people did n't  do it as often . I was lucky to have a creative older sister and brother to look up to but not incredibly lucky at school . <p> The art program in my elementary/middle school was pretty average and the teachers were always happy with my work but I never felt very encouraged to that extra step . In High School the program was definitely sub-par , one of the three art teachers was really worth having class with and I only had him once in my four years there . No one understood what digital media and with my schools lack of funds there was no way I would get exposure to Adobe or 3D modeling until college so I just kept sketching . <p> Thankfully , sketching is suuuuuper important for industrial design so it would appear that my schools lack of being good at anything specific helped me polish one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back someday though and just catch a glimpse of some kids using illustrator or something in a computer lab with a teach who seemed competent on the topic . <p> I graduated high school in 2001 and the only thing artistic I did there was theater class . Art was an option but I went with theater instead . In middle school we had an art class but music was n't available because it was a small and poor catholic school . In elementary school we had art and music and it almost seems like we went to those classes everyday . <p> My mother is an elementary school art teacher currently and is in fear that she might be let go at any time . A few years ago they took away her art room and she had to put all her supplies in a closet in the music room . Then they gave her a spare room in the back of the school with no heat . Winters in Rhode Island are cold and here she is wearing a fur coat because she has to sit in a freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t-shirts because their own teachers do n't  think to have them put on their coats to go to art class . Its a mess and its sad . Kids need art . They need that creative release . <p> Thanks so much for taking the time to write such wonderful stories , everyone . Its really interesting to see so many different facilities you had access to growing up , and how that helped shape your creativity later on . <p> This post was conceived out of the notion that there is n't enough access to classes , clubs and so on for kids to really grab hold of , but its obvious from many of the comments here that I was wrong . I 'm really happy to see so many of you could learn about art at such a young age , and appreciate it later . <p> James , over the weekend I was skimming through some Ted Talks and came across this great talk by Sir Ken Robinson on Do schools kill creativity ? I am not sure if you have seen this talk before , but feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Ken Robinson 's talk is very interesting , informative , humorous and discusses the reasons why we need the arts in our educational system . <p> Hi James , great question . Here in Russia , back in 90s we did n't  have any art classes at school , and as for music , yes there was a music lessons , but all that we did there was signin a soviet communists songs of world war II or something . It was not so encouraging . But at the same time limitations give you a good push . Becuase when you do n't  have something you starting to make it by your own . Sorry for my english , I do n't  know how to say it .

I suppose the one I go back to is the first Indiana Jones . <p> As a kid in the 80s there was always a situation where my friends and I would play the good guys versus the bad guys . Spielberg brought that kind of childrens imagination to the big screen in the form of Indy fighting the Nazis . He was n't necessarily the perfect hero as he had his flaws but that 's what endeared him to us . And he was named after the dog . <p> Terminator 2 has , and likely will always be my favourite action movie of all time . Robert Patrick used to haunt my nightmares , chasing me with those chrome hooks of his . I still play it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some of the other gents in this comment post , my favourite action movie hands down is Terminator 2 .

Anyone else still cringe at the security guard eye poke scene ? <p> Great giveaway , the poster looks great . Its nearly impossible for me to select a " favorite " , but for a time I used to say Demolition Man was my favorite . I could watch that movie over and over again and never get sick of it . <p> Tough one ! Do n't  know if my judgement is based on me beeing 4 years old when it came , or if it actually is a good movie , but i 'm going with Demolition Man from 1993 with Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes ! <p> Terminator 2 is the greatest action movie of all time . Hands down . I saw it 7 times in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one set the bar so high nothing has even come close to touching it 20 years later . Long live T2 . <p> Awesome work ! Favourite action film has to be the Arnie classic Commando . Awful dialog full of terrible one liners with acting to match , farcical story , campest bad guy ever . oh and a backwards firing rocket launcher . <p> RoboCop for sure . Although the action scenes are great , the non-action elements make it a classic . Dark humor commentary on a bleak near future , which like any good science fiction , reveals itself to be tragically accurate over time . <p> Honorable mention to the Incredibles , which in my opinion is a top-shelf action film which just happens to be family-friendly animation . Dizzying , perfectly-paced fight scenes from start to finish . <p> The Thing was always a fave . I love flicks where you just know there is more to the story , but the writers/studios just do n't  give you what you want to know . Leave it to the imagination , who needs sequels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a poster for a sequel .. Great art , regardless . <p> I know its probably overused but I would have to say my favorite action movie would have to be Die Hard . I mean not only did bruce willis have awesome hair he also had a great sense of sarcasm . So good <p> such a tough one ! my favorite action movie changes about once a month Die Hard , Predator , Aliens , Total Recall . My current favorite is a film that has recently been changed in my eyes . Robocop . I have seen this on TV and DVD so many times , I have lost count . it was also one of the first 18 rated films i saw as a kid . This film took on new meaning after seeing it in the cinema recently on an original print . Extremely visceral , violent , and uber satirical all at the same time , I think I finally got it as an adult movie at the age of 33. a piece of genius . GO and see this in the cinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most of the 80s action flicks are a single blur for me ( " Commando2 , " Cobra " , all that nonsense ) , so I think it is actually T2 , if were thinking " straight " action films . But the absolute best for me is " Hot Fuzz " . <p> Its hard to say . So many great films Ive seen over the years . Saw tons of actions movies through my dad . Saw all the classics . Absolutely loved the Terminator movies because Arnold was a badass . Over the years , seen a couple that were awesome . But recently I saw The Raid Redemption and it really blew my mind ! ! Great action , good soundtrack to match the fast paced action ! ! So The Raid is my favorite action movie at the moment . <p> Wow , awesome artwork ! Though cliche I 'd probably have to go with Total Recall although I 'm not ashamed to admit I do love a bit of Steven Seagal . All about the classic quote from Under Siege 2 " NOBODY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to bring the realism back to the fold and say that my fav action movie is Saving Private Ryan . It does n't  have aliens or a Terminator or a man in a white vest with no shoes , but it has an opening half hour that shellshocks me overtime i watch it . <p> Most impacting was The Matrix but I was a lifelong fan of the entire James Bond series . There are amazing action sequences in Ip Man &amp; some of the korean revenge films like I Saw The Devil &amp; The Man From Nowhere . Best Arnold Film had to be True Lies . <p> Amazing work James ! I 'd have to say my favourite movie is between the Alien movies and Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Predator . Then there 's the Alfred Hitchcock movies ! Theres wayy too many movies to pick a fav haha . 
@@121792934 @10792934/ <p> Ive been a fan of Texan-based metal band The Sword for the better part of 5 years now , and I was surprised recently by the release of their new album , Warp Riders . <p> I picked up the album yesterday and , not only do the new tracks totally live up to The Swords talent but check out the album art and collateral . I really enjoyed the previous logo and artwork the guys put together for previous albums , but I was floored by this old school sci-fi direction . I thought the art looked strangely familiar , and as it turns out Dan McPharlin did all of the painting and design . You might remember his work from this post , or even this one . <p> My pal Skratch Bastid put on a hell of a spectacle at the Signalnoise art show on April 25th at Resistor Gallery in Toronto . Not only did he play a solid line-up of great tunes , but he started ripping up the tables near the end of the evening . Check out this video shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibe of Skratchs performance , and some really nice shots in there . <p> Big thanks to Aaron for sending this over , and always mad highfives to the Bastid for killin it . <p> If you follow me on Twitter , you might have seen me talking about the Finnish rock band Reckless Love over the past few months . The 4 boys in the band , Olli , Hessu , Jalle and Pepe hired me last year to create the bands visual identity including the logo , a couple of cd single covers and their official label debut album cover . <p> I 'm happy to announce that their debut is due to be released on February 24th , coincidentally my birthday ! Shown above is the final album cover design I created for the guys . <p> I mentioned this in a previous post about the band , but there is nothing better then working with someone who is excited about their project . That makes me excited , and inevitably makes the work better . Reckless Loves sound is inspired by hard rock and hair metal bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , the design hearkens back to that era being inspired by bands such as M+tley Cr++e and Van Halen : <p> Ive been listening to the final album for a little while now as I worked on the designs and I really ca n't wait for the release . Its construction is honest , and they capture perfectly the elements of fun from the era that inspires them , without any irony . Its no secret that I love modern updates of things past , so I 've enjoyed every second of working on this project . <p> Not too many music video knock me flat these days , but I had to write a post about Slow Poison by The Bravery . Beautifully crafted with lots of smooth effects and motion graphics barking back to the psychedelic scene from 2001 : A Space Odyssey . According to Buck , the production company behind the video : <p> " With a four week production schedule and a love song of sorts , we travelled back in time to the late seventies and joined a cult of psychonauts to make a video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel . " <p> Late seventies ? Psychonauts ? Panther love ? How could I not love all those things when they are packaged into a full spectrum space scene full of neon lines and lens flares ? Man , I would have loved to have been part of the team working on this one . <p> I 've mentioned a few times that there is nothing better then working with clients who are excited about what they do , because in turn they make me excited about what I 'm doing for them . Reckless Love is a prime example of this . <p> Reckless Love is a 4-piece hard rock/metal band from Finland inspired by the likes of M+tley Cr++e , Iron Maiden , Judas Priest , Halen . . . everything fun about metal in the 1980s . They just recently released their second single called Beautiful Bomb to follow-up their first , One More Time . Their agent attached this promo shot with the email when he initially contacted me , to which I blurted out " These guys look awesome ! Ill definitely work with them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started hammering through the logo style , which went through a few different versions before we settled on the final design . We both wanted something big , like Metallica or Judas Priest , but still captured the fun of the groups sound . I posted a few of the different iterations above to show how the process went , from the stripped down vectors to the final renders . As for the cover of the single they wanted something bright and colorful , which I was happy to hear : ) 80s metal goodness . <p> These are the kind of clients you want to work with , man . They are as excited about the music and design as I am , and were all coming from the same sources for inspiration in our different fields . Great bunch of guys , and more to come from Reckless Love , for sure . But in the meantime you can catch up with the guys on their Myspace . <p> So I 'm now back in Halifax after attending FITC Toronto . I attended FlashForward way back in 2000 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . I am extremely happy to have made it to Toronto for such a wicked time . I saw some exhilarating presentations by design industry leaders , met a tonne of great people and had a wonderful time at the multiple after parties . <p> It was announced that all of the FITC presentations were filmed and will soon be available on Vimeo , so I will be posting those once available . But for now , here is a little wrap-up of some of the hilights of the trip . <p> Top of the creative heap was seeing the mighty Joshua Davis do his presentation entitled Space . The talk was an excellent representation of his personality , work ethics , inspirations and exhibitions . On top of how inspirational his material was , he is a damn hilarious guy onstage . <p> Following his talk he had a wicked artshow entitled Outside the Lines at a wonderful gallery/art shop called Function 13 where me and Chris hustled over to immediately . After following Joshs work for 12 years , I finally got to meet the dude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Super solid guy , and I even bought one of his exhibition prints which Josh informed me was " the first print he created for the show .

Wicked guy , been a fan of Nicks work for a while now so it kicked ass to meet him for real . <p> Chris and I were about to enter the final after party when he spotted Shaun Hamontree of MK12 chilling outside . We had seen his presentation where he talked about his killer work on the Quantum of Solace opening credits , as well as an inspirational panel he sat on earlier that day . Chris earned his nickname of Ice Breaker once again and sparked up a conversation with him , which led to him and I nerding out about Tron , Star Trek , etc . <p> I sat in on some fantastic presentations , they spared no expense in getting some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fortunate to see these people present their material . The hilights were certainly Joshua Hirsch from Big Spaceship , Golan Levin and Zach Lieberman talking about their ground-breaking technology , Alex Cove discussing his beautiful algorithms , Brett Rampata from Adobe showcasing the hilarious new MTV Jackass application , and Ron Gervais from BTRY talking about his killer motion work . <p> And last but not least , we got to meet up with the awesome Allison McCarthy from Odopod with whom we hung out with for the duration of the trip . You rock , Allison ! <p> So this is a super condensed wrap-up of the trip to FITC Toronto as it seemed to go by in one giant blur . Had a wonderful time and cant wait to attend the conference again next year . Thanks for everything , Toronto ! <p> *Also big thanks to my pal Chris Toms who took all of the photos used in this post . <p> Here is a CD cover design I created for the 80s-style electro group Hyper Crush .

He forged a new way of thinking about the design and elements relating to film and forever changed the designers role in the industry . <p> However , Bass also worked as an identity designer creating some of the strongest and most important brands , most of which are still in use today . Listed above are : <p> I did n't  know Bass created these logos until a friend showed me the book Saul Bass and Associates . I was floored at how much stellar work Bass was responsible for , almost in disbelief that one person could do so much work . <p> I think that #8 would be more appropriately identified as Girl SCOUTS , not Girl Guides . I just checked the UK Guides site and they use the Trefoil logo . The Scouts use the logo shown above . ( BTW , I 'm a Brownie troop leader . ) <p> Great . these are super . My favourite logo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recylcling truck a couple of months ago . the company is Zoeller &gt;&gt;&gt; http : //www.zoeller.co.uk/ but i cant find any good images of their logo that are better than the one on their site <p> Fans of Saul Bass should check out the one motion picture he directed , Phase IV . Phase IV is about a mysterious event ( Phase I ) that makes the Earths ants super-intelligent -not giant ants , or radioactive ants , just regular tiny creatures . Phase II : the ants unite , Phase III they wipe out enemy species , Phase IV : -well , you have to see the film . Their hives are moody and precise geometric constructions , not the usual mud-holes , and the micro-photography of the ants at home is amazing . A really striking film , visually , as you might expect from Bass . He also designed the storyboards for Hitchcocks famous Psycho shower scene , although H gets credit for it . <p> Monte , thanks for your comment about the film " Phase IV " .

Not entirely true . Saul Bass , at best , tweaked the Exxon logo . It is not a revision . I looked up the original logo in Loewy 's monograph , Industrial Design . Saul Bass removed the thick blue rule under the logotype . Whatever you want to call it , tweak or revision , his changes do not rise to the level of inspiration . The inspiration belongs entirely to Raymond Loewy . To be idiotically consistent , why not feature the revision of the AT&amp;T logo by FutureBrand ? Hopefully , that revision did n't inspire you . <p> As much as I am an admirer of Saul Bass visual identity work I feel it is misleading to include EXXON in this group .

At worst his comments have been taken out of context and misunderstood . At best , its Hitchcocks honesty that would be more in question in this matter . Bass was indeed responsible for creating that incredible shower scene , just not as the on-the-spot director . <p> In fact , the cast and/or crew of Psycho DO NOT dispute the assertion that Bass created and designed the story-board for the shower scene in Psycho . They could n't anyway because the story board designed by Bass is now in the public domain and it has been confirmed in recent research that the scene was designed in its entirety by Saul Bass ( as well as another murder scene in the movie see Bill Krohns " Hitchcock at Work " , Phaidon Press , 2003 ) <p> The question that the cast and crew were asked was if Saul Bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  . Bass never said he did . Basss assertion was that he PARTICIPATED in the direction . And indeed he did participate in the direction , very much so , as you 'll see if you look at the story boards . But Basss participation in the direction was at the story-board stage , his directions were on paper . Hitchcock simply put them on film . People got their knickers in a knot without stopping to think about what 's involved in directing and how many ways there are to participate in directing without actually being on set telling everyone what to do . <p> When Hitchcock directed this scene he followed the storyboards created by Bass so slavishly that the actors are renowned for having complained about how specific and regimented Hitchcock was in sticking to the exact details of " his " story-board . For the most part the actors were not told the story-boards were created and devised by someone else . <p> And this is why Bass is credited in the films titles ( albeit grudgingly as being for " Pictorial graphics " as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the scene is so very reminiscent of Basss style . IMO He should have been given more credit for his work on this scene but Bass did n't  seem to mind too much . <p> So many victims here . The disregard for the for thoughtful design and its history is staggering : Not only did some group of big-business geniuses scrap the name of the inventor of the telephone : BELL , in favor of the made up soulless moniker VERIZON , they also threw out the simple and iconic logo . All in the name of being " contemporary " no doubt . The United logo is the most recent tragedy . Continental and United have apparently come to some sort of middle-ground and combined the forgettable Continental spinning globe logo with the updated and equally forgettable UNITED AIRLINES typography:http : //www.united.com/ <p> These two cases are a sad commentary of the state of graphic designed in corporate America .

Naomi Atkinson , owner and operator of Whosit &amp; Whatsit over in Newcastle Upon Tyne in the UK , has asked to host the very first live Signalnoise workshop titled Photoshop vs . Illustrator . All of my work has equal parts vector and raster incorporated into the final product , and I 'll be explaining my full process in this 1-day mighty workshop . <p> Without further ado , let 's get straight to the details for this rad event : <p> James White from the Signalnoise Studio will take the class on a journey through his creative process. - Beginning with- sketchbook- thumbnails , to a refined drawing , we will discuss the ins and outs of conceptualising a design for our pop-culture art piece .

This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanche heads up you big brands .

I 'm not talking about making buttloads of money or landing some big agency gigs , but moreso personal development and building a more solid brand foundation . Its normal for me to feel like I 'm floundering around trying to find direction , but looking back at this year I can see a more focused vision despite starting off on the wrong foot . <p> So here we go a look at 2013 and some of the highlights the year brought . <p> February 2013 : - Vintage console illustrations After a year of trying to design movie posters , I decided to give up on the dream out of sheer frustration . This time of weird upheaval led to me creating a bunch of original illustrations of vintage game consoles , in a style that was very much new to me . I figured out a process and started machine-gunning out illustrations in an attempt to re-invent Signalnoise which ended up dictating the rest of my year and caught the attention of new clients . A weird time with a wonderful outcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spearheaded by the greatest comic shop on earth , Strange Adventures , we inked a deal with IDW Publishing where I created 4 original comic book covers for The Rocketeer : Hollywood Horror . Truly a dream job , IDW even catered to my silly whims and printed the illustrations with spot gold foil on the helmets . Had loads of fun doing these . <p> April 2013 : - Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon The best client project I ever worked on . Dean Evans , my 80s brother , brought me onto the project and together we developed the logo and " box art " that would represent Far Cry 3 : Blood Dragon online . A teaser was launched on April Fools Day which caused quite the " Is it real ? " fiasco online , instantly capturing an audience . Signalnoise was swept up in the excitement as my art flew all over the world . Way too much fun on this one . <p> May 2013 : - Hangin with Kurt Russell During my trip to Los Angeles to speak at Adobe MAX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party with his photographer friend Greg Gorman . One of the guests was none other than Kurt Russell . I got to hang out with , talk some movies and things with him and give him my poster of THE THING . Heck of a nice guy too . Certainly a high point of 2013 . <p> May 2013 : - The Great Discontent interview I was honoured when my favourite design interview site got a hold of me , The Great Discontent . I ( virtually ) sat down with Ryan and Tina where we got to the bottom of many topics revolving around our industry . Since I wanted to give them some nice professional photos , my friend and wicked talented photographer Krista Comeau came to the rescue . She handsomed me up good . <p> June 2013 : - Creative Control cosmic poster A lovely opportunity spear-headed by Mystery Box was to create a unique Signalnoise poster design for Opening Doors . I decided to reach back to a style I was doing 5 years ago and design something retro-cosmic . Everyone was onboard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even got me to design the Creative Control logo . <p> July 2013 : - Patch designs for Opera Browser I had the wonderful opportunity to work with the great people at Opera Browser in support of their Made to Discover campaign . Opera needed some patch designs to sprinkle throughout their push , heavy embroidery influence and taking cues from Scout badges I had as a kid . So much fun on this one , and a wonderful end product by Opera . <p> July 2013 : - UziCopter : The Signalnoise Tumblr I decided to create a Signalnoise moodboard for my own use , to gather rad inspiration and stuff as reference for future projects . Upon research , the best platform to do that is Tumblr so I set up UziCopter : The Signalnoise Tumblr . It grew at a rapid pace , was featured on several high profile blogs and is currently supporting a following of 2196 . An unexpected surprise , and a very useful resource for all things awesome . <p> July 2013 : - WarGames poster for Skuzzles A big highlight of 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WarGames . This was a big deal since I had basically given up on doing movie posters after a year-long attempt to break into the poster community proved unsuccessful in 2012 . I had a wonderful time building this poster for my pals at Skuzzles . <p> July 2013 : - Mission patch logos for NFB Space School Its no secret that I enjoy all things to do with space exploration , so I was thrilled when I got a call from the National Film Board of Canada to design mission patch style logos for their launch of the NFB Space School . I designed the official logo for the project as well as all the patches representing the sections . Honoured to have been a part of a project that teaches kids about space and space exploration . <p> July 2013 : - Superman poster After getting asked to contribute to the SUPER Art Show in Australia , I was lucky enough to lay claim on the Man of Steel the most iconic superhero of our time . Exploring a more geometric , painterly style I developed a poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 : - Heavy Metal Photoshop t-shirt When Adobe asked me to design a cool Photoshop shirt for them to give away at the San Diego Comic Convention , I immediately blurted out " I 'm gon na make you a heavy metal shirt ! " . To my surprise they were onboard , and I developed them this hilarious design . Badass . I even put all the Photoshop version release dates on the back of the shirt just like tour dates . So much fun . <p> August 2013:The StarKade Series - While building the deck on the back of my house during the summer I decided I wanted to design some fun little illustrations depicting WWE wrestlers from my youth . What started as a little project quickly blossomed into an independent print series . I released 4 sets of prints in late 2013 , all of which have sold out . 2014 is looking very bright for the StarKade series as I 'm being approached by galleries and art shows . Stay Tuned ! <p> September 2013 Panthers and Designers : Its not too often you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearded man-mountain is Carolina Panther Ryan Kalil , and that baseball-capped fella is designer extraordinaire Matt Stevens . I was in town speaking at Blend Conference and Ryan was nice enough to sit down with Matt and I to jaw about some football , design , film and other fun projects . We had a killer time , so much so that Ryan turned me into a Panthers fan for life . Got ta support your buddies ! <p> November 2013 : - Creative Spark , Lynda documentary I 'm still stunned that this happened . The mighty Lynda sent a film crew up to Dartmouth to shoot a documentary on me and my art right here in my studio . The largest source of online design education launched the doc and it was quickly selected as a Staff Pick on Vimeo . Humbled and honoured but yeah , still in shock . <p> November 2013 : - Adobe InDesign interview Another honour of 2013 was being interviewed and featured in Adobe Inspire magazine . We got to the bottom of a lot of issues , and they designed the iPad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I created for them . Whoa . Being interviewed by the very people who create the software I use every day blew my mind . Thank-you Adobe ! <p> All year : - Signalnoise 2013 World Tour- One of the biggest highlights for Signalnoise this year was the amount of traveling I did . There were 20 live dates booked across Canada , the United States , Europe and even the Philippines . Think I spent more time in hotel rooms than I did at home . Once again , a giant thanks to everyone who invited me to their events , everyone who came out to see me speak , and a shout to all those fellow presenters I had the pleasure of meeting in 2013 . <p> One of the frequent questions I get asked is " Where do you get inspiration from ? " . That 's a pretty daunting inquiry , far too big to answer in a few minutes as there 's no one specific place an artist goes to every single time . Books , movies , comics , cartoons , music all over the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting images in an attempt to build a big Signalnoise moodboard . A resource that would always be available to me when I wanted cool stuff to look at , and would also keep me on the hunt for new rad stuff I wanted to save . I figured Tumblr was a great way of doing this . So here we go , The Signalnoise Tumblr . <p> Flipping through that thing you should get a very heavy dose of the Signalnoise vibe . Every image I save on that thing is there for a very specific reason , whether its cool type , a wicked lighting effect or wild colours . I do n't  save just anything related to the 80s , only the stuff that nails it . I 'll continue to keep this Tumblr heavily curated to keep the mood focused . <p> In a super-taxing effort to not completely geek-out , last night I had the pleasure of hanging out in Hollywood with Kurt Russell and a bunch of other amazing people . We all had dinner , got to try his new wine , hear some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE THING poster I designed . Said he loved it . <p> If you know me at all , you 'll also know that I do n't  discuss my Help Japan poster very often . Of all my posters and designs it was the one that reached the furthest , was seen by the widest audience , and- galvanized- charitable funds far above my expectation . This all happened 2 years ago and its taken me this long to approach the subject- publicly , and personally . <p> I create lots of stuff , the size of my portfolio is proof of that . So when something happens where I think my creative efforts may help , I 'll give it a shot . That 's what happened on the morning of March 11 , 2011 when news reached me about what happened in Japan . I made something to raise money , much the same as the ladies in the seniors home who held a bake sale around the corner from my house . I 'd sell my poster via my online store and donate the proceeds to the Canadian Red Cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got started . <p> Within an hour my poster went viral . <p> I started getting- phone calls- from the- New York Times- and other big publications. - The response was intimidatingly positive as I started setting up the print run , ordering shipping supplies and enlisting friends to help me with all the work . A LOT of work , hundreds of tubes to be packed , processed and shipped but it was definitely worth it given the cause . I could n't believe it . <p> Then the unexpected happened . Even if you have the best intentions possible , sometimes things can come out of left field to give you a knock . When a story , video , or piece of art goes viral it breaches the bubble of personal audience and goes out to the general online public , which exposes you to not only the positive , but to the negative . Its no secret that the negative screams louder than the positive , especially with the anonymity of the internet . This was a harsh reality hit me head-on . <p> Each morning during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was- receiving- emails and blog comments from those who took it upon themselves to tell me I was doing something horrible . The remarks were almost- frightening , ranging from harsh design critiques , cultural differences and personal attacks on my character . They 're all still live here and here , if you need some context . For a time I was even scared of answering my own phone . For a freelancer working alone out of a small home office , this wasnt easy to deal with in the least . But I kept forcing the bigger picture into my head : the good cause . <p> This is when Fast Company decided to rear its head . In this article entitled Is This Poster to Aid Japan 's Tsunami Victims a Crime Against Design ? , John Pavlus took it upon himself to voice his opinion about my- charitable- endeavour . It should be noted right away that neither Fast Company , nor John himself , contacted me for a statement prior to posting the article on their very well-travelled website . A pretty key mis-step in- journalism- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic at hand . Unknown to anyone but myself ( and close friends ) , this article alone caused the most damage to me and my campaign , igniting not only a new round of harsh emails and comments but this time , from within the design community . A field I love and respect . This alone caused me to almost shut down the campaign . <p> Despite all of this , the campaign was seen through and raised around $20,000 for the Canadian Red Cross as I shipped posters out of my basement . I said earlier , far and above the original little idea . <p> So , why am I writing this 2 years later ? Its not out of disagreement with nay-sayers and its certainly not an attempt to garner sympathy or encouragement ( seriously , please withhold comments of that nature , guys ) . Ive been running this blog for 5 years and Ive always felt a certain responsibility to my audience ( specifically designers ) to discuss the industry through experience , as transparently as possible . We all have ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My reasons are 2-fold <p> First , be careful . If your main goal is for something to " go viral " in whatever form , be careful . Your work will be reaching a much wider audience and in some cases people wont think twice about voicing harsh opinion several times over to a complete stranger . Growing a thick skin only comes through experience . Even though you have the best intentions , your truth might get contorted and thrown under the bus . So be careful . <p> And second , stick it out . If you are doing something with nothing but the best intentions do NOT let those people stop you , whether they are anonymous critics or writers on respected websites . If you 're doing what you believe in , and you 're doing it for others do n't  let an elusive negative force stop you , even if it sticks with you well after the fact . <p> 2 years later , I 'm thinking hard on all this stuff and despite the harsh language directed toward me , my design and my campaign , I would n't have done it any differently .

Last week I had my first guest on the show to talk some art and illustration , my good pal Mike Holmes trekked over to hang out . Mike is a talented illustrator who has several published graphic novels : Shenanigans ( Oni ) , This American Drive ( Invisible ) , This is a Souvenir ( Image ) , and the released-in-April True Story ( Invisible ) . He has also done gig posters for famed funnymen Paul F.

It was a great time . So have a watch , and be sure to check out Mikes Flickr , Tumblr and say hello to him on Twitter . <p> This poster was an odyssey within itself . I immersed myself in 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film twice along with all the making of footage and documentaries , researching concept art and posters online , and doing a bunch of sketching . Even once I had a concept on the go , it changed a few times as I started building my elements . I wanted the poster to have a subtle touch , hit the theme of the film , yet still have a Signalnoise flavor . It was daunting to say the least . Here are a few previous versions and sketches . <p> One of my favorite design elements of 2001 are the planet edges with a rising sun , so I included a lot of arches and horizons in this one to mimic that concept . Played with a lot of symmetry as well , echoing the film . I wanted to shy away from any wild rainbow effects or showcasing HAL , those ideas seemed a bit too obvious . <p> All in all , a super fun design to work on . Going to get some posters made of this one soon . <p> On February 21st one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zelda celebrated its 25th birthday . 25 years since Link took up his very first sword to do battle with the evil forces of Gannon . I remember borrowing a friends Zelda game way back in the NES days , staying up way too late playing that thing as I 'm sure so many of you had as well . Little did I know at the time that 25 years later Link would still be at the top of the franchise heap . <p> In celebration of 25 the stunning artwork seen above appeared online , created by Japanese artist ag+ . I wish I could find a more direct link to their work but I got lost in the sea of Japanese interwebs . Want to have your face melted ? Check out the full-res version . Absolutely beautiful . <p> And now let 's bring it all the way back to the late 80s with this hilariously silly and infinitely charming television commercial for the original , the best , The Legend of Zelda .

You wo n't want to miss this one . <p> Here is a bunch of images plucked from the growing library over at Vintage Future , a great link that my pal Shelby White fired over to me . A lot of the work I do is based on this strange pocket of researching the pasts interpretation of the future . Ever since we could dream we 've been trying to design how we think the future may look , but inevitably we draw upon the now so the designs are rooted in the time they were created . Strange paradox . <p> I just love this stuff . The optimistic outlook , the bits of past technology , the desaturated color palette , the little rips and wrinkles . It all comes together in a perfect representation of what kids back in the 60s were looking at in magazines while dreaming of the future . Great stuff . <p> Here is something that started as a personal project , kind of . A couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tweets and doing some surfing when my favorite metal act , The Sword posted a tweet in search of an artist . That was essentially as specific as it was so , needless to say I had a message with portfolio link back to them in seconds . <p> When approaching a new client , or more specifically another group of artists , I always find it awkward simply sending my portfolio as I know the work I do for them will be much more specific . That was the case with The Sword as nothing in my portfolio fit the theme of sci-fi metal , at least not as much as I 'd like . So I decided to go that extra step and create a " test " poster to show something in the theme of the band . Heck , I 've been listening to these guys for 6 years or something , this is a long time coming . <p> Well , the test poster took on a life of its own and I pushed the design through to the finish . Heavily influenced by the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a very painterly and textured feel and something that call backs to sci-fi novel covers from the 70s with a bit of Heavy Metal magazine in there . A couple of 80s cartoon references were thrown into the mix as well , Lion-Os sword from Thundercats was the basis of the style and I wanted the landscape to look like Eternia from Masters of the Universe . All of this influence makes sense if you 've listened to The Swords newest album , Warp Riders . <p> The concept came together rather quickly , and I moved from the sketchbook to Illustrator to Photoshop within a day . I started just last Thursday . After that it was a matter of adding all the textures , shading and atmosphere you see in the final . The poster has already been sent and seen by the guys and got some very positive feedback . Kind of a dream job . Rock n roll ! <p> The overall concept behind this poster : What being was wielding that sword ? ! <p> Ill hopefully be sending this poster to proof this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the permission of the boys since it sports their logo of course . <p> For those who missed watching SNBC 41 last Thursday , here is the recorded version . There was n't a specific topic this week , just a general art and design QA session as I talked with the viewers . Always a great time and a great turnout . <p> This week we discussed things like watermarking images , the benefits of having a home workspace , the upcoming Signalnoise Store launch , canvas prints , how to deal with clients who do n't  know what they want , the value of internships , the iPhone games I play , the people speaking at OFFF Barcelona , curing creative blocks , my Orbinauts toy designs etc .
