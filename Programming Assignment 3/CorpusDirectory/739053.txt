" This concept was popularized in the book , " Seven Habits of Highly Successful People , " from Stephen R. Covey . Every time we do something positive ( compliment , help with training , listen intently , respond quickly , etc. ) we make a positive deposit in the relationships emotional bank account. - Every time we do something negative ( criticize , ignore , are curt , make demands , etc. ) we make a withdraw .

@@121328602 @10328602/ <h> Dress For Success <p> In the opening paragraph of his book , Dress For Success , by John T. Molloy , he states , <p> " FACT : Most American men dress for failure . They do so because they make one or more of four suicidal mistakes : They let their wives or girlfriends choose their clothing . They let their favorite sales clerks choose their clothing . They let designers and " fashion consultants " choose their clothing . Or they let their backgrounds choose their clothing . " <h> Let Research Choose Your Clothing <p> Mr. Molloy goes on to suggest that , for success in business , men and women should let research choose their clothing . After over 15,000 interviews John points out several patterns that lead toward successful dressing . He points out the obvious that it is not fair or just or even moral for a mans success or failure to depend , to a large extent , on how he dresses , but that is very much the way money-oriented sectors of our culture work . We may not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must adhere to it . <p> As a field rep , you may work or have to present to very conservative companies ( ie. , Sony , IBM , Lotus , HP , Mitsubishi , Canon , Apple , etc . ) . Many of these companies have strong corporate dress codes and styles that , whether they are conveyed to us or not , are expected of all field repswhether you work for that company or not . It is absolutely essential that field reps match the highest dress standards of the strictest of these companies to achieve acceptance and succeed . We do not want our resellers to avoid taking us to their best accounts because of " unbusiness-like " appearance . <p> Our " company flag " ( as demonstrated by our dress code ) might professedly show our image as that of strong , conservative , professionals . Our dress , at least outwardly , demonstrates our ability to comply to our companies desires and needs to have a clean , conservative , honest and moral ( that 's right , moral ) perception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding its renown code of dress for " white shirts only , " based its decision on research that clearly showed executives with white shirts as having " greater moral strengths " than that attributed to men wearing the " other colors . " <p> Considering the importance associated with our corporate image , what then is considered proper and " effective " dress ? <h> The Look That Kills <p> When working on a national launch and deciding on the type of resellers to visit it is often easier to work in reverse and point out the type of accounts not to see , thus allowing the reps some discretion with the resellers in their area . It might be easier to do likewise in deciding the type of dress for us to follow . There are some obviously major no , nos : <p> No " flaming " attire . This unequivocally refers to the " flammable " polyester clothes ( beware of sitting beside a smoker with polyester clothesif their clothes catch fire ( and they do burn well ) the polyester flame is hot and spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has worn off , how can you tell if the shirt or pants you wear is polyester ?

These are the type of pants that are obviously worn by the recent convert expecting all the world to burn and hence is preparing for another great flood . If the pants you wear do n't  cover your socks , then either have them altered to fit or cut them shorter and use them for the next company picnicat the pool . <p> Beware of shoes that float .

We might not always take such obvious sides , especially if we discuss some more relative clothing stylesperhaps a style we may be wearing right now while reading this section . Yet it is the nit-picky clothing issues that may be our current concern . <p> If you were hired as a field rep then it is obvious that your clothing was not so inappropriate as to keep you out the dooreven though it may have been some other hiring asset that was of significant offsetting redeeming value . New reps , however , will be scrutinized even more carefully as the company develop its own style and request adherence . <h> The Bottom Line Means Business <p> Here , without debating the issue , based on what worksnot on what we may each " personally " prefer , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was originally created for a rep firm with multiple conservative vendorsit may or may not apply in your case ) : <h> For Women <p> For women the standard is easier : <p> Well managed hair and a manageable amount of well applied make upif desired ( avoid the " Tammy Baker " look ) . <p> Conservative , modest dress or skirt and blouse . Slacks and a blouse may be appropriate for trade show eventsno regular or designer jeans or the like . <p> Well kept shoes and accessories . <p> Follow additional suggestions from your local manager . <h> For Men <p> As a standard , always lean toward the finished , classic , high quality , traditional clothing presenting an image that is self-assured , never self-conscious . Be sure to avoid the trendy lookit is not for business . Also , pay special attention to the majority of your accounts business dress : if they do n't  wear ityou shouldnt either ( they do n't  always tell us their dress standards but they do show it ) . <p> In addition , you should adhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Tailored Wardrobe for Men " ( a Nordstrom publication ) . - We have found that this manual succinctly describes the appropriate style , fit , material , accessories and options that appear appropriate for our business needs . Pay particular attention to the fit and style sectionsit is of no avail to have quality , conservative clothing that fits sloppy or is later neglected . This publication should be available through the company headquarters or direct from your local Nordstrom department store . <p> You will be expected to gear up your wardrobe to match the exclusive recommendations suggested in this publication as a company standard and avoid any type of dress that would not match the guidelines it suggest . To avoid confusion , some of the guidelines and tips are included below : <p> Suits : All reps should have a full suit for special events . It is not always necessary to wear it to traditional trainings yet highly recommended . Dark " traditional " suits tend to lend more credibility to younger men . They should be the best quality you can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season ) , be made of 100% wool or a quality wool blend . Double breasted suits may be appropriate but traditional soft shoulder styles , with a single vent ( double for blazer ) , are more practical and appropriate ( avoid the " cowboy " styles or the " young persons " ( no vent ) style ) . Chuck the old " Swedish Knit " suit as soon as possibleit is a long-wearing utility suit , not a business suit . <p> Fit : Fit is " all important " when purchasing a suit . Usually you must insist on a double fitting for proper tailoring ( the first fitting to get the proper dimensions , and the second fitting to fine tune the linesget rid of bulges , etc . ) . At the price of suits , an additional $15-$35 refitting cost to the store is not too much to ask . <p> Shirts : Shirts should not have different colored collars , ALWAYS have long sleeve and should never be rolled up . Mr. Molloy , in his aforementioned book , further states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this book at all seriously , note well the following : You will never , ever , as long as you live , wear a short sleeve shirt for any business purpose " His book decisively describes why . You may want to get a copy for further reference . <p> Material : All shirts should be of 100% cotton or a high blend and should be clean , meticulously pressed and starched ! Nothing beats the look of a well fitting , well starched shirt ! Cotton is the look we want but it wrinkles like heckunless you select " broadcloth " or " Queens Oxford " which holds up better throughout the day without excessive wrinkling . <p> Care : It is highly recommended that you have your cotton shirts professionally washed ( ask for washeddry cleaning your shirt is not necessary , nor preferableit dries out the natural fiber ) and starchedmost professionals have this donelight starch will still look great , is cooler , and your shirt cuffs last longer . You can wash and press your own shirts if you want but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or about $4-$5 a week ) you can avoid the required 15 minutes apiece over the ironing board ! <p> Ties : Silk is the preferred fabric and the pattern should be conservative ( no flying toasters , etc . ) . Learn to tie an appropriate knot ( avoid the " puggies " ) and , for business purposes , avoid loosening your top buttonit usually shows that you did n't  buy the proper sized shirt . <p> Pocket Squares ( Handkerchiefs ) : Pocket squares may help you achieve that " finished look " and in our business are almost always appropriate . Avoid buying a prepackaged , matching tie/square setit looks too pat and suggest that you cant coordinate your own dress . <p> Belts : Exotic buckles should be worn with Levisnot business attire . Pick a conservative leather , well-fitting belt . The color should usually match your shoes . Suspenders are fine if the pants can support them . <p> Shoes : One of the first thing a person sees when sizing up another person is his shoes . Tasteful and well-cared-for footwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Lace ups are the most formal yet leather penny loafers are also fine . The word with shoes is clean and polishedthis should be a requirement . A good pair of shoes trees helps your shoes maintain that new look and pulls them back into shape after a long day . <p> Jewelry : Keep jewelry to a minimum . Classic gold watches , a wedding ring , and collar bars are acceptable business wear . Tie tacks are not recommended as most silk neck wear drapes well . Gold wrist chains , neck chains , and ear rings are often associated with immaturity and femininitythey should never be worn for any business function . <p> " Business " Casual Dress : when " business " events ( not sporting events ) call for casual dress it does not mean " home " dress ( ie. , faded blue jeans , wrinkled T-shirts , grubby shoes , etc . ) .

Overcoming objections is one of the most essential things a field rep can learn . One of the major skills a field rep needs to know in fielding objections is that a customer does n't  always give the real reason they are not buying .

They might not realize this is the reason for their objection but a good field rep does realize it . <h> Treat Objections As Questions <p> You should learn to treat objections as if the customer was saying , " I am not sold with the facts and information you have thus far presented .

@@121328618 @10328618/ <h> Group Presentations <p> Since field reps are often required to give presentations to groups of sales reps , at large user groups , at shows ( such as Comdex or Softeach ) or to a vendors board of directors , then it is imperative that field reps become proficient at presenting to groups . If your- - subject material includes the current tour then your actual presentation should be fairly polished . If , - - however , you are presenting new material you will need to organize it effectivelypreferably in the seven step " persuasive format " that was discussed earlier . Regardless of whether your material is familiar or new , you will need to be aware of the guidelines for an effective presentation to groups . Following are some tips : <p> We have all been in a meeting or classroom that was physically uncomfortable . Either the temperature was too high , or low , the seats were not properly positioned , or there were too many outside distractions . We need to ensure that none of these problems exist , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation . <p> Adjust the temperature . For group presentations you should arrive in plenty of time to find a janitor , if necessary , to set the temperature properly . In a formal setting , where suits may be worn , remember to drop the temperature at least 10 degrees lower than normal . Cooler rooms are generally more conducive to an enthusiastic response . Be aware that the room temperature may change drastically in the later afternoon and , if the room is prone to heat up , plan your meeting accordingly . <p> Take charge of seating . If the room has fixed seating you 'll have to make due but if the chairs are movable then take the initiative and rearrange them to suit your purpose . Chairs should face away from the door and windows if possible , to minimize distractions . Avoid having the sun in anyones eyes or having glare interfere with their ability to see any visual materials . Before the meeting , sit in different chairs to make sure they are properly positioned . Its also important to understand that different meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrangements <h> Lecture or Audiovisual Seating <p> For a lecture or audiovisual presentation , everyone in the audience must be able to see the speaker or screen ( like Figure 2not like Figure 1 ) . Do n't  put unnecessary space between the speaker and audience by creating a middle aisle . If there must be an aisle , put it off center so as much as possible of the center area can be used for seating . When using projectors or video machines , make sure that people are not seated where the machine will interfere with their view ( Figure 3 ) . As a rule of thumb , when showing a movie or any overhead presentation , do not place chairs within a distance one half the height of the screen . <h> Panel-Discussion Seating <p> Remember that the panel needs to be in full view of everyone in the audience . If there is to be panel-audience interaction , the arrangement in Figure 5 is more appropriate than that in Figure 4 ( the table is nice but not absolutely necessary and may even ostracize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in a circle , ( Figure 6 ) you invite eye contact and interaction among them . This may be exactly what you want for a discussion . However , if group control is important then you might try a more " box like " arrangement . <h> Overcrowding <p> Remember to stager the seats if necessary to avoid blocking anyones view . <h> Audience Control <p> A simple guideline about control is , if you want rigid control use rigid straight lights or " V " type angles . If you want to encourage free discussion then use curves and open circles . <h> Visual Aids Create Impact <p> It has been estimate that more than 75 percent of the information we take in during the day or in any given situation comes in through our eyes . The film , " Visual Aids " ( 1 ) states that we learn the most from seeing . <p> Examining the data from a different viewpoint , the Industrial Audio Visual Association reports(2) : <p> It may have been only recently that we have received scientific and statistical confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a long time . There is an ancient Chinese proverb that reads : " I hear and I forget . I see and I remember . I do and I understand . " <p> Another study by R. Benschofter(3) , reports the influence of using sound and sight , separately or combined , as a teaching tool : <p> Taking into account that the average speaker talks at 125 to 130 words per minute and that our brains can think four or five times that fast allows us to understand why listeners get bored and distracted . Now add to this the fact that our language can be up to 60 percent redundant , and you have a clearer picture as to why people tune out when presentations are totally verbal in content . <p> When speakers use visual aids , they " entertain " or focus the visual attention of the listeners on material related to the presentation . Thus , the speakers have more influence over the total information processing of the listeners . <p> The old saying , " Use a visual aid when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in light of the evidence to a saying such as , " Use visual aids whenever you want to enhance what you are saying . " <h> Types of Visual Aids <p> There are several types of visual aids . Some of these include white boards , chalk boards , flip charts , slides , overhead projectors , video tape , film , and of course , computer graphics . <h> Boards <p> Stand to the side of a board as you write or display your materials . Use key words only . Also , try to talk while you are writing . Not saying anything while you manipulate parts of a board can create an awkward silence that can ruin the pacing of your presentation . <h> Flip Chart <p> Whenever using a hand held flip chart try to flip the pages up toward your face . Also , when you close it , close up toward your faceagain , to draw the viewer toward your face . <h> Overhead Projector <p> Tilting the overhead screen or placing it toward the corner of the room reduces the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers . Be sure to rehearse before using an overhead to ensure your material is well organized and the unit is properly focused and centered . <h> Videotape and Film <p> Before starting , remind your viewers of the length of the video so they wont be looking at their watches wondering if they 've walked into a three hour version of " Ghandi . " You should also give a preview to warm the audience up . Remember , volume usually needs to be adjusted differently for a filled room versus and empty onekeep this in mind and do n't  hesitate to make initial adjustments on the fly if absolutely necessary . <p> One common mistake a field rep might make is to talk during the showing . As the presenter , you may have already seen the show a hundred times but you should behave as though it were your first time and keep quiet . If you must talk , leave the room . <h> Graphics <p> Graphics should be well-spaced and easy to read . The size of the lettering on visuals needs to be tested prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " readability chart " for sizing of letters . <h> Points To Remember <p> Try not to read from your slides , charts , or displays . This wastes time and bores your audience . Rather , coordinate your audiovisuals with your speech so that they pictorially illustrate what you are saying . <p> Do n't  leave up your displays when you are not referring to them . Theyll only be distractions . <p> Pass out your handouts after you 've finished so your audience wont be reading and shuffling them during your speech . <h> Caution <p> Word of Caution : The visual is an aid . It should never become more important than the speaker it is aiding . <h> Questions <p> What are two examples of creating the proper environment ? <p> The figure to the left is an example of what type of seating ? <p> What is a simple seating guideline to maintain audience control ? <p> What percentage of the information we take in comes from sight ? <p> The last thing we want is to have a vendor call back our stores and quiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the percentage of retention three days later if the dealer was both told and shown ? <p> Before showing a video or film you should always tell the audience . <p> If your audience is up to 50 feet away then how big should be your lettering ?

@@121328655 @10328655/ <h> Field Coaching The Coaching &amp; Model Call <p> Field training is the fastest way to improve performancebar none. - Field training is divided into two parts , 1 ) the " Coaching Call " and- 2 ) the " Model Call . " The purpose of the coaching call is to ensure that a ) the rep is covering the product/service selling points , b ) the demo is well presented , c ) the rep has learned his product/services , and d ) he is following all the " Steps of the Sale , " including the set-up , the close , overcoming objections , trial close questions , the close question , etc . <p> The key to an appropriate coaching call is to first ensure your coach has refined his skills , or at least knows what good performance should be even if they have n't quite got it down perfect yet . The worlds best swimming coach does n't  have to be the worlds best swimmer , if he at least knows what makes a good swimmer . We must learn how to identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reread it as needed ) before seeking any field training . <p> In addition , the trainer should be better than the trainee . If you do n't  know your material , or your ratios are lower than the person you are supposed to help , then find a team member that can act as a mentor . Better yet , follow the steps to improve your own skills , or you 'll mess up a perfectly talented rep. - Later there will be a certification program to ensure you are up to speedfor now , do your best . <h> When To Perform Field Coaching <p> We want our reps to learn how to self-correct . This means that they will circle the one activity and the one ratio each week to work on . This is the Personal Appraisal Review ( PAR ) . - They will then complete the Personal Improvement Plan ( PIP ) . This includes writing the areas to improve and what they will do to improve . <p> Using this process and learning from the sales manual should fix the problem and increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they probably cant recognize what is wrongthey may be too close to the problem to see it . In fact , in the example of leaving a call-back message , the problem was as simple as talking too fast when leaving a call back numberbut it was hard to notice unless someone else pointed it out . <p> In this case , they should talk to their manager and schedule a coaching call . The manager may do a coaching call personally , ask for the team member to record their call ( typically three exampleswe are looking for patterns , not mistakes , or have another member of the team observe . If done in person , the " coach " would follow the steps of the coaching call below . <p> Please invite anyone who you select as a coach to read this section so they are effective . <h> - The Coaching Call <p> Following are the steps to field coaching : <p> Pre-call briefing tell the rep you wo n't interfere , or help outyou will only observe . You 're there only to identify behavior . Ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical or online ) . <p> Observed the rep giving three separate presentations if possible you are looking for patterns , not mistakes and should see him demo , close , overcome objections , or a specific area requested more than once . <p> Make notes silently jot down how the rep is doing with all the specific area ( or with all steps of the sale if it is a general coaching call ) while you are watching him . <p> Be wise do not tell the rep anything about his performance between demos or he will change that behavior and you wo n't see his typical presentation . <p> Never EVER step in and try to save the salebite your tongue ! The lessons learned are more important that closing that particular deal . Besides , they may be able to re-visit the account again to try again in many cases . <p> The wrap up chat when you have completed the last presentation then meet and have him pull out his training manual ( or pull it up online ) . Circle or point out two areas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contentsplease do not overwhelm him with anything more than two ( hold back ) or you wo n't help him . If his presentation is good but his performance/motivation is lacking , then circle the job description section , the " Super Seven Success System , " the weekly bonus , etc. and identify the area to work on . <p> Ask him to complete a P.I.P . ( Performance Improvement Plan ( from " The Game of Work " ) ) and to give you a copy . It is best if he can take the 5-10 minutes right then and complete the form . <p> Explain that you will follow up on his P.I.P . the following week . <p> Praise him . Now is the time to reinforce EVERYTHING you caught him doing RIGHT . <p> Thank him . Tell your rep how much you appreciate his efforts to improve and express your confidence in his ability to improve the areas you helped identify . Express your expectations that he continue all his good behavior that you also identified . <p> Complete the first part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly reports . <p> Follow up . Remember , Goals begin behavior , consequences maintain it . If the representative has not completed his P.I.P.do not let him off the hook . For the reps sake , he must improve his performance to the standard to be successful at his job . <p> If the rep has several major areas that need to be improved ( you can only work on a few at a time ) then wait until he has completed his current improvement and then reschedule another coaching and/or model call to fix the other areas ( ONLY two at a time ) . <p> The basic rule on the number of visits : You must do as much training as is necessary to get a reps performance up to the " Standard of Performance " as soon as possible . He does n't  have to be perfectbut if he s got faults ( sloppy presentation , boring , disorganized , does n't  know product/service , etc. ) that are big enough that he ca n't close , then his problems must be fixed or he wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or model calls you make , whether its 1 or 10you must do whatever it takes to fix the bugs ( period ) . We do n't  want to float with a number ( like 4 visits ) but wed all agree that we- must be willing to help at least once each month if anything , just to show our support and to prevent " de-training " ( resorting back to bad habits ) . <p> This self governing approach should not be abused , howeverif a manager does n't  train his people because he s not wise enough to make the time , and its obvious by a reps poor performance or when he comes to training , then we will have to use " situational " leadership and direct that manager to have a certain number of rep field calls . We do not want that to happen , but at least you know what to expect if you do n't  use your own initiativehint , hint . <p> One point to consider : " If " anyone requires over 4 sessions for a single area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not humble enough to be teachable and might not be salvageable in this role . Consider this when deciding which reps should continue if you can not help them . <p> Congratulations , you have learned the steps to an effective coaching call ! Give yourself a one minute praising ! <h> The Model Call <p> The Model Call is simple . If a rep is not able to improve his performance on his own , by studying the training materials , or by making changes via a coaching call , then he usually need to see what good performance looks like , by example . Have the rep observe a few of your managers or peers appointments so they can actually show him , by example , how to improve his weak areas . Depending on the circumstances , and your schedule , you might schedule a model call ( and see how it should be done ) immediately after the coaching call . If you wish , you may also have him observe another rep on the team who is strong in the area needing improvement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be helped and his performance is still not acceptable ( not within the range of the standard of performance ( the average of the entire group ) ) , and you can not help them , then you need to find a replacementand they need to find work that they can succeed at ( not everyone is good at everythingits just a matter of fit ) . Remember to let the office know of the situation so they can document the problem and approve the reassignment before talking to the rep about moving him over to another area or division , etc. - We hate to lose somebody but it is better to let a rep go than to risk losing an entire account , or several accounts , because he will not or can not change his performanceand it is better for the rep to be doing work he/she is more suited for . <h> Win The Game of Work <p> Remember , a team member can improve every area if they follow this process . First , they need to try to self-correct with the P.A.R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coaching call and/or see how it should be done with a model call . These are the tools that a good manager will use to help their team become successful . If done properly , and by having fun playing " The Game of Work , " they will improve and master one area at a time until all skills are optimizedthen they are the master of the game . Theyll also be much more happy with their work and increased income .

They are inexpensive ( I pay $8.00/hour ( $10 now with the new min wage ) , plus bonuses in the US ( more else ware ) ) , easy to recruit ( college campus job postings ( I hire out of universities ) and Craigs list ( avg 15 or so resumes ) both cost nothing to post in many areas ( $25 in otherscheap ) ) , can usually be recruited within 1-2 weeks , they are highly motivated ( want a good recommendation , lots of energy ) and they are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a highly directive management style with a marketing intern ( which is what they wantsince theyve seldom done anything I am asking previously ) , and I must provide detailed plan of actions ( I have every single step I ever ask of them outlined as a repeatable process ) . Its great for you since you are able to start new initiatives ( like building a reseller program , creating alliances , setting up an affiliate program ) , or with ongoing tasks ( I 've had some do graphics design , others help with events , competitive research , do the leg work to test our business model , etc . ) . <p> In addition , Interns absolutely love doing " real " marketing , get to learn advertising ( doing the media research ) , product management ( helping to compile and prioritize features ) , or even the specialized field of Channel Marketing , and I get the resources I need on the cheap . <p> Plus , I 've hired several of my marketing interns full-time in the past ( a two-way try-before-you-buy approach ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intern . Of the 8 companies I am currently consulting with5 now have marketing interns that I helped them get to execute our plans . <p> I average 1-2 hours of my time for every 10 hours of theirs ( I provide initial direction , allow them to execute , then review and redirect if needed ) . It works great when there is a lot of real leg work that must be done ( I use them to setup the reseller , the affiliate and the alliance programs , plus the activity of sending responses and following up , and the database research , etc . ) . <p> I have the marketing intern compile my list of targeted resellers , send my 3 initial e-mails , follow up with a phone call , send the 2 follow-up e-mails , do the subsequent phone follow-up and the reseller orientation ( review of the portal and overview of the product ) . I already have all the templates for everythingthey just have to personalize them and execute . <p> For systems , I set them up with Goldmine or ACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vonage ( cost $29 w/tax per month ) . I only require they have their own PC ( typical for college student ) , and a high speed internet connectionthen they can work from home if they wish ( like school work ) . <p> Works great , we are able to get a LOT of activity done , and it helps you to execute with a vengeance on the new initiatives ( like building a channel ) even if you 've already got a full-time job . <p> Following is a typical job description I use for a marketing intern , followed by a link to a sample ad I use , along with additional recruiting resources . <h> Marketing Intern Job Description <p> Reports to : - Company for all company related items " time worked , orientation , resources , etc. ) . - To Chanimal ( for direction , mentoring , follow-up ) . Works closely with small start-up team to help build the channel , affiliates and alliances . <p> General Description <p> The marketing Intern will help to a ) define and build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the alliance program ( including the alliance relationships and affiliate program ) , and help with PR , ads , copywriting , the company database , customer follow-up and events . <p> Duties include : <p> Partner Program <p> Help setup the reseller program including assisting with PowerPoints , competitive matrix , price list , collateral and other materials needed . <p> Follow-up with alliance partners to execute respective plan of actions <p> Reporting : <p> Prepare a weekly status report for the weekly meetings . This report would consist of an update from the channel and alliance program master checklist with dates , the status and follow-up results from each category . <p> Maintain time spent on activities . <p> Budget <p> Help create and track a modest budget . <p> Knowledge &amp; Skills <p> Candidate should be capable of initiating and maintaining strong personal relationships . In addition , he/she should be able to coordinate with all the departments involved to ensure the completion of the associated marketing programs . A high degree of organization and self-motivation is required . This person must quickly learn the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upcoming company opportunities to ensure participation with the reseller partners whenever it makes sense . <p> Prefer a responsible Junior-Senior in college working on a business degree ( marketing preferred since this will be applicable experience ) with technical aptitude . <p> Marketing Intern Pay <p> Minimum Wage plus bonus based on growth and deliverables ( to be defined within first two weeks ) <h> Intern Hiring Resources <p> Local University . Local colleges and universities have physical and online job boards . If you are local , you can post a physical job posting for a marketing intern , or you can log-in and then post ( usually there is a pre -approval where the university validates you are a legitimate companyno 100% commission jobs are typically permitted . <p> InternshipPrograms ( **25;28;TOOLONG ) . Search engine dedicated to both posting and searching for interns . Subsiderary of Career Search . <p> Barefootstudent.com ( www.barefootstudent.com ) . I 've used them a few times , but only got a few respondents ( vs Craigslist where I may have gotten 20 during the same time ) . I never hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than Craigslist ) . <p> You can also post with your local newspaper , but the cost is high and the response is similar to Craigs List ( which is free or $25 ( depending on your area ) ) . <p> Once I post , I usually get 5-20 resumes within the following 3 days . <h> Intern Hiring Criteria <p> I 'm often asked what kinds of questions I should ask , what should I look for and what are the steps : <p> 1 . Place the ad . I always use Craigslist ( better than even the school , Barefoot , student , etc. ) 2 . Here is a sample of the copy I use : LONG ... <p> ( this one is not very techy , but the others are similar ) . - The only part we need to modify is the first paragraph or two. - The BEST interns have lots of opportunities and they are looking for the greatest growthwe provide that and that 's how we compete against the bigger companies. - They also get to do real worknot just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section then leave it like it is . <p> 3 . Once the resumes come in ( I usually wait a few days so I have enough to review ) , then I sort and rate on a 1-5 scale ( 5 is high ) . - 1-2 are not fits . 3s look good . 4s I call and I only rate someone a 5 after they prove themselves in the job . I do not care as much about experience as capability ( some very good workers may have just waited tablesthese are utility jobs to survive school and show initiative , but not relevant skills ) . - I look for these items : <p> a ) Marketing , Journalism , Economics , English , Business and sometimes some engineering ( so long as they want to do marketinglike I did ) major . b ) Any prior internships ( shows they are trying to get ahead , trying to decide what they want to do ( not just sitting around playing games ) c ) Anything that shows stability ( years at any jobeven MacDonalds ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  workfollow instructions , but do n't  always use initiativenot critical ) . - Anything lower they may not be responsible or have too many jobs . e ) Involvement. - Clubs , bands , associationsshows engagement and passion . f ) Sports or Band . Both require guts to stay with them and if they dothey become good at it . Shows character. - In sales , when we would interview over 300 students a year , success is sports was the single most common denominator of our top people . g ) Leadership . Did they start and then excel or were they happy to be one of the masses . Did they have ambition that made them work harder . Sports is good , Captain of the team is even betterothers saw things in them that we may not see in a 30 minute interview . h ) English skills . 1-5. - 3 or higherhave to know how to write . I ) Passion . Were they an Eagle Scout ( only 6% of scouts ever achieve it ) . Did they get scholarships . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get excited about our product they can do well . j ) Relevant experience . Helpful , but not critical . Most of what they have done may be basic level anyway , so I do n't  careI care more that they are interested in marketing ( or whatever they plan to do forever ) . <p> These are the main things I interview for. - BTW , many resumes wont have theseI look for signs within their resume ( they coach footballthey probably played , how many years , lettered , leadership ? ) .

The company has an open door policy , which means that everyone is welcome to talk to any manager at any level ( including the CEO ) . However , team members should be advised that they should always talk to their direct manager first ( even if they doubt it will be effective ) , - and only escalate it if they can not get everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher level , before giving your direct manager a chance to address it is political , is unfair and unethical , and creates a culture that lacks trust . <p> Office politics .

Motivated by short-term gains " promotions , funding for a project , budget increases , making a single ( often trivial ) point , status with the boss " people misuse their time and energy . Often a person is even willing to sacrifice another persons career , for the sake of a short term gain ( even if it is a simple opinion ) . - Following are a few of the typical games people play : <p> Gotcha : identifying and communicating others mistakes in an effort to win points from higher-ups <p> Gossip : engaging in the classic rumor mill to gain political advantage <p> Gray Zone : deliberately fostering ambiguity or lack of clarity about who should do what to avoid accountability <p> All of these approaches are selfish , destroy trust since they are not win-win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing against themselves as tribes , instead of focusing on the market competitors . <p> The resolution : - In two words , " STOP IT .

@@121328680 @10328680/ <h> Situational Leadership <p> We want to address management style first , since it is critical that you understand why we are using a directive and coaching style to teach these concepts. - But also so you 'll know that this initial style will soon change to supportive and delegative ( where we leave you alone ) as you master the concepts. - Knowing this will help you to be receptive to the new concepts , without being resentful that you 're receiving so much instruction ( which you may or may not already know ) when you may already consider yourself a professional ( and most of you are ) . - Please stay with us and you 'll understand the value of this approach as we level-set the entire team . <h> A Management Style <p> A proper management style can make or break an organization . Unfortunately , most of us have been the victim of a bad managerin fact , it is usually the norm rather than the exception . It often involves a manager ( CEO to the first level supervisor ) who becomes impatient , appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day ) , who may spy on his team , hover and over manage , or completely neglect his teamproviding no help , insight or direction. - Of course , then he blames his team and hangs them out to dry when they do n't  perform to his expectations ( whatever they aresince he never said ) . <p> We may observe that some managers are always directivetelling everyone what to do all of the time . Others are always delegative-they hire you and then do nothingexcept when you mess up. - Then they resort to " Seagull Management " they fly in , crap all over the place , and fly out . <p> Unfortunately , for us to be successful we often have to find a manager that matches where we are in our career. - We are fine with a directive manager when we are doing a new job ( at least for awhilethen we move on when we get better and no longer need help ( and the company never benefits from our best performance ) ) . - We also do well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated ( when they let us do our job ) . - The problem occurs when we are in the middle of our career , or take on additional responsibility and are good at part of our job ( the old part ) , but new at the other part. - We may get caught in the middle , cant manage expectations , and our good manager suddenly turns bad ( since he does n't  know how to fix the problemso he flies in ) . <p> Sometimes the employee is sent back down the ranks assuming he ca n't handle the upper echelonwhen it was really the managers problem , not the employees ! <p> The problem. - Most managers do not have a conscientious or systematic approach to managing or leading teams . They do n't  know how to handle different situations and so they hack out an approach that is often based on their prior experienceoften with bad managers , whom they emulate , rather than improve uponlike a child raised by an abusive parent ( and continue to mess up the team ) . <h> The Solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible management style that allows them to nurture new employees and provide additional help when existing employees take on new responsibilities , but they also should be able to delegate responsibilities entirely to capable and motivated employeesthey need a flexible style. - One such approach is called " Situational Leadership . " <p> Situational Leadership is a flexible management style that adjusts the management approach according to the employees capability and motivation with each of their current roles. - Heres how it works : <p> Define the roles . First , the manager must define the roles of the employee. - It is hard to hold anyone accountable unless they first know exactly what we expect. - A job description that defines the responsibility and expectations for each role is essential. - We also have to make sure there is no overlapping of roles and that the roles do not contradict the persons primary objective ( i.e. , sales doing HR , instead of concentrating on sales ) this is easier as the company grows and we have to specialize . <p> Rate capability for each role . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of their roles. - They might receive a " 1 " for a new area they know nothing about and will need lots of direction and help , a " 2 " for an area they know something about but need coaching and review to master it , a " 3 " for an area they have experience and are competent withbut need support to build their confidence , and a " 4 " for an area where they are fully capable ( often better then we are ) and highly motivated , in which case they would be delegated the full responsibility . <p> Apply a different style to each role . The manager would use a different style for each roledepending on their rating . For example , assume you had the following roles : A ) Tie your shoes , B ) Create a press release and C ) Build a bomb . Where would you rate your ability with each role ? <p> You would invariably be at a 4 ( delegative ) for tying your shoes . In fact , it would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes ( perhaps left over right , instead of right over left ) . <p> For creating a press release you may be between 1-2. - You may have created an outline before , but youve never had to create a press release from scratch. - You may need some direction to start ( 1 Directive ) , plus you will want your manager or another person with more experience to review your work and make suggestions ( 2 Coaching ) . Of course , once you 've created several job descriptions you may not need any direction , or coaching , but instead you may need reinforcement ( 3 supportive ) to build your confidence , until you have mastered it ( 4 Delegative ) . <p> For creating a bomb , you better be in the directive ( 1 ) quadrant or you 're probably doing the wrong job ( perhaps the military might work ? ) . <h> The Model <p> As you can see from the grid , there are four basic management styles : <p> Directive . Give direction , samples , templates and examples . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new and want help. - It helps if the person directing knows how it should be done and what good results look like . Directive can be bad and even insulting when you are already experienced , capable and motivated . <p> Coaching . The manager , or mentor , would review new work , provide edits and re-direction or additional samples . This helps the employee correct and refine their work until they get it right . <p> Supportive . The manager would review and then validate that it is done correctly . This " pat on the back " helps build confidence . <p> Delegative . The manager assigns a task to a capable and motivated employee and expects it done correctly. - The manager only needs a copy of completed work . The employee is fully capable and motivated and can do the task correctly ( hopefully even better than those they report to ) . They have earned the right to be delegative . <p> The role for a good manager is the apply the correct style to each of the specific roles of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the employee masters each role . <h> Safe Learning Style <p> Situational Leadership is a " safe " style since employees can risk taking on new responsibilities ( roles ) without feeling that they will lose credibility in their overall job if they need help ( show weakness ( actually , humility and teach ability is a good thing , not bad ) ) . - If this is the managers style , and an employee is new to a role , they can ask for and receive important direction . They can also expect coaching until they master it , then support until they own the responsibility ( delegative ) . <p> The fact that an employee is seeking direction and coaching in a new role does not mean that they are considered incompetent in the other areas of there job where they may have earned the right to be delegative. - It also means that if they have messed up in an area where they were previously delegative ( forgot to lock the door to the office when you left ) , it only affects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to double check all the doors before they leaveif they comply , the style goes right back to delegative. - It also does not mean that the other 4-5 roles of their job are affected. - As such , they only go backwards in one area ( so it can be fixed ) , but they retain credibility in their other roles . <p> The job of a good manager is to help their team members to get to delegative in ALL areas of their position. - If an employee can not move from directive to coaching to supportive to delegative , then they may not be a good fit for the job . In which case specific roles may need to be adjusted , or they may have to do a different job all together . <p> For example , one employee was an engineer by background . However , the division needed someone to correlate inventory levels with incoming sales ( an operational role ) . The individual was given the assignment , lots of direction , but could not get it done on time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not detailed enough ) . - After numerous re-directs without success , the employee was re-assigned to something else ( back as an apps engineerwhich they were superb at ) . - Operations was just not a good fit , and the person could not progress to delegative , no matter how many times it was attempted . <p> A good manager also can not do their job ( do things that only they can do ( like payroll , operations , etc. ) ) when they have to keep going back to directive , or have to keep coachingrather than progressing their team members to be delegative . <p> As an employee gets new roles they should expect their manager to give them lots of direction , samples , templates , and then review their work with coaching , redirection and examples ( models ) . As they become capable , the manager should help build their confidence until they can do the job entirely on their owndelegative. - They should never be afraid to admit that they need helpor they will never master all of their job or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each role within their existing job , and also the pattern when they accept new responsibilities . <p> Everyone loves this management style. - It helps employees to learn their responsibilities thoroughly until they own the job , and it also gives them a chance to grow as they learn and master new responsibilities. - Team members should be able to grow in a safe environment , and the company grows as competence increases . <p> Eventually , a good manager has a highly capable and motivated team and can spend time on team strategy , not tactics. - As a managers effectiveness is recognized he often advances and receives new responsibilitiesand everyone continues to advance and grow . <h> Consistency In the Ranks <p> Consistency is key. - This Situational Leadership style is the primary management approach within Chanimal . It is important that everyone understand , master and expect it. - It is something we do together with the teamnot " to " the team ( which is why it also explained in the sales manual and other places ) . If a single manager ( CEO to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupts the entire chainand the confidence that this is a safe place to learn , grow , and improve dissipates quickly , team members start to close down and are not willing to take risks and move forwardwhich is essential for a fast growing progressive team that expects to dominate our entire market space . <p> Learning to become a situational leader may take time . As a manager you may " fly back to Seagull " at times and may need direction , coaching and support until you master it . Everyone should be patient as we all grow and practice this style until it becomes engrained in our cultureand creates the environment we all want . <p> Finally , please note that direction and coaching is part of our culture ( to start ) . - As we join Chanimal team members should expect and welcome lots of direction and help . They should also expect that they will be able to be more independent and self actualized as they progressnone of us will not want to be directive for long. - So let 's all learn our material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will all succeed together . <h> - Review Questions <p> What is Seagull Management ? <p> List from memory the four basic management styles . <p> List five current areas of responsibility with your current job . <p> Rate all five areas of your responsibility ( above ) and determine which management style would be used for each . <p> Why is Situational Leadership considered a " safe " management style ? <p> What should you expect if you or your team members are new in a specific role ?

One application that I have had an opportunity to review is ChannelWave at www.channelwave.com . I was VERY impressed ! <p> ChannelWave is a Web-based portal application that allows you to manage EVERY aspect of your reseller relationships . It is a modular application available as an ASP , or installed on your own servers with a start-to-finish deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years like the massive Siebel-like systems . It is available in a highly tailored enterprise version , or a pre-configured modular and customizable mid-market edition . <p> The core product allows you to sign up resellers ( with a configurable qualifier that can gather the initial screening information , and then later ask more detailed questions ) , explain your reseller program ( by levels w/benefits and requirements ) , allow multiple contacts per location to sign up , take the reseller through the training process and manage all co-op and MDF funds automatically or by manual pre-approval . <p> Additional sales and marketing modules allow you to capture leads through Web-based forms and ( using rules you setup via checkboxes ) automatically assign these leads to your resellers , and even re-assign the same lead to a different reseller if the original reseller does not follow up within a pre-assigned time period . Of course the system automatically pushes fresh lead summary information out via e-mail encouraging the reseller to log in for additional information and follow-up . This is the way to convert leads to sales and ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially with a pile of tradeshow leads . <p> The system also allows you to post all of your collateral , sales training material , sales tips , etc. in the Information Center module even allowing users to rate the value of each file with " stars " - ( good for marketing feedback so you do n't  create what they do n't  value ) , and for other visitors to know where the good stuff is . Of course , you can broadcast out to everyone on their personalized home page ( which the user can configure at will like " My Yahoo " ) or determine what each individual user sees by group ( all platinum level resellers ) , by type ( retail or alliance partner , versus the highest level system integrator ) , or by individual . <p> Usually this much flexibility comes at the expense of weeks of custom development . Instead , ChannelWave has thought of most of the options you would typically want , and allows you to turn them on and off with check boxes . Other items can be easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard nut during the presentation , but there was n't a single thing that I wanted to do that wasnt already pre-built into the systemincluding the ability to add a field on the fly ( try that with Siebel ) .

Needless to say , you need to CHECK THIS OUT ! <p> I received a live demo through a painless remote demonstration via the Internet while simultaneously talking on the phone . I could have gone on for hours , but we both had other commitments . <p> BTW , ChannelWave was acquired since this review , so their website URL is no longer active. - I left this link because of the in-bound links to this page , and it is an introduction to PRMs for some .

Good field reps are good thinkersthey can diagnose a situation and then decide what products market features will best apply . <p> Again , just like a doctor , however , all you can do is prescribe a cure . You can not force a dealer to accept your cure .

You must paint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking your product becomes important to him . <h> Selling The Benefits <p> Elmer Wheeler once said , " Sell the sizzle not the steak . " Your job is to sell benefits . Selling benefits , simply means showing how your product can fill the needs of your dealers customers and hence fill your dealers own needs of providing profitable goods and services . Remember , you 're not selling software and hardware , you are selling benefits ! <p> While selling benefits , it is important to give logical reasons for buying , but you must also appeal to the emotions . Appealing to the emotions simply means selling the benefits of your product which are most appealing to your dealer . <h> Example : Ami Pro <p> Because Ami Pro rated " highest overall ease of use , " the customer will feel less frustration with the product and the dealer will now spend less time with tech support . <p> With Amis ATM fonts , dot matrix printers will print betterthe dealer can move his printer stock and free up more money to spend at home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wants an easy " desktop publishing " program . They also wanted to buy more word processors . Now the dealer has a better chance to help a major client and earn the associated money . <p> One of your dealers biggest clients are Lotus 123 users and have been considering upgrading to 123 for Windows . Now your dealer can attempt to close them on the " double up offer " - ( both 123 &amp; Ami Pro for Windows ) and beat out the competitors who are n't  aware of this special . <p> The dealer is the secretary of a local Elks club . He was just assigned to write a monthly newsletter . Now he can use AMI Pro instead of two programs ( Word Perfect AND Pagemaker ) . Its faster and frees his time for other things . <h> Buying Signals <p> A good way you can tell if you are selling the benefits effectively and personalizing your presentation to fill the needs , problems , and desires of your dealers is through " buying signals . " - The following are examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution ? " <p> " How long does it take to get it in ? " <p> " Are there any specials for this product ? " <h> Hot Buttons <p> " Hot Buttons " are also buying signals . Throughout every sales presentation always listen for your dealers " Hot Buttons . " All needs , problems , and desires that are brought up by the dealer in the presentation are " Hot Buttons . "

@@121328785 @10328785/ <h> Background <p> I was excited when I reconnected with Gordon Graham , " That White Paper Guy , " just to keep the relationship alive , and discovered he had been selected to author a book about White Papers for the well-respected Dummies series . I could n't think of a more qualified candidate . I asked him to send me a copy so I could review it . He sent me two ( one got sent to an old addressso he sent it again ( Thanks Gordon ! ) ) . <p> I first heard about Gordon when he was the editor ( and author ) of the newsletters for SoftwareCEO ( part of CompTia ) , when I sat on the advisory board . But the first time I learned that he wrote white papers was when I was approached by an SEO company to link to his white paper content from Chanimal.com . I looked at his site and content and immediately linked and was happy to reconnect and talk about his white paper experience . Actually , I was looking for validation that the approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers was correct . He provided some great tips , but he also referred me to places where I could publish my white papers for freea great tip . I even referred several of my clients to his service . <h> - Review <p> Upon arrival , I noted White Paper for Dummies had all the hallmarks of the Dummies series , including well-organized format and conventions with tips , things to remember , true stories and warnings . It is also comprehensive and covers some of the history of white papers , the reasons for creating a white paper , but also some tips for freelancers ( including potential revenue figures and ways to keep clients focused and happythese are saavy tips for any freelancer ) . <p> The book then defines what a white paper is and what it is notspecifically it is not a puffery piece ( and even includes words to avoid ) , but instead it is a proof piecea persuasive essay that uses facts and logic . It is especially helpful when you have evidence ( and he details sources and types of credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product or service you provide solves a real , juicy , nasty problemusually in a way that is unique and critical to the user ( and industry ) . It is the ultimate proof piece that validates your positioning , creating in the mind of the reader the impression , " I would be a fool not to consider this . " He also points out that the pragmatic result of every white paper is that it should produce a lead ( thank you for the validation an ROI for the cost and effort ) . <p> Of course , having authored several white papers ( but as a sidelinenot my main profession ) , I was especially hunting for things I had never known . The three types ( flavors ) of white papers was interesting , 1 ) the backgrounder , 2 ) the list and 3 ) the problem/solution white paper . I had only used the problem/solution formatas the most convincing " king of content " ( as he describes it ) . Each flavor has its own purpose , but I think I 'll continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to write it ( or set the direction ) since I am looking for maximum " persuasivity . " <p> All said and done , the acid test ( from a marketing practitioner who has to constantly defend his budget ) is , " will it generate enough interest ( curiosity ) to produce a LOT of qualified leads ? " <p> The book also contains well-documented sample processes including ways to ensure clarity , set expectations , but also avoid derailment from those with a title and veto powerthat neglected to attend the original meeting . This is SO critical or the white paper can get line edited and messed up at the furthest stage by someone who came in late , did n't  understand the purpose or format , and has an " ignorant " opinion , but with absolutely no track record of successfully generating leads with white papers . This process alone is worth getting the book . <p> I also liked his typical times and prices for different types of white papers ( I wo n't spoil itget the book ) . His recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , along with choosing the right kinds of graphics and an effective title . His recommendation to use odd numbers with a list format ( increases credibility ) was helpful , as was following good typography for easy reading , plus his caution about how to address competitors ( although I like to deposition them and the entire categoryif I have the facts to prove it ) . <p> Gordons section on sources for white papers , along with the rules for " evidence " like proximity , authoring , timeliness and relevance were terrific . Againproviding credible proof to make your white paper and argument bullet-proof . As he points out , weak minded , feeble research and vague generalities have no place in a proof paperor it works against you . <p> The most valuable new information I learned was his check list of " must " and " could do " promotions . Like he says , why spend so much effort to produce a persuasive white paper and then not get it out there to generate leads . I also appreciated the English tipsincluding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the reason for the minus in my A- that I got in college English ) . <p> The only thing I felt was missing was a template for a persuasive problem/solution white paperundoubtedly because I was looking to validate or correct the template that I already use ( but I 'm sure he can add it to his website , ThatWhitePaperGuy.com ) . Even still , this is a really comprehensive and helpful bookI got through it ( with notes ) , in between meetings , in only a few days . <p> Congratulations on a terrific book that will help beginners and advanced white paper writers alike . I give it five Chanimals ! Add it to your libraryit will serve you well .

Additionally , it must be listed in conjunction with the product , and not the footnote . <p> Rebates are not considered MAP compliant . <p> Note that Company bundles are subject to the General Map Rules above . Moreover , Company may sponsor promotions and rebates .

Should the Company Product be viewed as the result of utilizing the search function , the first time the product appears as a result of that search , the price shown must be MAP compliant . Additionally , listings on shoppers sites and " paid for " advertising must follow MAP guidelines . <p> A " catalog " format on your site that lists the product , product description and " buy or purchase " button is not considered advertising and is considered your selling price ( as long as it is not the front page of your website or front page of a section and the requirements of the previous paragraph are met ) . <p> MAP Communication <p> This MAP policy may be changed by Company at any time at its sole discretion .

If an exception is granted , the Reseller must correct the non-compliance within one ( 1 ) business day . If the error is on a website , the advertised price must be changed . If the error is in print , a retraction must be printed . <p> Non-compliance Notification <p> Company will notify the Reseller in writing of the non-compliance . <p> MAP Policy Questions <p> MAP compliance is the responsibility of the Reseller .

A phone detailing program would commence once the product is introduced to place eval copies , ensure all collateral POP is set up and to ensure compliance for promotions . <p> Employee seeding offers . Aggressively push a $10 employee copy to help reps own and learn the product .

ACE , as it collectively come to be known , initiated a fundamental change in the nature of the user interface , moving it to a human-centered design . All of this was in an effort to make computers more responsive , and focused around a basic realization : if something is represented sensually , it is possible to make sense of it . In regard to the Web , this new ACE approach put the " AC " in " ACE . " <p> An outgrowth of this perception founded the introduction of ACE in May of 1994 . The current and expanding ACE specification now allows users to navigate through two-dimensional animal-like worlds with the same ease as clicking on a Web hyperlink .

According to Grape Welsh at Intelligent Corporation , there are about 100 current ACE sites . The more sites that support ACE the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webmasters . This is a variable that Acme can affect by the on-line marketing efforts ; discussed further in the " on-line marketing " section . <p> The acceptance of ACE as a continuing standard . Although most of the industrys largest players are pushing for a uniform ACE 2.0 standard , there are some companies , such as Microstuff and others ( with ActiveACE and ACE+ ) , that are moving ahead with their own strategy . " ActiveACE will bring the Internet alive for millions of users by making rich , animated multimedia an everyday part of the on-line experience , " said Paulened Toofar , group vice president of the platforms group at Microstuff.Without a firm consensus the ACE market could , vis-a-vis Microstuff and others , get splintered which may put Acme in a better or worse market position depending on how the standard lines up with the existing Chanimal ACE export . The standard is being re-defined during February 2000 and this will tell us how , if any , the market segment will grow and how Acme will be affected . To ensure our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining this standard . <p> The speed and participation of development producing viable applications will also affect ACE growth . According to Toni Tiger , CTO of ACEvilla Software , Inc. , the development community has fortunately endorsed the overall concept of ACE on the Internet , " As an open standard , ACE has attained critical mass among developers . " This is also highly evident by the sheer number and the credibility of the current developers that have recently jumped onto the ACE bandwagon . One such vendor , TinDontRust , said , " The way people want to interact with the Web is not best served by what we see around todayboring interfaces and browsers based on HTML . We think an interactive , networked ACE world is necessary . " ( Tiny Tim , VP at TinDontRust ) <p> And finally , ACE growth can be affected by the general perception of the validity and usefulness of ACE . This perception is highly influenced by the press and by on-line examples . Sites are coming along , fortunately the ACE coverage has been even better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " These recent breakthroughs in ACE will change the world faster and more profoundly than desktop publishing did a decade ago . " <h> Competitive Environment <p> In response to the early market indicators , Acme has produced the first " complete " cross platform ACE browser . However , there are over 18 other browsers already available ( most still in BETA ) for the Windows sideours , Widget , is slightly late in the game , although it should have a competitive 10x speed advantage when we add our own proprietary format within the next release . <p> Acme Widget1 is , notwithstanding , ahead of the game as one of the few desktop ACE authoring packages that is currently shipping . In a recent ACE authoring tools review by MultiCool World , Acme 's Widget1 was compared to Paralizeds , Virtual Home ACE Builder ( VHAB ) and to Condors , Fussion . Acme 's Widget1 received the highest rating of the three ( with 4 1/2 stars ) but the other two were close behind with four stars eachway too close . The other packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our $495 . In the future , to dominate the category , we will need to win more of these type of awards and with greater margin . We can do that by better skewing the reviews by using more effective comparative review kits . <p> Our updated products to be released throughout the year will help us be even more competitive . The new consumer priced retail package , Widget1a will be a lower-priced ( $99 ) feature laden product designed for mass distribution and general adoption . The later multimedia authoring package , Widget2 , at $495 , will have a narrower width of distribution since it will be targeted toward professionals and should be both the first in its category and the best in its field . More details on the products can be found in the product marketing section . <p> There is obviously more upcoming competition that will infringe on our market share ; although many vendors are still in development . According to the ACE Repository Web site , ACE is currently supported by over 82 different companies ( universities excluded ) . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Present Danger " ( for Clancy fans ) . Microstuff , Strutstuff , Paralized ( published by Bunderbund ) , Paper ACE Software , Nutscape , 3DeadAce , ACEVista , IntersACE , Trispecies , Condor , AutoACE , 2D ACE are just a few of the upcoming competitors we will need to keep a watch onparticularly if they make a run at the consumer channel . <p> As a side note , the shear volume of potential competitors further validates the ACE market potential . When the vultures circle it usually indicates the existence of meat ! ( or perhaps the ACE market is dead ? ? = <h> Acme Opportunities <p> At these initial stages of the ACE market , there are a lot of new sites to be designedand every indicator shows that they are going to be built ( including ours ) . A focus on easy-to-use design tools , and equally easy-to-use publishing tools will lower the barrier to entry to ACE creation to levels appropriate to mass accesswhich is extremely appealing to potential ACE developers ( listed previously ) . <p> Fortunately for Acme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is loosing HTML editing market share to desktop publishing , Nutscape Bronze , and popular word processors ) , ACE will almost never be handwritten . Instead it will require sophisticated graphical tools to create the ACE worlds . These worlds will be constructed in CAD programs and it is this high technical cost of entry which will delay competitors and give Acme a strategical time advantagehopefully time enough to gain an essential ACE market presence and shore up our significant performance advantage before the big guns ( Microstuff , Nutscape , and Adube ) fire off their initial rounds . <p> There appears little question that the ACE category will fill with products . To compete in this crowded category , Acme must have a strongly executed Chanimal marketing mixwhich will be covered next .

For credibilitys sake it is usually preferred to rep a " premium " product " if " you are capable of selling its premium features . Regardless , it is your job to properly position the product in the eyes of the dealer . One way to do this is to do a " price savings buildup . " <h> What is a " Price Savings Buildup ? " <p> A " price savings buildup " is comparing a product to similar items showing the great savings , value and benefits that it provides . <h> What Are Ways You Can Do a Price Savings Buildup ? <p> Each product you rep may or may not have all of the key selling features : a price advantage , exceptional quality , and unique feature benefits ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages , although it is not typical ) . However , each product should have a strong market edge that gives you a handle to promote .

@@121328919 @10328919/ <h> Chanimal Engagement Process <p> Initial call . The first step is to call so we can briefly discuss your company , product and objectives . If we see a good enough fit , we proceed to the Analysis call . <p> Analysis call . The second step is to conduct a phone interview to evaluate your objectives , financing , budgets , organization , strategy , product , pricing , placement and promotions . We are looking for capabilities and holes that can be fixed to meet your objectives and move to the next level . This meeting does not cost you anything and typically takes 90 to 120 minutesunder NDA . Within this meeting we can discuss if and how I can help the team . If we agree to proceed , I then create the plan of action ( usually within 2-3 hours ) . <p> Plan of Action . The third step is to create a high and detailed level , sequenced plan of action that takes into account your objectives ( build a channel , increase sell through , train staff , setup an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capability ( staff and budgets ) , current pricing , sales strategy , product road map and promotional effortswhatever was requested within the analysis call . <p> Review of Plan . The fourth step is to review the plan of action . We then determine if we believe this approach will meet our objectives . We may refine it by adding- or subtracting action items so we can meet the objectives . We also determine internal capability and my level of engagement . Budget , time frames and internal capability will determine to what level of engagement I am needed . We will also consider guerrilla approaches to increase the speed and/or reduce expense ( such as interns that I can train , mentor and manage ) . <p> Set Dates &amp; Execute . Once we agree on the plan and approach , we jointly determine the deadlines , who will do what and execute . <p> Collaboration . To facilitate good collaboration , I recommend a primary and secondary contact ( in case the primary contact is unavailable ) , and request a short 20-30 minute weekly collaboration meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any changes , etc . <p> Ongoing Assistance . Once you are part of the micro consulting program you are welcome to call anytime ( I 'll call back if I 'm on the line ) , or e-mail anytime with any questionor re-direct me to work on anything outside of the plan if needed . You will have full access to my experience , counsel and network . <p> Billing . The monthly retainer should be sent once we have reviewed the plan and agreed on the level of engagement . I do not have the bandwidth to deal with accounts receivable ( especially from the larger companies that push for net 60 ) , so the retainer amount should be sent at the beginning of each month of engagement . Any amounts over the fixed amount have to be pre-approved by you , and are due 14 days from receipt . <p> I had no idea how deep Ted could go with analyzing our existing channel program and strategy in under one months time . The result I received was a highly detailed action plan that was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead you into longer and more expensive engagements , but to deliver value in any time period you hire him .

His repeatable processes , templates and deep experience enables him to cover more ground faster than anyone I 've ever seen.Don Gracy , VP Bus Dev , PTC <p> He combines his extensive knowledge and experience with playbook style templates for quickly creating a marketing plan that is tailored specifically for the needs of any tech company . Finally , the best part is that he then helps in systematically executing on that plan so his clients can see real results . Deepak Singh , CEO , AccuProcess <h> Detailed Process for Creating a Reseller Program <p> I often get questions about the steps that go into creating a reseller program on a consulting project . Following are the steps and what you get when we engage : <p> The Micro Consulting does not have fixed deliverables ( i.e. a " completed " reseller program , 50 guaranteed resellers on board , etc. ) specially because we can not control if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings or if the resellers will like the product ( but we usually review that before we even agree to help ) . Instead , we allocate the time it takes to get these items completed " with " the teamwe usually meet 2-3 times per week ( depending on what program you decide ) to knock all this out . <p> NOTE : The list of things to do may appear daunting " but EVERYTHING is documented , there are templates and samples and handholding all along the way and it is completed with team members who have built HUNDREDS of reseller programs ( including some of the most successful programs in the world ( from single person start-ups to the world 's largest high tech companies ( Microsoft , Intel , Apple , Adobe , IBM , Citrix , etc. " several of which started just as small ) , we can take you through everything very quickly and efficiency ( hours , days and weeks " versus months or years trying to do it yourself . <p> Here is what we can typically accomplish as a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DEFINE your reseller program . Review every element of the best-in-class reseller programs with the team to help determine which features go into your partner program ( what goes in the portal ( PowerPoint specifically for a reseller ( has a specific format ) , competitive matrix , market information , collateral , testimonials , etc. ) , what kind of support and training will be needed ( product training , NFR , pre-sales support , online RMA/System Configurator , annual partner meeting , certification program , etc. ) , what kind of lead generation and sales assistance your program would need ( pre-qualified leads , deal registration , bid desk , reseller locator , NFR access , joint promotions ) , your program requirements ( register , qualifications , plan of action , agreement , quotas and frequency ) , and the reseller experience ( pre-sign up phone , grid of program details , east of registration , auto response email , perceived lead gen capability , etc . ) . This usually only takes an hourto review every element as part of the channel education and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Get your portal setup ( the container to house your collateral , policies , etc. for your partners ) . If you host itthen it is included as part of your program ( a WordPress site that takes about 10 minutes to clone and 35 minutes to customize ( includes DETAILED instructions which also serve to teach you the features of your program ) . No cost if you host it on your servers ( we have ALL the details ) , or a nominal cost if you wish to use a similar portal hosted by SaaSMAX . A basic Partner Relationship Manager ( PRM ) costs a minimum of $6,000 $20,000 per year " so the portal and systems alone is worth more than the typical cost of the engagement ( and it is included for free if you self-host ) . <p> Setup All your policies . Based on the elements decided in step one , we then review and customize EVERY partner policy live ( editing your portal content during the review ) . This includes the description of your portal ( public facing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus finalizing the reseller agreement , the lead policy , the NFR policy , the deal registration policy , your initial jump start promotion , MDF/Co-op policy ( as applicable ) , and ALL of the content on all 53 pages of the typical portal . This usually takes 2-3 hours ( and is completed in our regular meetings ) . <p> Work on portal content . We provide templates , samples and instructions and work with you to write and proof any of the content needed to populate the portal . This typically includes market info , competitive analysis ( 3rd most common item requested ) , re-purpose the partner selling PowerPoint , create the price list , determine your reseller margins ( including how to pay , who pays who , when to pay , etc. ) , put the link to the portal and the locator on your website and discuss any provisioning system . There might be other missing content , but this is identified in step 1 . If your value proposition is not dead obvious ( 3-5 reasons why a prospect would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the " persuasive format " and help re-organize your value proposition ( main argument ) since the reseller MUST see this differentiation of they will NOT come on board ( some have a screening team to filter vendors ) . - We then proof the portal , ALL forms and review the processes with the team.This is the longest stages but is completely dependent on what your program needs and what you already have completed ( and whether it can be re-purposed for the partners ( much can ) ) . We address everything holistically ( whatever it takes to get this completed ) . This can range from 1-4 weeks ( completely dependent on what you have done and who can help ) . <p> Complete recruiting content . Determine your CRM systems for partner follow-up , review your email system for the recruiting campaign , talk about the database and how to set it up , create the recruiting email ( we provide samples , templates and help write/proof ) , determine when campaign will start , the 3 step follow up process , who will manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formats ( spacing , check for spam ) , create the orientation demo script , create the product demo script ( PDF add to portal ) , introduce you to the reseller follow-up worksheet , determine who will help resellers with the orientation ( have a detailed " Orientation for a New Channel Person " document to spin up to speedor leverage an intern ) , finalize the reseller approval email . <h> Phase II Recruiting <p> Complete reseller templates . During the periods between emails we put together the reseller templatesspecially the sample landing page that is optimized for SEO ( since your partners will use this content to put your product on their website ) , plus the reseller email template ( to announce they carry the product to their existing prospect database ) . We also complete the marketing meeting agenda. - These will be used as soon as we start the enablement phase.Start to field reseller inquiries . Respond to calls and emails from resellers , plus review reseller applications , send approval emails and setup orientation meetings . <p> Target first 10 resellers . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the ones we practice on to confirm they have everything they need to sell and support the product , that our commission provisioning is setup , and to field and get the answers to most of the questions we will typically seeso we are ready for more advanced recruiting . <p> Turn on match making . This is when we turn on the match making ( if part of your program ) . We can create the filters matched to your exact profile to match you with one of the 83,000 resellers we have in our databases . You are then introduced to these partners systematically ( according to your specific run-rate ) . These often become some of your strongest partners . <p> Review and execute on-going recruiting approaches . We discuss affiliates , alliances ( usually where the biggest group of partners come on board ) , direct response campaigns , telemarketing , etc . By this time most companies have partners and they start to produce revenue ( that helps pay for ongoing recruitingbut we start with the campaigns that have little to no cost ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program can scale to hundreds and even thousands of partners . Fortunately , the channel is THE great multiplier and can be scaled and always produces the highest ROI for time and budget spent . <h> Phase III Enablement <p> Orientation . All new resellers go through the orientation meeting . This typically last one hour and covers an overview of the portal ( so we can review the policies and the content we created for them ) , a product demo ( similar to the one a customer might seeso they get a model of how that works ) , we explain how they place an order and review any special promotions ( we usually recommend a " jump start " margin amount within the first 90 daysso they have an incentive to start selling immediately ( and to help cover their opportunity cost of picking up a new product ( learning instead of selling ) . We never leave the meeting without setting up the next meeting ( which is our marketing meeting ) . <p> Marketing Meeting . We set this up within 2-3 days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how they make money , what additional services they provide ( and note it in our database as we learn about their capabilities for potential future referrals ) , what promotions have worked for them previously , and setup the first 90 day promotions they will do ( one per month ) to promote the product . The top three things we put on this list becomes their initial marketing plan . <p> Ongoing marketing help . We meet with them on the dates within their plan and provide the SEO template for the product on their site , later the email template ( to introduce the product ) and any other promotions we identified in our meeting . <p> Newsletter . We provide the templates and show samples for the partner newsletter and usually send out the first newsletter to get it started . This will be ongoing to stay in contact with the partners . <p> Thank you emails . We provide the template and the process to ensure we thank and track the resellers for their first two sales " they really appreciate that we even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quotas per Level . When the resellers have made enough sales , we usually re-group to review the process to set the quotas ( we modify the templates and include instruction ) . We do n't do it in advance since we have no idea how much your partners might sell without some history . <p> Setup Certification . As we interact with the partners we will compile the most common problems and questions and start on our training materials so we can use it for certification . <p> Motivation . We would typically work with your internal team to train the person running the channel . We would also review and help you consider SPIFFs , contest , and other approaches that keep the channel motivated . <p> Partner Conference . The channel is filled with sales people that love recognition , need to be trained and like feeling like part of a bigger teamso we usually setup an annual partner conference . The first one is typically a -+ day webinar , but can later expand to an on-site multi-day event " but this is further along when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a complete certification to train all existing and new team members on how to run a channel . Prices and availability are listed on the Website . <h> Master Plan of Action <p> All of these steps are typically outlined in excruciating detail within the Master Plan which is the first item completed at the start of the engagement " it shows ALL the steps and makes it very easy to see where we are in the process , easy for new team members to get up to speed and learn each of the steps. - It is one of the most strategic and tactical documents you ever receive ( the same plan format used to launch Netscape , American Online , division at GE , Motorola and other top selling products ) . <h> Templates <p> We provide dozens of industry best-practice templates , samples and instructions for all stages of the reseller program . Below are examples of some of the content that is part of a typical program : <p> PowerPoint Reseller Template " not the same as your typical in-house presentation . <p> Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it can be addressed meeting-by-meeting with lots of samples and templates to make it come together fast ( our record " engagement to recruiting " 10 hours ) .

@@121328944 @10328944/ 223041 @qwx1083041 <p> I get occasional pushback as to why the typical reseller program should have levels . Following is my response : <p> If you have a lead , and you have 10 resellers in the prospect 's area , who should get it ? <p> The response : the BEST reseller . <p> And how do you determine the best reseller ? <p> This is n't a charity--there is no reason to send a lead to a person that has n't shown they can close a door--let alone a sale . The lead should typically go to the reseller who has the best chance of closing--they have the product knowledge and a proven track record that they can SELL . What if they build part of their business around your product--and they are willing to hit a guaranteed quota ( if they keep getting leads and get more margin ) ? <p> To differentiate them from the normal reseller , let 's call them GOLD . <p> You now have levels . <p> Now what about your Gold partners that want a larger volume discount ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also say they have learned the product well enough to integrate it and to handle both first and second line support . They will commit to a higher quota ( they do it anyway ) , plus are willing to pass a test to prove they can support the customer . Should you treat them the same ( they increased their loyalty and are not treating you the same ) ? No . Let 's call them Platinum . <p> There are your levels . <p> Plus , your program automatically creates the behavior you want--increased exclusivity and loyalty from a shared sales force . <p> BTW , when you have a NEW program , you " announce " you have levels ( to reward commitment ) , but you have to have enough sales history to set them . In addition , when established , everyone comes in a the mid-level to start . Then they have a decent margin to compete , until they can prove they can maintain that levels . The time depends on your sales cycle--if it takes 6 months to close a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to set it up like this to start--so when folks come in later at Gold ( so they can even compete ) , and existing Gold and Platinum complain , you can say they came in the same way--so long as it is fair , it is fine . <p> In addition , levels have been around since the early 80's--resellers know this model and it is NOT too complex for them . Just because you do n't know about it ( new to the channel ) does n't mean you should change a program that has WORKED for decades . Welcome to their world--learn it , leverage it .
