Unlike many other martial arts , where rank promotions can be acquired in relatively short periods and often with very little practical requirements , the Brazilian jiu jitsu belt system is quite strict and difficult to progress through . - You know that unless he bought ' it from a scumbag instructor or awarded it to himself , the holder of a belt is usually at the expected level of competency . <p> It can take upwards of 10 years to achieve the dan ( black belt ) grade , and requires not only technical knowledge , but also verifiable ability in sparring . Competition experience is also often expected . And as there are only a few belts , you will spend a long time on each one . Also , your progress will not be linear . You might spend 1 year at one belt and 5 years at another . It 's both an extremely challenging and rewarding institution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who messes with it . <p> Belts Are Not Always Good Indicators of Ability <p> Belt promotions do n't always go with hand in hand with skill or even knowledge and vary according to the coach and student . Sometimes it 's just down to time in service . Or it can be closely related to the practitioners raw fighting ability and competition performance . In fact , sometimes competitive performance can even slow belt promotion as coaches sandbag ' their best students to increase their likelihood of medalling at tournaments . <p> In jiu jitsu the different belt levels generally equate with the student 's ability . But keep in mind that the dynamism and complexity of the art means that there are many parts to the equation , with physicality and athleticism being two that weigh heavily . So do n't be surprised ( or judgemental ) when the 56 year-old businessman who just received his blue belt after 2 years of hard training is smashed by the 22 year-old linebacker who just started coming to class- 3 months ago . <p> The Plateau is Your Friend <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-levels. - You will often spend weeks or months on plateaus before being rewarded with a jump in ability . Sometimes it will actually seem as if you are getting worse instead of better . But the plateau is actually your friend and is itself an indicator of progress . It is those who have the mental strength to keep going when they find themselves on a plateau that break through to a higher level of ability . <p> Several years ago , black belt Roy Harris wrote a good article detailing what was expected at each belt . I have extrapolated on this and provided a breakdown of what I expect from my students at each belt . Keep in mind that these are just guidelines . <p> No matter what , remember to enjoy the process . Do n't be too focused on achieving the next belt or winning competitions and miss the ride . <h> White Belt : The Empty Cup <p> Frame of Reference <p> As a white belt , your goal is to create a frame of reference for your future learning . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start to formulate a plan for how to acquire it . Think of BJJ as a jigsaw puzzle that you are putting together . At the white belt level is where you create the bordering or outer edges of the picture before you begin filling in the centre . Using things like flow diagrams and a basic curriculum that focuses on the fundamentals will help greatly . <p> Relax ! <p> Learning to relax is an absolutely essential skill and white belt is the best time to acquire it . I can not overstate how important this is . The only way you will be able to do this is by learning to control your ego . <p> Remember : nothing is expected of you at this stage . Try to focus your energy on taking in all the different aspects of the training experience instead of trying to win every sparring encounter . <p> Less is More <p> A major enemy of the white belt is the tendency to try to acquire too much technical knowledge . It may seem counterintuitive , but at this stage learning twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's actually more likely to hinder your progress . It 's far better to get a deep understanding of a few basic movements and techniques than to get confused by an overwhelming number of possibilities . <p> Get in Shape <p> Conditioning is also important for the white belt . Although several weekly bjj classes will eventually cause your body to adapt , this can be sped up with an intelligently designed supplemental training program . I discuss some of the methods I have had success with here . <p> Some Suggested Goals at White Belt : <p> Learn the names of each of the main positions and acquire a basic familiarity with each of them . For example , be able to identify the guard position . <p> Learn to control your ego by accepting that you will be beaten by the more advanced students . If you are big and naturally athletic this will be even more important for you . <p> Get used to the feeling ' of jiu-jitsu . Pay attention to how your body moves on the ground and the way a resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each position technique and try to master it . For example , one guard pass , one submission from side mount , one sweep etc . <h> Blue Belt : Escape Artist <p> Focus on Defence <p> I once asked Roger Gracie , the best jiu-jitsu fighter in history , what made him so good . After thinking about it for a while , he replied : I built my game off a solid defence . I first made it almost impossible for anybody to tap me out . " <p> Hearing that made a deep impression on me . From that point on I focused almost exclusively on my defence . In fact , I will not promote any of my blue belt students to purple until they have a rock-solid defence . I want to see them able to escape from all the major positions and classic submissions with relative ease . I do n't care what flashy sweeps or submissions they can do , if I do n't struggle to control and submit them they wo n't get graded . <p> Get Good at Guard Passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard . To me , passing the guard is the most difficult aspect of jiu-jitsu . And every year it becomes harder , as new more complicated guards emerge . You will spend a great deal of time in opponents ' guards , so it makes sense to become proficient at dealing with them . When one of my students is approaching purple belt , I start grooming him by making him begin most of his sparring matches inside the other player 's guard . <p> Some Suggested Goals at Blue Belt : <p> Have two solid escapes from Mount , Back Mount and Side Mount . <p> Master three techniques for passing the guard , in particular one each from any closed , half and open guard variant . <h> Purple Belt : - Becoming Well-Rounded <p> Learn to Use Momentum <p> This is the belt of movement and momentum . Through the acquisition of timing and sensitivity , you will learn how to use and generate momentum ( as well as redirect the momentum of your opponent ) to achieve many of your objectives . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game at the previous belts will be shaved away . <p> Purple belt is also where you will finish laying the foundation of your entire game . As mentioned earlier , I suggest that the bulk of this foundation be a solid defence . Before you become a senior grade it 's wise to revisit this and make sure that you are a master of escapes and a nightmare to submit . <p> Focus on Your Weaknesses <p> About a year into your purple belt is a good time to do an honest assessment of your game . Figure out where you have the greatest weaknesses ( or ask your coach ) and through focused training make it a goal to turn those areas into your greatest strengths . This will make you a well-rounded fighter that is able to specialise into his style of choice . <p> Dangerous Guard <p> A good purple belt also has a great offence and is dangerous from any position . This is also where the player should start learning to attack using combinations of techniques an initial set up and at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt your guard should be very effective . You should have a familiarity with all the different guards and be very dangerous from at least a couple of them . <p> Some Suggested Goals at Purple Belt : <p> Know and be able to execute 3 combination attacks from guard position . <p> Know and be able to execute 3 submissions from the Side-Mount , Mount and Back-Mount . <p> Become familiar and adept with both using and passing the most commonly encountered variants of the guard position ( de la Riva , deep-half , spider etc . ) . <h> Brown Belt : Forging Your Own Style <p> Shifting from Defense to Attack <p> The brown belt is the point at which your focus will shift primarily from defence to attack . The air-tight defense you laid during the earlier belts will allow you to be much more aggressive in your hunt for submissions , sweeps and passes , as you will have little concern about being attacked or being placed in a bad spot . <p> Dominant From the Top <p> A brown belt is always a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows how to use his body weight and makes sure the fighter underneath feels and carries every ounce of it . He will pass the guard at even the narrowest window of opportunity , and his excellent balance will make him very difficult to sweep while he does so . <p> Depth of Technical Knowledge <p> Even though you will probably develop your own style and preferences , there will be very , very few positions or situations that you will be unfamiliar with as a brown belt You will have learned ( or created ) counters to almost all the most commonly experienced defensive and offensive techniques . This means that you will be one or two steps ahead of lower-level opponents . <p> You also will have several signature ' techniques . These are moves which you know exceptionally well and have a relatively high percentage of success with on almost anyone . <p> Begin Teaching <p> A quality brown belt should be able to teach the art to others . This is actually when many BJJ players realize that they have a passion for teaching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will also understand that teaching is a good way to consolidate the knowledge you have gained up to this point and acquire deeper insight . <p> Holistic Approach <p> By now , as a long-term jiu jitsu player , you have probably started to take a holistic view of your training in the art . You realise that your jiu jitsu performance is intrinsically interlinked with your physical and mental health , so you will seek to improve both using any avenues available . <p> Some Suggested Goals at Brown Belt : <p> Try to teach a few classes at your academy <p> Perfect your weight distribution and balance in the top positions . <p> Have at least two 3-phase ( Attack -&gt; defense counter 1 -&gt; defense counter 2 ) - attack sequences from each of the main positions <h> Black Belt Instinct and Reflection <p> Transcending Technique <p> You now know that there are no absolutes in jiu jitsu and begin to transcend the techniques and guidelines you picked up along your journey . You can easily riff ' during sparring just going where your body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art means that you can instinctively feel ' your way through most matches , even when confronted by a move or situation you 've never seen before . <p> Fresh Eyes <p> The black belt starts to look at everything with a fresh set of eyes . You are now able to take see new nuances in basic ' movements that you 've already practised thousands of times , and continue to improve and refine them . <p> You will also begins to see jiu jitsu in everything and draw inspiration from not only other martial disciplines , but diverse fields of art and study . <p> Quality Human Being <p> Most importantly , the path to the black belt has created ( or enhanced ) a quality human being . <p> By this stage you will know far more about your body , mind and spirit than you did at the start of the journey into jiu jitsu , and you will be acutely aware of your capabilities and limitations . <p> The black belt - is humble , friendly and respectful of others . Although you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seek confrontation and only use your skills and abilities to defend and help those less capable . <p> Some Suggested Goals at Black Belt : <p> Understand that the journey is not over . Remain humble and continue to learn and grow . 
@@60348858 @348858/ <h> 6 Concepts for Effective Guard-Passing in Jiu Jitsu <p> I consider passing the guard to be one of the most difficult of all aspects of Brazilian jiu jitsu , but also one of the most rewarding . Because we spend so much mat-time fighting from- this position , it makes sense to place an emphasis on improving our ability from it . <p> Internalising any of these principles on its own will make a difference to your top game . Choose one and work on it for a couple of weeks . Once you 've mastered it , move onto the next one . Once you have them all in your toolbox and start to combine them effectively you 'll be a nightmare for even the best- guard-players. <h> 1 . Keep Your Centre of Gravity Low <p> The distance of your centre of gravity ( located a couple of inches below your navel ) to the mat is directly proportionate to how likely you are to be swept when you 're in your opponents guard . Every successful sweep requires that the top players centre of gravity be elevated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hips high during the pass ( standing to pass , spearing- your opponent with your- shoulder etc. ) , during which you should always be aware of sweep attempts . Many sweeps can be completely nullified simply by dropping your hips ( and hence your centre of gravity ) to the mat . Generally , your goal should be to get your hips as close to the mat as possible as soon as possible . <h> 2 . Climb the Ladder <p> Think of your opponents body as a ladder , with his feet being the bottom rung . His knees , pelvis , and shoulders represent the other rungs. - Your objective is to continually be working your way higher up the ladder and to never go back down . Once you pass a rung , you never go back to it . <p> Taking into account the disrupt the feet concept mentioned above , the most important rung to get over are the feet . here 's a video in which I explain this concept in more detail : <h> 3 . Disrupt the Feet <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just recently and its made a huge difference . 80 percent Your opponents guard is simply- the hooks created by his feet and ankles . His knees and thighs are secondary . These hooks are the first and most difficult rungs on the ladder to pass and are usually what keep you in whichever kind guard variant you 're trapped in . Just as a thought experiment think how easy it would be to pass the guard of someone with no feet . Or take a training partner and ask him to stop you from passing his guard without using his feet . <p> We can use this to maximum effect by pre-emptively manipulating and controlling the guard players feet and not allowing him to engage these hooks . Now , whenever someone starts trying to use an open guard on me , the first thing I do is grab one or both of his feet and bend it downwards out of the hook shape . Not only does the stop him from controlling you with his feet , it also weakens his whole lower-body and makes the subsequent- steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step of the Ankle-Isolation pass described in the video further down the page is a good example of this principle at work . <h> 4 . Shut the Hips Down <p> Your opponents ability to elevate and camber his hips with bridging and shrimping type movements are large factors in his attempts- to create openings and leverage for submissions and sweeps . While his hands and arms do play a minor role ( specifically , they can be used to manipulate the head and threaten chokes ) , they are not really a major- concern . <p> If you can stop his hips from moving , you can cripple his guard to a large extent and- make the pathway to mount or side-mount easier . For your reference , the pass described in the video later in this article uses this concept very effectively . <h> 5 . Isolate a Leg <p> Dealing with one of your opponents legs is literally twice as easy as dealing with both of them . One of the first steps in the majority of the passes I teach is to choose a side you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . <p> Another way of thinking about this : Try to- always have one of your opponents legs between both of yours . You do n't  want both of his legs around yours , or both inside yours . <p> Again , - pass detailed in the video later in the article is a great example of this principle in action . <h> 6 . Choose Speed or Tightness <p> Guard passes can be broadly categorised into two different classes : Speed and Tightness . <p> Speed passes use and are reliant on high levels of athleticism and attributes- like quickness- and agility . They usually employ rapid direction changes and or acrobatics to accomplish the passage . They often require less energy than tightness-based passes but they are also usually lower-percentage , and I 've found that they do n't  work that well against higher-level opposition . Examples of this type are the cartwheel pass and the torreando pass . <p> Tightness passes are much more methodical and usually have more technical steps . They often require a large amount of upper-body and grip strength and rely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts . <p> here 's an example of a pass that uses tightness as opposed to speed : <p> When passing the guard , you need to choose one or the other . If one type does n't  work against a particular player its very likely that the other will . I 've had quite a bit of success with this . When I encounter a tricky open-guard specialist with very dynamic hips and feel that my speed-based passes are ineffective , I immediately change to a tightness-based pass and use it to shut him down . <h> 7 . Do n't  Forget Submissions <p> Although I do n't  suggest you build your guard-passing strategy around submissions , I also feel that its not wise to disregard them entirely . <p> From within the closed guard , using certain submission attacks can force a reaction and get the opponent to uncross his ankles and allow you to begin your pass . The two subs I 've had some success doing this with are the thrusting choke ( potato smasher ) and the Ezekiel choke . <p> Lower-body submissions can also be great options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed very powerful attacks like the Estima-lock , which can devastating even expert guard players when used properly . Just keep in mind that attempting a foot or leg-lock invariably gives up the top position and can- give your opponent opportunities to counter with similar attacks . Make sure you have a contingency plan and that your scrambling ability is good . <p> Have any other concepts that have helped you with guard passing ?

@@60348861 @348861/ <h> Using the Kimura to Sweep , Control and Submit <p> When I first learned the Kimura , over- 15- years ago , it was as a simple jiu jitsu submission- from the closed-guard . <p> As my journey into the art has progressed and my understanding increased , I have found it fascinating to discover that there is really so much more to this powerful hold . <p> This attack might just be the jiu jitsu move with more names than any other .

@@60348862 @348862/ <h> 1 . You Train Too Little <p> It may sound obvious , but you 'd be amazed how many jiu jitsu guys train 1-2 times per week and then wonder why they 're not getting any better . <p> It 's my belief that training once per week is almost a complete waste of time . A seven day gap between sessions is way too long . Sure , you may be taught ( or discover ) something great in class , but by the time the next lesson rolls around , if you have n't had at least one chance to revise and reinforce it in your memory , you 'll most likely forget it . <p> Twice per week is enough ( barely ) for maintenance of your current skills but it will be hard to get much better. - It 's my current perspective that three times per week is the absolute minimum for decent progress , and- I have found that four sessions per week is the sweet spot between too little and too much . <p> But this is different for everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pharmacist and who- does nothing else but train and sleep might be able to push that to 12 sessions . A 50 year old with a stressful job and family might find even 4 tough classes too much for him . It 's up to you to figure this out by feeling what works for you . <h> 2 . You Train Too Much <p> Ok so it 's pretty unlikely that this is an issue for you , but it does happen . As is the case with many aspects of western society , our community often suffers from the more is better ' mentality . <p> We tend to think things like Well if training 4 times per week is good , then training 8 times per week will be twice as good ! ' . It just does n't work like this . <p> You have a limited ability to recover and if you exceed that ability , becoming overtrained is a very likely outcome . <p> And it 's not just the number of training sessions you have per week , it 's also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buddy is not the same as attending your academy 's competition sparring class . <p> Again , it 's entirely up to you to figure out where the line between too much and too little training is , and how to walk that line . <h> 3 . Your Coach Sucks <p> For the vast majority of the people reading this is not an issue . Most jiu jitsu coaches are committed and passionate teachers , and your lack of progress is something you should take personal responsibility for . But in a few rare cases a crappy instructor could be what 's slowing your development . <p> Your coach may be an amazing competitor , but if his idea of teaching is to show a couple of moves and then sit against the wall playing on his phone while the students bumble through them , then he 's a lousy instructor . <p> Teaching jiu jitsu is an active endeavour . A good coach demonstrates and corrects . A great coach demonstrates , corrects and motivates . <p> If you 're wondering whether or not your coach is hindering your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following questions : <p> When was the last time he sparred with you ? <p> When was the last time he gave you some individual attention and gave you actionable advice on how to improve ? <p> How often does he come over and correct your form while you are drilling ? <p> How committed does he seem to the progress of you and your teammates ? <h> 4 . You 're Not Conditioned <p> If you 're weak and inflexible with no stamina , you can learn all the fancy jiu jitsu techniques and concepts in the world , but they 're not going to help much . <p> Well-conditioned athletes learn faster , recover more quickly and are less likely to get injured . So stop making excuses as to why you ca n't swing a kettlebell or do some laps in the pool and get fit for the sake of your jiu jitsu. <h> 5 . You Have No Plan <p> Jiu jitsu is just like so many other areas of life without goals you become directionless . If you 're fit and have a great coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per week and you will definitely improve . But if you have a plan , you 'll improve much , much faster . <p> I suggest that every couple of months you- run a detailed analysis of your game and figure out the areas that you need to focus on . <p> For example , last week I took an objective look at my game and realised that my half-guard is really not working the way I want it to . Now when I head to training I have a couple of concepts and techniques from that position that I- focus on . When it comes to the sparring part of the class I actively seek out half-guard- and practice them . In a couple of months I 'll reassess and potentially focus on something else . <h> 6 . You 're Bored <p> I definitely do not believe that you need to be constantly trying new stuff . Most jiu jitsu guys collect far too many techniques and never practice anything to enough depth of understanding and ability . <p> But at the same time , many of us get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . Or we do n't push ourselves enough . This can be characterised by not seeking out tougher training partners , or avoiding the challenge of competing . <p> So after the 100th time you 've used the scissor-sweep on a white belt at your gym , you start to become bored . You then lose energy and desire to train and your game stagnates . <p> No matter what your belt or level of ability , there is always room for growth in jiu jitsu . There are so many new and interesting techniques , training methods and perspectives that boredom should never be an issue for long but it 's your job to keep searching and growing . <h> 7 . You Have n't Zoomed Out <p> I 'm sure you 've experienced this before . You tap out to a lower belt during a sparring match , or you get beaten in a comp and then suddenly you feel that your whole game has gone to shit . <p> You could be feeling this way because you 're too zoomed in . <p> You think your- progress should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jitsu progress happens a lot more like this : <p> You could think that you 're jits is not getting better but just be on one of the flat parts of the curve . <p> Your performance in the sparring segment of class is not a good yardstick . Think about it : if your coach is doing his job , and your classmates are all training as hard as you are , you 're all going to be getting better . This means that the guy who could beat you last month will still be better than you next month ! <p> Here 's my favorite exercise for zooming back out and getting a more accurate idea of my progress : <p> Each year on your birthday , ask yourself Could the me of today beat the me of a year ago ?

Without thinking twice , he replied the mount ' . <p> Until I reached the brown belt level , I used to believe that the mount was overrated . So much so , that once I had secured it and scored the 4 points I used to just leave it by switching to side-control . <p> But after seeing Rogers success with it - and studying it intensively for several years , I finally began to understand just how effective it could be . <p> Here are seven of most important details which have helped improve my ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't have good balance , the mount position is practically useless to you . It 's next to impossible to set-up an attack when you 're just trying to avoid be rolled off . This balance has to be instinctive it 's not something you want to have to think about because your focus should instead be on your attacks . <p> There 's a drill I use that can really help with this . Establish the mount position on a training partner and have him place his hands behind his head , while you do the same . Then have him try to buck you off while you attempt to maintain your balance . Once this becomes easy , the next progression of the drill is to have your eyes closed while doing it . <p> This will teach you the timing and sensitivity required to hold the mount without using your hands , which can then be freed up to start working your chokes and armlocks. <h> 2 . Foot Positioning <p> This simple little tip from my teacher Roger Gracie really reduced the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs into half-guard . When you are in the classic mount position , make sure your feet are constantly tucking under ' into your training partner 's body . Any room between your feet and his body is a potential opportunity for him to trap one of your ankles and allow him to start his re-guard proces , and we all know how frustrating that can be . <p> The Fundamentals of BJJ , including The Mount , are covered in The BJJ Building Blocks course by Roger Gracie Black Belt Nicolas Gregroriades <h> 3 . Hip Flexibility <p> There is a common misconception that squeezing your opponent tightly between your knees while holding the mount position is the most effective way to control them in the mount . It 's been my experience that the best mount-specialists do exactly the opposite . <p> While keeping their feet tucked , they widen their knees and sink ' their hips into the other fighter . This greatly improves their balance because it both broadens their base and lowers their center of gravity . It also puts far more pressure on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have Red and Black belt Mauricio Gomes holding you in mount you 'll understand exactly what I mean . ) <p> The only way to allow yourself to sink low enough to apply this kind of pressure is by having a certain amount of flexibility in your hips . If you do n't yet have it , it 's time to start stretching more . ( hint : do yoga ! ) <h> 4 . Understand the Different Types <p> The main variations of mount you will work with are : <p> Low Mount in which you are almost lying flat , with your legs grapevined ' around your opponent . The low mount is good for control because it allows you to drive down into your opponent 's hips with yours , completely nullifying his bridge . It 's quite limited when it comes to submissions though . <p> Technical Mount this is usually used as a counter to the most common mount defense , the elbow-knee escape , allowing you to maintain a reasonably good attacking position when your opponent has made it onto his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the variations , the ideal high mount has you sitting up , right over your opponent 's sternum , with your knees forcing his arms far away from his mid-section . <p> It 's best to choose one of the mounts and not spend too much time in no man 's land ' ( i.e. sitting over your opponent 's stomach , between high and low mounts ) <p> Also , as a general rule you should be trying to work your way towards a high mount as it has the most attack options available . <h> 5 . Chain High ' &amp; Low ' Attacks <p> Athough there are many submissions from the mount , the three bread and butter ' are : the straight armlock , the cross-choke , with the Ezekiel-Choke . <p> Now if a smart jiu jitsu guy finds himself defending the mount he will be trying to do two things matter what : <p> 1 .

Keep his elbows close to his center <p> But here 's the thing he can only do one of those properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both hands , but then his elbows will start to flare exposing him to armlocks . Or he could keep his elbows glued in at his sides , in which case his hands invariably move away from his neck , meaning he 's vulnerable to chokes . Knowing this , you can keep combining the armlock and choke attacks until he gives you an opening , making you far more dangerous from the position . <h> 6 . Keep His Shoulders on the Mat <p> Almost every escape from the mount necessitates that the person defending will have to lift one or both of his shoulders from the mat , because he will either need to sit up or turn to his side . <p> Knowing this , we can adopt a wrestler 's mentality when attacking and try to pin both of his shoulder 's to the mat at all times . This will make escaping much more difficult and give you more time to move to high mount and set up your subs . <h> 7 . Know When to Transition <p> Sometimes , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount , a strong opponent will be able to power out . There is a point of no return ' at which there is no use trying to fight his escape ( whether it be a bridge , or a shrimp etc ) because he 's gone far enough to have gained sufficient leverage . <p> If you can identify this point and your timing is good , you need to make the tactical decision of giving up the mount and transitioning to side mount or the back . <p> This is especially important for smaller fighters , who may have difficulties holding bigger players down due to the weight differential . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60348870 @348870/ <h> Jiu Jitsu and MMA Workouts Which Should You Choose ? <p> One of the questions I am often asked at seminars is " What are good- Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and MMA workouts ? " In an earlier post , I spoke of " attribute maximization " . This article will discuss specific ways to condition and prepare the body for jiu-jitsu . <p> I believe that the most important question you need to ask yourself when doing any training to improve your grappling is " Why am I doing this ? " . For example , let 's say you are doing a session consisting of jumping jacks , sprints and pull ups . Why are you doing those exercises ? How will the they aid you , specifically , on the mat . If you cant answer that question about your workouts or even each specific exercise , then you need to reevaluate what you 're doing . Below I give a general overview of the exercises I engage in and , more importantly , why I use them . <p> Climbing <p> At this point , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The improvement in grip strength alone is worth the effort . After about 6 months of rock-climbing once per week I noticed a major increase in my forearm and finger strength . <p> A study on bone density between two control groups , one of weightlifters and one of rock climbers , found that the climbers had far higher levels of bone density . Obviously , increased bone density is invaluable to a jiu-jitsoka . <p> Swimming is great for jiu-jitsu . In my opinion its far superior to running as a form of conditioning because there is no impact on the ankles , knees and hips . It lengthens and strengthens the muscles and opens up the back and shoulders areas of the body which often tighten up after a lot of grappling . <p> Its also excellent for breath control- and strengthens the heart and lungs . It promotes rhythm and , when done at a slow pace , will help with over-training and recovery . <p> Best for : Cardiovascular Fitness <p> Resistance Training with Equipment <p> The beauty of using equipment is that is allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I use weights and kettlebells I tend to focus on compound , multi-joint movements such as full squats , barbell rows and Turkish get-ups .

At the more challenging end of the spectrum , gymnastic style movements such as handstands and bridging develop pretty much every attribute . The animals drills are also great for co-ordination and agility . <p> At the moment I am working with unilateral movements such as pistol squats and one-arm push-ups because I feel they offer the superior functional strength for jiu-jitsu . <p> Best for : Agility , Core Strength <p> Yoga <p> Yoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@60348871 @348871/ <h> Nutrition for Jiu-Jitsu <p> Over the past several years I have made a reasonably in-depth examination of nutrition for jiu-jitsu and its effect on my training. , using my body and my jiu-jitsu as a case study . Several years ago , after a couple of conversations with the black-belt Marc Walder , I began to take my nutrition even more seriously . Below I will attempt to outline what I have experienced and discovered . I am not claiming it is absolute truth , only a truth that resonates with me . You do not have to believe anything I say . Research it for yourself , and more importantly , test it subjectively . <h> Eliminate Sugar <p> According to many nutritional experts , sugar is one of the main causes of inflammation in the human body . It does n't  take much intelligence to realize that inflammation is a jiu-jitsoka 's enemy . Hard training itself leads to inflammation which requires requires plenty of rest , so adding a dietary cause of inflammation is unwise . Note that sugar takes many , many forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are just forms of sugar : Glucose , Glucose Syrup , Fructose , High Fructose Corn Syrup , Invert Sugar , Dextrose , Maltodextrin and Sucrose . <p> Rener &amp; Ryron of the Gracie family understands the importance of quality nutrition for jiu jitsu <h> Limit Meat Consumption <p> Although I am almost completely vegetarian , I do believe that a moderate amount of meat has its place in a fighters diet . Most westerners however , plan their diets around meat , chicken and fish . Meat is quite taxing on the stomach , requiring a lot of energy to digest . This is energy that could be used for training and recovery . Also , most meat available today is a far-cry from the food that our ancestors were eating . It is derived from animals that have been mistreated and injected with various drugs , all of which indirectly enter the system of whoever consumes it and can cause negative effects . If you eat meat , try to limit the amounts , and ensure it is of high quality , preferably from free-range , grass-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief , you do not need dairy products for calcium . This is a fallacy perpetuated by the dairy industry . Many studies have shown that the calcium in dairy products actually leeches calcium from the bones , causing them to become brittle . Evidence of this is the relatively low incidence of osteoporosis in nations with minimal dairy consumption . As a jiu-jitsu practitioner , the strength of your skeletal structure is paramount , so eating something that may weaken it is counter-productive . Dairy products are also extremely acid-forming in the body . An overly acidic body is prone to rapid muscular fatigue , which I am sure you will agree is not something you want during your jiu-jitsu career . If you do consume dairy products , again , ensure that they are minimally processed and preferably unpasteurised . <h> Eliminate Gluten <p> Gluten is a protein found in modern strains of wheat , and more and more research is showing that it is detrimental to the human body . I have found that when I eliminate it from my diet , I lose fat and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stomach bloating and sometimes even skin rashes . Everyone 's tolerance to it is different , but it in my mind it is unequivocally detrimental to jiu jitsu fighters . <h> Avoid Large Meals <p> Rickson Gracie once said that the biggest workout your body does on a daily basis is digestion . It logical to assume that the larger the portion of food you consume , the greater the tax on your system . This is why we usually become sleepy after a big meal . The less food you have in your system , the more of your resources can be devoted to training . <h> Avoid Processed Food Products and Preservatives <p> The body is an organism which functions most efficiently on nutrients derived from food consumed in its natural state . Candy , soda , crackers , meal replacement bars , breakfast cereals and the like are not food , they are food products . They are very often devoid of nutritional value and do little to satisfy hunger or the requirements of the body . This is why you can eat 15 cookies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and eat food that has undergone little or no processing . An apple is far superior to apple fruit roll-up . Freshly squeezed orange juice is better than the pasteurized , bottled version , and a whole orange is better yet . Avoid anything with chemical names on the label . These substances are toxic to the body and will hold you back as a fighter . <h> Maximise Fruit and Vegetables Intake <p> Raw or lightly cooked fruit and vegetables are quickly and easily digested , provide large amount of energy , and contain high quantities of bio-available nutrients . The more raw , plant matter in your diet , the better you will feel , and the faster you will recover . My research has led me to believe that leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale , as well as those of the cruciferous variety like broccoli and cauliflower are the most beneficial to overall health . <h> Eat Nuts and Seeds ( in moderation ) <p> Raw , unsalted nuts provide an excellent source of protein . The most nutritious are Brazil nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cashews . Be careful not to overdo it though , as excessive intake of nuts can make you feel sluggish . Also , all nuts and seed should be soaked/sprouted before consumption , as this removes the anti-nutrient coating . <h> Fresh Squeeze/Blend Your Juices <p> If you are going to drink anything besides water , try to make it freshly squeezed juice . The stuff you buy in a supermarket is not freshly squeezed juice . 99% of all boxed and bottled juice has been pasteurized at least once . This means it has been heated to a very high temperature , which destroys almost all of the vitamin and mineral content and renders it close to sugar-water in nutritional value . Also , once juice is squeezed it oxidizes very quickly , so its best to consume it immediately . Invest in a juicer or preferably a blender a glass of fresh juice before a training session will provide energy and a glass afterwards will replenish it . Blending is preferable where possible as it does not remove the finer of the plant , which helps minimise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good site to check out if you want to know more about juicing is Fit-Juice . <h> Try Fasting <p> Most of us eat too much and too often . Our systems are overburdened by all the food and chemicals we subject them to . Fasting gives the body a chance to divert its resources from digestion to healing . If you have the will power to make it through a 24 hour fast , you will be amazed at how good you will feel . If this is too much for you , see if you can skip a couple of meals ever few days by following an intermittent fasting protocol . The trade-off for a little hunger will be increased energy and clarity of mind , two things invaluable to a jiu-jitsoka . <h> In Closing <p> It is not easy to eat a clean , wholesome diet in the modern world . Tasty , yet unhealthy food products are marketed to us at every turn . But the benefits of a a moderate amount of effort and discipline with regards to food far outweigh the sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . Please let me know about your experiences with nutrition and training . At a later stage I will publish an article about the role of supplements in jiu-jitsu. 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60348872 @348872/ <h> 6 Unusual Ways to Improve Your BJJ <p> Once you make the switch in your mindset from that of a hobbyist to a committed martial artist one of the things you 'll understand is that your jiu jitsu training is not limited to the mat . <p> This idea is probably not new to you and by now you 've possibly either considered or even tried some of the off-the-mat activities which many jiu jitsu guys use to improve . These are the usual suspects which include things like weight-lifting , rock-climbing and yoga . <p> But there are several other activities which , although they appear unrelated to BJJ , will make you move and fight better . <p> Not only will they improve your jiu jitsu , but most of them can be also be used as a form of active rest ' to speed up your recovery from hard sparring sessions . <h> Surfing <p> It 's no coincidence that so many elite level black belts are also great surfers. - It 's great for balance and learning how to transfer and load your weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one enter into the flow state a form of consciousness that enhances both learning and memory . Getting used to entering and using this state and then transferring it onto the mat will have obvious benefits for the jiu jitsu player . <p> And not only is the paddling a good workout , it 's also a good antidote for the hunched and contracted posture that years of grappling can create . <p> Note Skateboarding and snowboarding are almost as good but lack the physicality ( and resulting conditioning ) that the paddling of surfing provides . <h> Trampolining <p> I had heard about Randy Couture using trampolines for his UFC fight preparations and always thought I 'd like to try it , but it was n't until I went to a trampolining center recently that I realised what amazing tools these are for grapplers . <p> There are studies which show that using trampolines have many health benefits including improved bone density and circulation as well as enhanced detoxification . It 's a fantastic workout too an hour on the trampoline and you 'll be sweating just as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trampoline park- and try practising solo grappling drills like shooting , sprawling , sit-outs and shrimping on the sprung surfaces . You 'll be surprised at how difficult they are and by how much easier they seem when you get back to a regular mat . <p> Doing back flips and somersaults is also excellent for your spatial awareness and will help with jiu jitsu inversions like the Berimbolo ( Granby ) . They will also help you learn how to relax when being thrown and minimise the chance of injury . <h> Juggling <p> My very first grappling coach is an absolute genius . The guy trained himself to a very high level of grappling skill without any instructors of his own and with very few training resources . He has an amazing instinct and understanding of how the body should move properly in a jiu jitsu context and is always pushing the boundaries of training . Whenever we 're in the same place I make it a priority to see him and learn from him . <p> Last time we got together his new thing was juggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frustrating . I thought it was ridiculous waste of time until I learned that it 's a complex perceptual motor-skill that has many requirements in common with jiu jitsu , including hand-eye coordination , timing and rhythm . <p> I do n't have any proof of it , but I 'm sure that learning training your brain to do something like this improves your ability to learn jiu jitsu . <h> Free-Diving <p> A couple of years ago I did a free-diving course in Thailand and I was really amazed by how many similarities I noticed between it and jiu jitsu , in particular the sparring and competitive aspects of the art . <p> The feelings of mild anxiety and excitement before the dives reminded me of how I feel before a jiu jitsu competition . To be good at free diving you have to learn how to relax your body and calm your mind . If your body is stiff and tense you burn too much oxygen and have to abort your dive early , and if you do n't overcome any fearful thoughts your mind brings up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very similar to BJJ . You 'll never be even a half-way decent grappler unless you learn how to relax your body when you 're under pressure , and you will never excel in competition until you learn how to control your mind . The experience of being several meters underwater without air and overcoming the panic reflex is very , very similar to the experience of being caught in a submission and remaining calm while you look for an escape opportunity . <p> If you 've followed my work for any amount of time you 'll know how big I am becoming aware of your breathing patterns during your jiu jitsu training . Free-diving also facilitates this awareness as you need to master several breathing techniques that need to be used before you submerge . <h> Dancing <p> Ok bear with me <p> The better your mobility , the more jiu jitsu movements you 'll be able to do , the more you 'll tough positions you 'll be able to wriggle free from , and the more you 'll be able to generate leverage against your opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility ? Try dancing freely to some music for a few minutes and moving in as many random directions as possible ( maybe do this in private ) . You will quickly realise just how limited your range- of motion is and where your body is stiff . <p> Dancing is not just good body awareness and mobility and rhythm in certain forms it 's also great for building your attributes . <p> I remember training Geo Martinez at a seminar I taught several years ago , before he was the hot-shot he is today . Even back then I was really impressed with his movement , balance and strength . Then I found out he was an elite-level breakdancer and I was n't surprised at all . <p> Capoeira is especially good for BJJ players . It 's been my experience that students with capoeira experience pick up jiu jitsu quickly and are also very athletic . <h> Slack-Lining <p> Balance is important in all aspects of life , but in functional combat sports it 's absolutely essential . <p> As jiu jitsu guys we need exceptional balance not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against sweeps when passing and reversals when in mounted positions . <p> I 'm a pretty athletic and coordinated guy , and I thought I had good balance until I tried a slack line . There is nothing I have found that will challenge and improve your balance as thoroughly as it does . <p> And it builds huge , functional strength in the core and lower body . Show me a jiu jitsu player who can - perform a full pistol squat on a slack-line and I 'll show you someone very difficult to throw and who has a nightmare guard . <p> As an added bonus , it also helps with injury prevention . If you 've been doing jiu jitsu for a while you 've either hurt your knee or know a training partner who has . It 's a very common injury in our sport . Several studies have found slack-lining enhances functional knee-joint stability <h> Skipping / Jump-Roping <p> Although it 's the least exotic ' activity on this list , jump-roping is also one of the best for your bjj . It 's amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning and grappling game . It is great for timing , coordination , cardiovascular fitness , balance and rhythm . <p> Over the last year I 've come to understand how important the concept of foot-engagement is in jiu jitsu . Because jumping rope is fantastic for strengthening your feet , ankles and calves it really helps with this . Strong feet and toes are able to much more easily engage correctly with the mat and / or your opponent and this will result in better jiu jitsu . <p> It 's not spoken about much but proper footwork is also crucial for stand-up and guard passing technique . Jumping rope regularly builds the fast-twitch muscle fibres in your calves which keeps you light ' on your feet and helps with explosiveness . This means better throws , standing passes and escapes . <h> There are many ways to train <p> If your initial reaction is to think that these more esoteric exercises could n't possibly improve your jiu jitsu as much as a session of hard rolls , you 'd be wrong .

This is a recognisable and set process ' that you have to go through in order to successfully apply your submission . <p> Escapes are no different and my process for approaching any less favourable position is as follows : <p> Frame <p> Create space <p> Move <p> Many times you will be caught in unfamiliar positions but by using this process you will be able to find a way out . The most important thing is to not randomly thrash around but instead to have a set strategy that can be applied in whatever position you have arrived in . There is no point trying to move without having first framed and created space to move in to . <p> Of course , you will also require technical skills in order to initiate the creation of space and to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be able to pull it off your escapes repeatedly , but the application of this strategy will minimize the wasting of energy and reduce your frustration enormously . <p> Do n't be afraid to spend time in bad positions when rolling and use these as opportunities to practice this process and get used to finding the space that you need . <h> Shape <p> When you are trapped underneath your opponent try to make yourself as small as possible and keep your limbs safely drawn in . I can think of very few situations where it would be advantageous to be stretched out into your longest shape on the bottom . <p> If you make a conscious effort to become as compact underneath your opponent as possible , they will find it more difficult to attack and improve their position . It is also far easier to prevent your opponent from connecting with your hips if your knees are bent and drawn in and your elbows are tight into your hip region . <h> Energy Efficient Movement <p> Try to perform each movement as smoothly and effortlessly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more physically taxing it will be and the fewer times you will be able to perform it . Conserve your energy for when you need it the most . <p> When making your frame and escaping , try to imagine your opponent is an immovable object . Create your frame to prevent them from following your escape direction and avoid bad habits like bench-pressing ' your arms into them . <p> If there is space available you should be constantly moving . The more subtle the movement and angles you offer your opponent , the more likely he is to make a mistake or give you space to escape . <h> Relax and Breathe ! <p> Finaly , try to remain as relaxed as possible , opportunities for escaping are much more likely to present themselves when you are in a relaxed state . Aggressively pushing or pulling your opponent will only serve to reveal your intention and expose you to potential submissions . You are also less likely to get injured , will be able to roll for longer periods and will be a better training partner if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys to relaxation and learning to control your breathing in bad positions will help you to remain relaxed and keep your movements smooth . It is not uncommon to see beginners holding their breath on the bottom and this is extremely counterproductive . In a very short period of time the muscles will become deprived of oxygen and even the simplest of movement will become impossible . <p> This article was written by South African Black Belt , Chris Bright , who runs the PE Submission Fighting Academy . <p> - 181481 @qwx591481

@@60348878 @348878/ <h> 8 Jiu Jitsu Fundamentals White Belts Should Know <p> Being relaxed while sparring or competing gives you more access to your skills . <p> How many times have you heard a bjj guy talking about the basics ' ? Everyone says stuff like You 've got to have good basics . ' But what does that mean ? What defines a jiu jitsu technique as basic ? <p> I do n't have the answer to that question , but in this article I have defined 8 basic jiu jitsu moves and fundamental skills that I feel are essential- to the development of a good all-around grappling game . <p> Are these the only basics ' you should know ? Of course not . Another instructor would probably come up with a completely different list . But if you learn and internalize these I guarantee that 'll you 'll be a better fighter . <h> 1 . The Ability to Relax While Training <p> The acquisition of this ability is paramount to your progress in BJJ . If you train without the ability to relax , sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not , injured . Not only that , but training with a super-tense competitive mindset slows your progress down . It 's been proven that people learn fastest when they are relaxed . <p> Now all this is easier said than done . I always have other bjj instructors asking me things like How can I teach my students to relax ? ' <p> It 's been my experience that the primary factor at play when a student is unable to practise in a calm and controlled manner is his or her own ego . <p> Nobody likes tapping out . It 's hell on the ego . The ego wants to dominate and control and to win at all costs . Let me let you in on a little secret : You 're never going to be the best jiu-jitsu fighter in the world . You 're probably never gon na be the best guy in your academy . But so what ? Being the best is a fleeting and painful position to be in . You always have somebody on your ass , trying to take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody better than you comes along . Forget about winning or losing put your focus on learning and developing . It 's a much better long-term strategy , trust me. <h> 2 . Bridging and Shrimping <p> I once heard an interesting analogy which likened grappling to a language , and a sparring match to a conversation . <p> If grappling is a language , then bridging and shrimping can be considered the vowels . They are that crucial . They are two of the most important examples in the collection of movements which sew all your moves together . <p> Flavio Canto , Judo Olympian and BJJ black belt , once said Practise movements , not only moves . ' I now understand his reasoning . Movements are versatile and can be woven into techniques . They give a big bang for your training buck . <p> Now just because you do these drills a few times each during the warm up in class does not mean you are doing them correctly or to anywhere near their potential . I 've been training for almost 12 years and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And keep in mind that there are several variations on each of them . Spend time researching and practising them and I guarantee you 'll see improvements quickly . <h> 3 . Gripping Correctly <p> One of my first coaches , Felipe Sousa , told me early in my grappling career If you ca n't grip then you ca n't fight . ' Wise words indeed . What you need to understand is that effective gripping has three components . <p> The first , is the strength of your hands . Your fingers and hands will naturally become stronger after a couple of years of training , but if you want to turbo charge the process , you will need to seek out supplemental training . There are countless grip-strengthening gadgets and courses on the market , each of which I 'm sure has some value . Do your research . For me , the thing that help most in developing my grip was rock climbing . Try it out and you 'll see a big improvement . <p> The second , is efficient gripping . No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloth using too much strength , your eventually forearms will fatigue and your grip will weaken . You can find out more about how to grip efficiently in this video : <p> And finally , - where to grip is of vital importance . You have the strongest , most efficient gripping technique in the world , but if you 're still holding onto the wrong things you 'll struggle to generate the requisite amount of leverage required to achieve your objectives . Again , check out the video for more detailed information regarding where to grip . <h> 4 . The Standing Guard Pass <p> In my opinion , passing the guard is by far the most difficult aspect of bjj . If a guy has strong legs and active hips , dealing with his guard can be absolute hell . <p> The standing guard pass should really be called the standing guard break ' , because most of the time you 're only standing for the first part , which is breaking ' open his guard where his legs cross on your lower back . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guard from a standing or kneeling position . But either way , to open the guard of an decent jiu-jiteiro you invariably have to stand up . <p> Sure , there are some techniques for breaking open the guard from on your knees , but try them out against someone reasonably tall and with decent leg strength and let me know how that works out for you . <p> For details on the standing guard pass , speak to your instructor . If he 's good he 'll show you the correct technique and variations without insisting that you take a private lesson . <h> 5 . Escaping Side Mount <p> Escapes are not glamorous or crowd-pleasing , but up to at least purple belt they 're the most important aspect of your game . And escaping side mount is the most important part of the defensive aspect to your game . <p> After years of practising , teaching and refining this aspect of bjj , I 've identified three components that I believe are key to getting it right . <p> First , you have to protect your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape move in the world but if you 're getting choked out it 's not going help you . Keep at least one hand in easy reach of your lapels at all times . <p> Second is bridging and shrimping ( sound familiar ? ) . The secret is in learning to perform these moves with the correct timing and combine them . The one ( bridging ) usually precedes the other ( shrimping ) . There are many more details to this which I will cover in a future video or article . <p> Finally , you must learn how to combo the guard replacement ' and go to knees ' escapes . If you know how to do these two well you will have a good chance in 90 percent of all side mount situations . Again , if you want more information , ask your instructor . <h> 6 . Breath control <p> Your ability to learn and perform on the mat is linked to your state of mind , which is in turn linked to your breath . If your breathing is smooth and even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . But if you 're panting and gasping for air , I can assure you that your jits wo n't be effective or cool to watch . <p> Another interesting thing about breath control is that it can also help you deal with the ego . By concentrating on the the flow of your inhalations and exhalations and the movement of your breath through your body , you will be able to largely disassociate from any self-talk that might distract you from your sparring or drilling . <h> 7 . The Straight-Armlock from Guard <p> This is the first submission I teach my private students . Although in application it appears simple , it 's actually a complex technique with many points to it . <p> Learning and memorizing a complex sequence from start to finish is of great benefit for beginner students . I ca n't explain the neuroscience behind it , but it 's been my experience that once they have done this comprehensively for at least one move , learning all subsequent moves becomes easier . <p> In addition to this , understanding the straight-armlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key grappling concepts concepts including grip control . head control , creating angles of attack . and using the - hip/core/glute drive to apply leverage . <p> If you want to see me demonstrate this technique online you can find the video below : <h> 8 . The Scissor Sweep <p> I once heard that Rickson considers the scissor sweep the most important of all . If it 's true I can understand why . The scissor sweep is important because to do it properly you have to incorporate several principles that are vital to most sweeps . <p> Control of the wrist and arm of the side you are sweeping to If you do n't do this , you 'll never complete the sweep in a million years . Overlooking this one detail is the main contributing factor to failed sweeps in my opinion . <p> Powering these sweep using the hips and trunk as opposed to the arms Most of the time , if you 're using your arms to power a movement you 're operating inefficiently . Watch how beginner 's will try to move their opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scissor sweep the kicking of the legs provides all <p> Facilitating the inversion by raising your opponents center of gravity With good scissor-sweeping technique , you use the top leg and lapel-grip to elevate your partner 's hips by pulling him towards you . This raises his center of gravity ( pelvis ) and makes it far easier to flip him over . This is a common element in most sweeps and reversals . <p> For more information on the scissor sweep check out one of the hundreds of youtube instructionals try to identify the principles above while you 're watching them . 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60348879 @348879/ <h> Yoga &amp; Jiu Jitsu : A Natural Symbiosis <p> Because my surname is n't Gracie and I did n't start training when I was five , I 've had to constantly and relentlessly search for supplemental training that will improve my game and allow me catch up with my Brazilian contemporaries . <p> As I mentioned in the- Spirit of Jiu Jitsu , of all the additional systems and methods I 've used to improve my jiu jitsu ability , I consider yoga to be by far the most effective . So much so , that I 've eliminated almost all other supplemental training from my regime . This includes , kettlebell training , olympic lifting , swimming and rock climbing. - I 'm not claiming these are n't great ways to improve your jiu jitsu . I 'm saying that , at this point , I get a far bigger return investing my limited time into the practise of yoga . <h> The Gracie Connection <p> At the very start of my grappling career one of the first videos I watched was Choke ' , the documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the levels of grace , balance and power which Rickson brought to his practice of jiu jitsu . <p> I was also astounded by the physical feats of breath control and balance that he displayed during his training sessions . I later found out that many of these were advanced yoga techniques , and realised that Rickson owed a large portion of his legendary abilities to his yoga prowess . <p> This planted a seed in my mind , and although I did n't take up yoga seriously until several years later , I instinctively knew that there was truth in it . <h> What is Yoga ? <p> Yoga is a commonly used generic term for a collection of physical , mental , and spiritual disciplines which originated in India . It is an extremely complex and diverse system which embraces many different aspects of the human experience . <p> The yoga most commonly practised in the west , which you see in health clubs and studios , is usually some derivative of the physical component of Hatha ' yoga . So we could say that Ashtanga , Iyengar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be familiar with all fall under the umbrella term of Hatha Yoga ' . For the scope of this article we will be referring mainly to Hatha yoga . <p> This aspect of yoga is largely concerned with asanas , which refer to the body positions and physical postures which are held during practise , and vinyasa a specific sequence of breath-synchronised movements used to transition between sustained asanas . <h> How Will it Help My Jiu Jitsu ? <p> It almost seems as if the arts of jiu jitsu and yoga were designed to complement each other . There are so many similarities and mirrored truths between the two of them . It 's not surprising that they both have roots which are entwined with buddhism and ancient india . <p> Besides having been proven to alleviate depression , high blood-pressure and a host of other physical ailments , yoga will also help your bjj is many specific ways , several of which I have outlined below : <h> Correction of Imbalances <p> Jiu jitsu often causes poor posture and and skeletomuscular imbalances . <p> There 's an acronym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands . It refers to the observation that the body will quite rapidly become adapted to the positions or activities it encounters most often . One of the most commonly imposed demands ' of jiu-jitsu is contraction . When you 're in guard , attacking from the side mount , back and many of the other positions , your body is in a contracted state . <p> The upper back is often rounded as you are holding onto your opponent , the hip flexors and psoas are usually tightened because the knees are tucked up towards the chest , and as for the neck and shoulders well if you 've been training for any length of time you 'll know exactly what I 'm talking about.This excessive contraction is even more pronounced in the primary defensive postures , like the turtle position . ( Interestingly , the ageing process is also characterised by contraction this is why old people start to hunch over . ) <p> Regular practise of the various asanas and vinyasas is the best remedy I 've found for this imbalanced state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . As an added bonus , many of your submissions will also improve . Consider that many of the finishes in jiu-jitsu require an exaggerated expansion out from the center ( Think of a straight armbar for example -you arch your back and drive your hips forwards to apply leverage ) . Very often your effectiveness with these movements is hampered by the imbalances mentioned previously , and you can see how addressing them with yoga will allow you to generate more power . <h> Improved Flexibility <p> I 've never been a particularly flexible individual . I 've always looked at the more supple jiu jitsu practitioners with equal parts of both awe and envy . We all know that guy who can wrap his legs around your waist from the bottom of mount and sweep you off there 's one in every academy . <p> About three years ago , when I turned 30 I made a promise to myself that I would do whatever it took to become a flexible person . I investigated several stretching methods and found that few of them increased my flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get away without being flexible in jiu jitsu , it 's an attribute that 's unquestionably beneficial . The greater the range of motion in your joints , the more options you will have in each position . In fact , some parts of jiu jitsu will be completely inaccessible to you until you develop the required suppleness , the rubber guard being a good example . <h> Increased Strength and Balance <p> The kind of strength developed through yoga practise is unlike anything else I 've experienced . Over the past couple of decades the phrase core strength ' has become a popular in sports training but yoga goes beyond that . <p> Diligent practise develops what I call intelligent strength . Not only does it train the central nervous system to fire muscles in the correct sequence , it also teaches you which muscles to engage to to maintain postural alignment and efficiently move your anatomy through space . And we all know that good posture and moving efficiently are hallmarks of superior jiu jitsu . <p> Also , holding the asanas develops an muscular endurance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chokes and strangles. - And although it tones and strengthens , yoga does not produce excessive muscle hypertrophy . Too much muscle mass is not good for jiu jitsu because it burns oxygen quickly and inhibits movement . Consistent practise ( combined with good diet ) will reset your body to its optimum tissue composition . <p> My first coach used to say One of the best things a fighter can have is balance ' . Over the years I came to understand just how true that was.Yoga is exceptional for developing balance . Many of the standing asanas are done unilaterally ( on one leg ) , which not only improves stability but sport-specific strength as well.I 've seen professional athletes challenged by the most simple of these postures . Mastering them will massively improve your top game by making you far harder to sweep . It 'll also improve throws and takedowns . <h> Body Awareness and Breath Control <p> Your body is the tool with which you create your jiu-jitsu , and the more you know about it and more effectively you can operate it the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body awareness gained from yoga practise can not overstated . <p> One of the most valuable ways this is achieved is through breath control . Not only will the vinyasas teach you to coordinate your movement and breathing , but yogic techniques such as pranayama will enable you to engage your diaphragm and utilise your lungs to their full capacity . This will greatly improve your stamina during rolling . <h> Polishing the Mind <p> Some of the more challenging asanas require immense concentration , and sychronizing the movement and breathing during vinyanasa cultivates a certain focus and stillness of the mind which is invaluable during the heat of a a difficult sparring match. - I 've also noticed that memorising the sanskrit names of the various asanas as well as their correct alignments has much overlap with learning bjj techniques . <h> Where Do I Start ? <p> Now I know that some of you are thinking I 'm too old to start ' . I understand the sentiment . I felt the same way about BJJ when I started at 19 years old . But there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 20 years ago , the second best time is now ' . <p> Take the risk , move out of your comfort zone and try a yoga class . I personally do not recommend training on your own using books or videos , unless you already have high levels of body awareness and are very experienced with physical disciplines . Yoga can be dangerous if practised incorrectly and you 're better off utilising an instructor , especially as a beginner . <p> There are countless different types of yoga class available but the main ones you 'll encounter are : <p> Iyengar This style focuses on the physical alignment of the body in the various asanas . It often uses various supports or props ' to fascilitate the poses for beginners and the less flexible . It has very little vinyasa between postures . <p> Vinyasa Vinyasa yoga , in which movement is coordinated to the breath , is a term that covers a broad range of yoga classes . This style is sometimes also called flow yoga , because of the smooth way that the poses run together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinyasa classes some of the most challenging . . I like the fact that each class is usually quite different , and that the pace and intensity closely approximate jiu jitsu . <p> Best for : muscular endurance , dynamic flexibility . <p> Ashtanga This is a form of Vinyasa which is characterised by a much more regimented sequence of asanas and vinyasas , so much so that every class you do will be almost exactly the same . It 's very effective but some people become bored by the lack of variety . <p> It uses a very specific form of yogic breathing called ujjayi ' which has good application for bjj . <p> Best for : breath control , co-oridination , memory <p> Bikram / Hot Yoga <p> The main differentiating factor of bikram is that it is done in a heated room . this ( and - other styles of hot yoga ' have become very popular as of late . due to the heat and humidity , bikram can be a little extreme , and i would n't recommend it for anyone in poor shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , i think that the discomfort caused by the humidity might be good for developing mental strength that could transfer well to bjj . <p> Best for : focus , fat-loss <h> What to Be Aware of <p> Just as there are poor jiu-jitsu instructors , so too are there third-rate yoga teachers . Overly commercial yoga schools should also be avoided . Try several different types of classes and instructors . You will instinctively know which is most beneficial to you . <p> Be aware of the tendency to push yourself too hard during classes . This is common for jiu jitsu guys , who usually adopt the harder , strong , faster ' approach to training . Yoga does n't work that way . Intensity is good , but pain is not . Remember , the path of the yogi is the same as that of the jiu-jitsoka ; it 's a life-long journey and there is no rush . <p> I 'm certain that diligent and consistent practise of yoga will make you a better grappler , and a happier , healthier human being .

@@60348884 @348884/ <h> Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competitions : Tips for First-Timers <p> I remember entering- my- first Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions almost 20 years ago . The fear and anxiety almost completely consumed me . Amazingly , despite horrible performances , I managed to win some of my matches through brute strength and sheer will . What I noticed was that all the training I had done and all the techniques I had learned up until that point went out the window the moment the fights began . My fear , anxiety and anger had come between me and modest amount of technical knowledge I had acquired . <p> Over the years , although I have managed to gain some control over my emotions prior to competitions , and hence I have greater access to my techniques and skills , the fear and anxiety are always there and they always will be . But my degree of control over them continues you grow , and they become more manageable . This only comes with experience however.I always urge the beginners at our academy to enter upcoming competitions . The sense of achievement gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimation , 1 minute of competition is equivalent to approximately 30 to 40mins of regular sparring/mat time with regard to the expansion of self-awareness it allows.Below are some tips and insights that I have found to have helped me gain the most from my competition experiences : <h> You Will Never Be 100% Ready <p> If you wait until you are 100% ready before competing , then you will never compete . You can always be fitter , more technical or more composed . Feeling follows action not the other way around . It is never as hard as it is the first time . You will be nervous , you will will be scared and you will doubt yourself before your first competition . But I can promise you that you will grow more than you ever have during regular classes and lessons . <h> Know and Understand the Rules <p> The rules of jiu jitsu competitions are actually quite complex and can very greatly between the various governing bodies and- events . Its up to you to make sure you know them . Not only will this ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight or illegal moves , it will also allow you to use them to your advantage . Check out our full video guide on the rules here . <h> Make Sure Youre Well-Rested <p> The last week to ten days of before a competition should see you tapering down the scale and frequency of your training . Physically , your muscles , tendons , joints and ligaments will appreciate the break and will be fresh for the contest . Your central nervous system will also benefit too much competitive training in the final days before an event and you will find that your reactions will be slower than usual and your game will be stagnant . In athletics there is a saying " Do not leave your best performance on the practice track " and the same can be said for grappling . <h> Do n't  Make Excuses Beforehand <p> He who makes an excuse before a fight is going to need it . Do n't  be one of those guys who tells all his friends and teammates that he has n't  trained properly , is underweight or recovering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases should you lose . This is an unsporting and undignified practice . If you do n't  feel up to the standard of the event you are participating in but choose to compete anyway , then you must face the consequences . <h> Get to Know the Venue if Possible <p> Although this is not always possible , if you can try to inspect the venue the day before the competition . This will greatly diminish your nervousness on the day because it will be a place you have become familiar with as opposed to something foreign and intimidating . <h> Conserve Your Energy <p> On the day of the event your should be aiming to expend as little energy as possible . Try to remain off your feet . Most of the time you should be spent sitting , or even better , lying down . Try to avoid viewing the matches prior to yours , unless you are watching your potential opponents and formulating your strategy . Watching your teammates compete and screaming advice to them is almost as draining as competing itself . <h> Regulate Your Breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enter the venue ( and perhaps even before ) your body begins its release of adrenalin . Although adrenalin has many benefits for the fighter one of the disadvantages is that it causes your breathing to become shallow . This robs your organs and tissues of much needed oxygen and hence leads to fatigue . By concentrating and ensuring your breathing is deep and rhythmic you not only negate this effect but also help still your mind and alleviate much of the pre-match anxiety . <h> Let Go of the Outcome <p> Do not be focused solely on winning , nor afraid to lose . These are both outcomes . All fighters , even the greats , lose at some point . There is just too much of a random element in grappling / BJJ competition to allow anyone to achieve a 100% win rate . Try instead , to focus on the process . If you learn something from your competition experience , then win or lose , you have have gained .

I have been guilty of this in the past and I will never allow it to happen again . When asked about the match always say " he beat me fair and square " regardless of whether or not you performed your best or you feel that the referee robbed you etc . By the same token , should you be fortunate enough to win , make sure you acknowledge your opponents skill and heart . <p> I look forward to hearing your experiences and insights . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60348887 @348887/ <h> A Brief History of Jiu-Jitsu <h> Japanese Jiu-Jitsu <p> Although its origins can arguably be traced to Buddhist monks of India , Jiu-Jitsu ( sometimes referred to as Ju-Jitsu ' ) in its modern form comes from Japan . <p> Jiu-Jitsu was the battlefield art of the Samurai of Japan. - These samurai warriors were well-armoured and usually on horseback and the art of Jiu-Jitsu was essentially developed to allow the samurai to fight effectively in the event that they found themselves disarmed and on foot . <p> Because of the restricted mobility and agility associated with fighting in armour , jiu-jitsu evolved to include throwing , joint-locks and strangles , in addition to striking moves found in other martial arts . <h> Judo <p> By the mid-1800 's Jiu-jitsu had fractured into several styles or ryu ' . Although the techniques varied from style to style , they all generally incorporated most aspects of hand to hand combat including strikes , grappling and weapon-based attacks and disarms . <p> In the 1880 's , a stand-out young jiu-jitsu , Jigoro Kano , developed his own ryu which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting and skilled opponents . This was a complete deviation from the partner practise that was prevalent at the time . Kano 's style later evolved into Judo , which became one of the most widely practised sports in the world . <h> The Gracie Family <p> A student of Kano 's , Mitsuo Maeda ( also known as Count Koma Count of Combat ' ) emigrated from Japan to Brazil in 1914 . He was assisted by a local politician named George Gracie , whose father had also been an immigrant , hailing originally from Scotland . As a token of his gratitude , Maeda taught jiu-jitsu to George 's son Carlos Gracie . Carlos later shared his knowledge with some of his brothers , with whom he opened Brazil 's first jiu-jitsu academy in 1925 . <p> Over the years , the Gracies ' ( notably Carlos and Helio ) and their students refined their art through brutal no-rules fights , both in public challenge matches and on the street .

Rorion and Art Davies conceived of an event called The Ultimate Fighting Championship ' ( UFC ) , which would pit various martial arts styles against each other .

@@60348900 @348900/ <h> 8 Tips to Instantly Improve Your Guard <p> The guard is the defining position of the gentle art , and without a solid understanding of it you can not consider yourself a proficient jiu jiteiro . Here are several tips that I 've picked up over the years that have helped my bottom game immensely . If you internalize your understanding of them they are guaranteed to improve your guard too . <h> 1 . Live Hips <p> Although your grips and and upper-body play a role in the bottom game , your guard is ultimately powered by your lower-body . With most sweeps and submissions , power is almost exclusively generated and applied through your hips and legs . Here 's a good drill to help you understand this : <p> Have a training partner sit in your closed guard , and get him to interlace both of his hands behind his neck . Do the same yourself . Now try to flip him using a basic scissor sweep . Unless you can take him over cleanly , you are not efficiently applying the power through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different planes as possible and practise them by using drills . Two basic examples include the bridge and the shrimp , but there are several others available . <h> 2 . Learn to Identify &amp; Use Angles <p> Like other functional martial arts , in jiu jitsu you usually require angles to apply leverage . There is nowhere that this is more evident than in guard position . There are several different ways these angles can be used , whether it be the angle of your hips to the floor ( see above ) , or the angle between your hips and your opponent 's hips , or the angle of your torso to your opponent 's torso . <p> Most of the time I 'm looking for 90 degree angles , but as of late I 've found that 45 degree angles work well too . You can see a details on this video- I released on this several years ago- it 's a little dated and since then I 've - begun to understand the concept better I will be releasing a new video on it soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elbow <p> If you 're going to sweep somebody laterally you need to take his hand , wrist and elbow on the side you are sweeping to out of the equation . Having taught , trained and watched thousands of hours of jiu-jitsu , it 's my current perspective that neglecting to do this is the cause of more failed sweeps than anything else . <p> Think about it : when you trip or fall over , the first thing you do is stick your hand out to brace yourself . It 's the exact same with a sweep . The hand and arm is the most dexterous part of your opponent 's anatomy and the first thing he will use to stop himself from being toppled . The cool thing about training in the gi is that it 's far easier to tie up his arm and prevent him from doing this , thus improving your chances of completing your sweep . <h> 4 . Keep Your Opponent 's Posture Broken <p> A good opponent will always try to engage good posture before passing the guard . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other means ) without it will usually result in him being tipped forward , swept or submitted . So by not allowing your sparring partner to get his posture , you will always be one step ahead . This means that you can be proactive with your attacks ( especially with trapping and binding attack patterns like rubber guard ) instead of having to first put out the fires ' of his passage attempts . <h> 5 . Do n't Allow Him to Grip <p> High-Level opponents will also never move without first setting grips , especially in guard . Why ? Because if he does n't have grips , he can not maintain good posture and can not control your torso or hips . This is similar to the tip above in that if you do n't allow him to grip ( and even better , engage strong grips of your own ) , you keep him on the back foot and are more likely to be able to impose your will with a submission or sweep attempt . <h> 6 . Misdirection <p> This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught me when I was eight years old and it works like magic in bjj , especially the guard . If you want to sweep your opponent in one direction , start to off-balance him in the opposite direction . This often results in him overcompensating his weight towards the direction you want to tip him , making the subsequent sweep much easier . This tip works especially well with the Xande sweep shown below : <h> 7 . Utilize the centre-line concept <p> Imagine a line running down from the top of your opponent 's head to floor , bisecting his body into left and right halves . This is the center-line ' . When playing guard , if you can get one of your opponent 's arms all the way across this center-line he becomes very vulnerable to not only the back-take but also several different armbars and sweeps . There are different methods to getting the arm across , but most of them rely on a ) using both of your arms against the one of his and b ) shifting your hips to the same side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see this concept in action below : <h> 8 . Topple the Head ' <p> We spoke of disrupting your opponent 's posture earlier in the article . This concept is similar in that it also usually results in compromising his posture , but it 's more concerned with breaking his balance . <p> Picture your opponent sitting upright in your guard with good posture . - Think of his head as a ball bobbing on the top of spout of water . Your objective should be to try and knock the ball off of the spout . If you can do this , you will completely break his balance , priming him for a sweep or submission . There are many ways to do this , whether it be pushing into his neck with your wrist/forearm , reaping the behind his armpit with the back of your knee or tugging him forward from a lapel grip . Anything you can do to move his head off of this central pillar ' is going to make his life more difficult and yours easier . 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60348901 @348901/ <h> How to Teach Jiu Jitsu <p> Over the past couple of years teaching Jiu Jitsu has become something that I love and look forward to and I am always looking for methods and systems to improve my ability to transmit knowledge to my students . <p> Although I am relatively new to teaching Jiu Jitsu I have been involved in the teaching of medical students and doctors in my other life as an Emergency Physician since 2001 . <p> Very early on as a student of Jiu Jitsu I noticed that there were many parallels between the way in which my instructors passed on the highly technical skills required in Jiu Jitsu and the way- in which I taught a very different , but equally technical skill set to medical personnel . One of the principal similarities was the structure with which a good teacher approached the class . <h> Plan Your Class <p> The army have a saying that proper planning and preparation prevents piss poor performance ' . It has become abundantly clear to me during my time as both a student and a teacher that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , how exactly can a teacher plan and prepare for his classes in order to maximise the learning potential of his students ? <p> There are many different ways of doing this , but in my opinion dividing your planned teaching into three parts , the set , the dialogue and closure , is an excellent method . This is the framework that was taught to me when I embarked on my journey as a medical educationalist and it is one that I return to time and time again . <h> The Set <p> The set is the theatre within which you teach . It is the stage , the props you use and the environment around you . All of these things are integral to the teaching process . Ignoring the simplest things can sabotage your ability to deliver your teaching . The set prepares your class for the learning that is about to happen . <p> For example poor lighting or visibility can prevent students from being able to watch you demonstrate techniques and a student that can not hear you during a demonstration will clearly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere ' within the class . Are your classes friendly and welcoming and do they create an environment that will help your students to remain motivated ? Ask your students how they felt the first time they came to your class and what they enjoy about the way in which you conduct your classes . Focus on keeping the things that you do well and eliminating the things that you do badly . <p> Props are often overlooked . Certain things are a given and must be present in order for you to teach your class . Good quality mats are an example of this and a clock and timer are also essentials for most Jiu Jitsu classes . When teaching children I use a variety of props , such as balls , balloons , soft crash mats and cones . When planning my classes I always set these props aside and ensure that they are transported to the class . There is nothing worse than arriving at a class having planned to play a certain game or use a certain prop and then realising you have left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The objectives of your class should be stated in your set . I find it very helpful to convey a sense of the significance of what I am teaching to my students , especially with children and beginners . If you are teaching the straight armlock from closed guard , do your students have an understanding of what the closed guard is and why it is relevant ? Does the technique that you are teaching have self-defence applications ? If you are teaching something that is more competition based , does it score points or will the improper application of it result in potential disqualification ? A statement of the objectives or learning outcomes can provide a very useful agenda for the class and I often revisit it in the final part of the session . <h> The Dialogue <p> The dialogue is your means of communicating your lesson plan to your students . This is the core part of the planned learning experience and facilitates the passage of knowledge from you to your student . <p> Some experts argue that less than 10% of communication is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety and non-verbal communication are actually much more important . <p> Your voice has a major impact upon your students and if your voice is monotone and unexciting you run the risk of boring them . One of the commonest mistakes made by teachers during the dialogue is to talk too quickly , fortunately this is also the easiest to fix by simply slowing down . Another common mistake is to talk too quietly so that you can not be heard by all of your students . <p> Non-verbal communication is also very important and covers a wide range of behaviours including gesturing , facial expression and eye contact . A great example of a Jiu Jitsu teacher that uses non-verbal communication very well during his lessons is my instructor and friend Oli Geddes . I noticed a while back that Oli uses a few different gestures with great effect during his lesson . An example of this is the clicking of his fingers , if Oli wants emphasise a particular movement , such as an underhook , he directs your attention by clicking the fingers of the hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my children 's classes and noticed that the retention of the technique improved dramatically and that the children were no longer mixing up their left and right hands . This simple gesture had a dramatic effect upon the ability of the kids to learn the techniques . <h> The Four-Stage Teaching Approach <p> One teaching technique that I commonly use during the dialogue is the four-stage teaching approach ' . This is the principal method I have used to teach complex trauma management and resuscitation skills over the years , and it translates beautifully into teaching Jiu Jitsu techniques . <p> The four-stages can be summarised as follows : <p> 1 . The technique is demonstrated in real time . This can be done silently or with speech but it should show the technique as it would appear without it being broken down into smaller steps . <p> 2 . The technique is repeated , this time broken down into steps and accompanied by dialogue . Rationale for your actions should by provided in this stage <p> 3 . The technique is demonstrated once again , this time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by asking the class to talk me through the technique step-by-step and then perform each step as they guide me . <p> 4 . The students go away and drill the technique together in pairs or groups . Enough time should be allowed to practice the technique until the class is confident and competent in the technique . This step completes the transference of the technique from the teacher to the student . <h> Closure <p> I like to separate closure into two distinct parts : the asking of questions and the summary . I usually do this after teaching part of the session and before sparring commences but I sometimes leave to until the very end of the class after the warm down . I do n't  believe that there is a right or wrong time to do it but it should always form part of learning experience . <p> There is a popular phrase that states There is no such thing as a stupid question ' and I always try to encourage my students to ask questions , as it is an opportunity to check any uncertainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid for asking a question that might have an obvious answer and try to look at the techniques that you have taught through the eyes of a white belt . <p> The summary is an opportunity to reinforce what has been learnt and give your students a take home message ' . If there is one thing you want them to remember from today 's lesson this is your chance to emphasise it . Remain succinct and to the point and try not to run through every detail that you have taught . <h> Optimise the passage of knowledge from you to your students <p> Try using this structure next time you teach a class and see if it makes a difference to your lesson . By ensuring that the set well prepared , the dialogue is engaging and the closure is clear and succinct , the learning experience should be optimal for the rapid and effective passage of knowledge from you to your students . <p> Good luck , and enjoy your teaching ! 181481 @qwx591481

This is usually a set position ( e.g. the guard or the mount etc. ) or with a restricted set of parameters ( e.g. only able to use a certain attack etc . ) In my opinion , specific sparring is one of the most important aspects of jiu-jitsu training . <h> Sparring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what differentiates Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu , Boxing and other functional martial arts . Most academies do about 30 minutes of sparring towards the end of the lesson . Initially , when you have little technique and have not yet learned to move your body efficiently , you will find this incredibly exhausting . However , you can make it easier on yourself . <p> My advice to you is this : Learn to relax as much as possible during sparring . Try not to grip too tight , as this drains you very quickly . Your grips should only as tight as required to hold on to your opponent 's gi and no more . Also , learn to control your breathing while you are sparring . The more smooth and even your breathing , the longer you will be able to last . This translates into more matches per lesson , which results into faster progress . <h> Stretching " Cool Down <p> This is a great time to stretch because your muscles are nice and warm after the intense sparring . <p> Remember to exhale as you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force the stretch too much as you risk injuring yourself . If you are very inflexible , I recommend you spend an extra 10-15 minutes after the class to work on your overly tight areas .

@@60348934 @348934/ <h> BJJ and Back Pain <p> This article by jiu jitsu brown belt and medical doctor , Marc Barton , gives helpful tips for those suffering from back pain induced by BJJ- training . <p> Back pain is an extremely common problem for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners . Rarely a class goes by without someone I know complaining of it to some extent . Jiu Jitsu is a tough activity on the body generally and tends to put a lot of stress on the lower back . Trying to escape certain positions , such as the mount , requires a strong lower back , and getting stacked puts a great deal of tension through the muscles and ligaments attached to the lumbar spine . For this reason it 's hardly surprising that back problems are so common for us . <p> Its not just Jiu Jitsu practitioners that experience back problems though , and approximately 8 out of 10 people experience it at some point in their lives . The main difference is that as a group of people we tend to try to continue training despite the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself may not be a bad thing at all and I strongly believe that it is not necessary for the vast majority of Jiu Jitsu practitioners to stop training because of back issues . <p> The most common type of back pain is nonspecific ' or mechanical ' back pain . It is called nonspecific back pain because it is not due to any specific or underlying disease . It is not fully understood what causes this type of pain but most medical practitioners feel it is due to a sprain of the muscles or ligaments attached to the lumbar spine . Other possible causes include problems with the vertebral facet joints or intervertebral discs . This type of pain , for the most part , is not considered dangerous or worrying , but this is little consolation for those of us that suffer with it . <p> It is very important to distinguish this nonspecific back pain from the more serious , but rarer , nerve root pain that occurs in around 1 in 20 cases of back pain . In these cases the nerve coming out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of pain that causes sciatica , as the pain is felt along the course of the nerve . Nerve root pain is potentially much more serious as it can cause permanent damage to the affected nerve . For this reason it is very important to get your back pain assessed by a medical practitioner , such as your GP or a qualified physiotherapist , at the outset and before you go on to use any of the techniques advised in this article . <p> My own personal journey with back pain started about 4 years ago . Around that time I transitioned from being a recreational Jiu Jitsu practitioner , training a couple of times a week , to someone who was training much more frequently . A couple of years ago I left my day job and became a full time instructor . I now am teaching or training almost every day and often multiple times a day . Back pain has become a part of my everyday life . Getting out of bed in the morning has became an endeavour in itself and putting on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised I had taken for granted . I have visited numerous physiotherapists and osteopaths over the past couple of years and my back is now greatly improved . I would like to share some of my favourite and most trusted coping methods with you . <p> Here are my top five tips for combating back pain as a Jiu Jitsu practitioner : <h> Adapt your game <p> I learnt this strategy from one of my instructors Steve Finan , who is a black belt under the legendary Mauricio Gomes . Despite being in his early 50s Steve is one of the very toughest guys I regularly roll with . I believe his longevity and ability to roll so hard in his 50s is due to the intelligence with which he approaches training . He has also experienced back problems and has very cleverly adapted his game to overcome this . He has helped me to adapt my own game , so that I now avoid movements and positions which put my lower back under stress . An example of this is the classic side control escape . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shin across and regaining guard . I have now adapted this so that I slowly bridge my hips but explosively drop downwards . The net effect is the same but without the associated strain on the lower back . I have similarly adapted escapes from mount and other positions and this has helped me to combat back pain a great deal . <h> Strengthen your core <p> One of the keys to a healthy back is a strong core . Jiu Jitsu in general , but particularly the various guard positions , tends to strengthen the abdominal muscles , but lower back strengthening is often neglected by Jiu Jitsu practitioners . Having a strong core can help to combat the pain caused by strain to the ligaments and muscles around the lumbar spine and can also help to heal the commonest types of back pain . The Swiss ball is a very helpful piece of equipment for this and Rener Gracie describes how he uses it to strengthen his core is this excellent video tutorial : <h> Take up Yoga <p> Yoga may have been the single biggest factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back problems . Hamstring and lumbar spine flexibility is extremely important in maintaining a healthy back and can also help to reduce tension , stiffness and soreness . There are many very helpful Yoga poses for lower back pain but these are my own personal favourites : <p> Child 's pose " this is a fantastic restorative Yoga pose and is very effective at lengthening the spine. - <p> Downward-facing Dog " this is the classic Yoga pose , it opens the shoulders and lengthens the thoracic and lumbar spine as well as stretching out the hamstrings. - <p> Upward-Facing Dog " this pose stretches the abdominal muscles and helps to opens up the intervertebral disc spaces . <p> Twisted Tiger " this pose was taught to me by my friend Chill Winston Yoga instructor Marvin Reid . It twists the torso and is excellent at stretching out the muscles and relieving tension on either side of the back in turn . It requires you to lie over a bolster but is well worth the investment . <h> Go swimming <p> Swimming is my go to exercise when I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no strain on the back at all . It is an excellent form of active stretching and also helps to build a strong core . When swimming you are supported by the water and it releases much of the pressure that is transmitted through the spine when standing upright . I find backstroke and front crawl particularly helpful . Swimming also releases endorphins , which are natural painkillers , and following a swim my back always feels better . If your back injury is particularly severe or the pain unmanageable , try just wading in the water or doing low impact exercises in the pool initially , before gradually progressing on to swimming . <h> Seek help ! <p> It is very important not to go it alone ' . Seeking help from a qualified medical practitioner may prevent you causing further damage or missing a more serious cause for the pain . Several times over the past few years a trip to the physiotherapist has helped salvage the situation and get me back on the mats quickly . <p> I still have bad days and my back is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now have more good days than bad and I 'm still in the game and training and teaching regularly . I hope that if you are suffering with lower back problems that some of these strategies , that have help me so much , will also help you to combat your back pain and keep training . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60348936 @348936/ <h> Awareness and the Jiu-Jitsu Fighter <h> Awareness and the Jiu-Jitsu Fighter <p> Every week I get emailed questions from readers of the Jiu-Jitsu Brotherhood asking things like : <p> There 's this big guy in my class , how do I beat him ' - or- I ca n't get the half-guard to work on this one purple belt ' <p> I find this frustrating because I can not tell you how or when you will be able to beat a certain opponent . I can not give you a magic formula or a secret technique that will be your sparring partner 's kryptonite . <p> But what I can share with you is a way to make it so that it 's not an issue anymore . <p> For me , the answer was to change my jiu-jitsu training from an outcome ' based to awareness ' based experience . <p> When you shift the purpose of your time on the mat from gathering new techniques or winning and losing to the development of your consciousness , you will experience profound changes in your bjj and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with events in the future ( victory , sweep etc. ) or the past ( missed submission opportunity , poor referee decision ) you will instead begin to operate from the source of your greatest power the present moment . <p> What is Awareness ? <p> I have found many definitions , but the two I feel are most appropriate are : <p> The dynamic , holistic act of processing and understanding the training experience . <p> This includes , - among other things , knowledge of : <p> Your body it 's position in space , your breathing rate etc . <p> Your environment the surface of the mat , your kimono etc . <p> Your training partner - his weight/pressure , his movements and reactions <p> Your technical options the movements you have mastered <p> Your awareness can be focused on one of the above or spread out over all of them . I like the analogy of the flashlight and the lantern . When your awareness is concentrated on one thing at the exclusion of all others , it is like a flashlight beaming into a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of space . <p> When you broaden and expand your awareness to include the other elements like a lantern illuminating the entire room it provides a much broader perspective . <p> Neither one of these is better than the other , and each has their place . Unfortunately many bjj fighters only know how to center their awareness on a single aspect ( usually technical options ) , and this can come at the cost of being unable to see the bigger picture . <p> Awareness Between Fighters <p> Imagine 2 jiu-jitsokas of roughly equal size , technical ability and mental attributes . Let 's call them white ' and black ' . They touch fists and are about to commence sparring . We can imagine that their awareness combined would resemble something like the yin-yang figure below , with the light half representing one fighter and the dark half representing the other . <p> - <p> Imagine that during the match white becomes fatigued and black takes mount and starts to apply the cross-choke . White 's awareness would shrinks and black 's would expand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a constant ebb and flow of awareness between two fighters . The ultimate contraction in awareness comes with the submission . When you tap it is because the attack has contracted your awareness so dramatically that you are only aware of the sensation in the joint about to become damaged , or the onset of unconsciousness from a neck attack . <p> Think about this : Chokes and strangles , taken to their completion , render a fighter- unconscious. - A loss of consciousness represents the most complete contraction of awareness . <p> Learning to notice and feel this expansion and contraction of your own awareness and how it interacts with that of your opponent is a valuable skill . <p> Why Focus on Awareness ? <p> Improved Reaction Time <p> Between a stimulus and your response to it there is a window of time . With increases in your awareness that time seems to become longer . This perceived expansion ' in time will allow you to process more information and improve your reactions . <p> Perception of Options <p> Awareness allows you to see options you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted you may miss out on submission/escape/sweep opportunities . I see this very often while teaching . A student is so focused on getting a specific move to work that he misses a more effective and superior option that 's staring him in the face . <p> Personal Growth <p> Victories are forgotten , techniques can lose effectiveness and your physical ability will eventually fade , but expansions in your level of awareness will remain with you for your entire life . I see jiu-jitsu as a tool with which we forge our spirits , and through development of awareness we are able to expedite our progress . <p> Enjoyment <p> Personally , I just have more fun when I approach jiu-jitsu with this mindset . Grappling is a lot like life . The more you stop trying to control it and instead just embrace the complete experience , the better it gets . <p> How to Expand Your Awareness <p> Before I begin training I start to expand my awareness and perception using adaptations from various meditation systems I 've been exposed to over the years . I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare myself for each session . <p> Internal Focus Exercise <p> Begin by taking several deep , even breaths using this cadence : Four seconds inhalation and four seconds exhalation . Notice how the air passes into your nasal passages through your lungs and down into your belly. - Really get a feel for the expansion and contraction of your diaphragm and ribcage during this process . For even more effectiveness , try to listen to the sound of your breathing at the same time . <p> Next , start to actively tense and relax and the muscle groups over which you have conscious control . Start at your feet and work your way up the top of you head . <p> Combining deep breathing with muscular contractions helps get you out of your head and into your body ' which is good for expanding awareness . <p> External Focus Exercise <p> The objective here is to gather as much sensory information from your environment as possible . Become observant of everything around you . Feel the gi against your skin . Notice the coolness of the mat against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dojo . <p> Using your senses fully to take in what 's happening around you will bring you into the present moment and ensure that you get the most out of each session . <p> Conditioning is Vital <p> The fitter , stronger and more flexible your body , the better . Nothing contracts your awareness as quickly as gassing . You are unable to think clearly and process information from your environment when you 're so exhausted that your tongue is hanging out . If you want to be a good jiu-jitsoka you have to be in shape . There 's no way around it . You can find more information on bjj conditioning- here . <p> Breath Control &amp; Relaxation <p> I have stressed over and over again in my writing that breath control is the foundation of all awareness . When your breathing pattern is poor , so too is your awareness . When in doubt , focus your attention on your breathing . Try to make it rhythmic and controlled . This will calm you and clear your mind , and your awareness will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further detail- here . <p> Your level of relaxation while sparring is also plays a huge role . This is why beginners are usually so difficult to teach . While sparring they become incredibly tense and can focus on only one thing at a time ( which is usually just grabbing and squeezing whatever part of their opponent is closest ) . The more you relax , the easier it is to become conscious of the learning process and accelerate it . <p> I realize this way of looking at jiu-jitsu may not be appropriate for everyone , and that it may be difficult for some to shift their existing mindsets . There are however huge rewards for those who are willing and open-minded enough to take the chance and try it out . Let me know how it works out for you . adrotate group= " 5 ? 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60348943 @348943/ <h> Important Tips for Beginners <p> During my journey into grappling and brazilian jiu jitsu , I have come across several principles and pieces of advice which have greatly accelerated my progress . I often find myself wondering just how much further ahead I would be today if I had known of them at the start of my training . It is for this reason that I try to ensure that the beginners I teach and my private clients are aware of them at the start of their grappling careers . Below I 've identified what I feel are the some of the most important tips for the beginners in bjj . <p> Prepare your body for training <p> No matter what anybody tells you , you need a certain basal level of strength and fitness to get the most out of jiu-jitsu . You do not play sports to get fit you get fit to play sports . The fitter you are , the more relaxed you will be during the sparring segment of your classes and therefore the more your mind will be able to absorb . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between sparring matches and between training sessions themselves . Resistance training and the increased muscle hypertrophy and joint strength it brings will go a long way in the prevention of jiu-jitsu related injuries . <p> Contrary to popular belief , an expensive gym membership and a bunch of machines and equipment are not a necessary requirement for getting fit . All you need is your own body , a small space and a degree of willpower . You can find a good introductory workout in the video below : <p> Leave your ego at the door <p> Your ego can be a great ( if not the greatest ) hindrance to your progress as a grappler . As a beginner you will tap often . Nobody likes to submit in front of the other students and spectators at their academy . Acknowledge that it is your ego that causes this discomfort and then do everything you can to overcome it . Accept the fact that you will be dominated and beaten regularly during the initial stages of your training and embrace it as part of the process . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit , but before then you will need to pay your dues . But remember that you should not be doing jiu-jitsu to learn to dominate people and prove that you are the toughest guy around . You should be doing it to learn about yourself . <p> Try this as an exercise in gaining control of your ego : Make it your mission to be tapped fifteen times at your next class . Bizarrely , this will actually make you a better fighter . Firstly , because you will come to not fear tapping anymore , you will begin to relax alot more during your sparring . As we know , there is direct correlation between how relaxed you are and how quickly you will learn . Secondly , by letting opponents put you in compromising situations and submissions you will quickly become familiar with them . This familiarity will ensure that you are more composed and hence more likely to escape if and when you are faced with these situations during competition . <p> Focus on the basics . <p> When you begin training it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are presented with into your game . There is something you must understand and that is that you do not need a thousand different moves to be good at jiu-jitsu . There are so many grapplers out there who can demonstrate hundreds and hundreds of techniques as well as the counters to them and even the re-counters to those . Most of these guys can not put even a fraction of this technical knowledge into practice against a resisting and determined opponent . A technique only becomes a skill once you can use it successfully in a fight . As practiced one kick 10,000 times . " Replace kicks with armlocks or chokes and the same holds true for grappling . <p> After 8 years of training I still find myself coming back to the most basic movements and techniques and trying to refine and tweak them to reflexive proficiency . As a beginner you should take a handful of simple things and work on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high percentage , fundamental moves such as the snake/shrimping motion and the bridge . This will ensure that you lay a solid foundation for your entire game . <p> Work on the things you find difficult . <p> After many years of training it will be more difficult to break bad habits and correct weakness you have developed . If you are intelligent , you will not allow the these negative tendencies to take hold when you start training . <p> Overspecialization breeds weakness . If you are a someone who loves to fight from the top and has no bottom game , sooner or later in class or competition you will meet someone who you can not dominate from the top and your lack of ability on the bottom will cost you . <p> If something is difficult for you , make it your focus . For example , if you hate playing from the guard , make it your number one priority during training . Try to get your opponent into your guard whenever possible and work from there . If you are diligent and can accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning ( leave your ego at the door ) , soon your guard will become strong . This applies to all positions and techniques . <p> I hope you learned something . As always , I would very much like to hear from your own experiences . 181481 @qwx591481

The child is part of a team in the greater sense of the academy or club but at the same time works as an individual , whether it is in drilling or rolling . The social cues required of team sports are not an issue for the child , while their experiences are celebrated by the team as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active part of the community , no longer isolated by their condition . <h> 2 . Social Relationships <p> As mentioned above , the concept of social interaction is a real challenge to students on the spectrum . The inability to properly interpret non verbal cues , tone , lack of eye contact and the rigid approach to dialogue makes it incredibly difficult for a child to build bonds and social relationships with others . Jiu jitsu can build a common interest that is shared with others . This opens a bridge and foundation for children with Autism to build social relationships with other based around the common interest of the sport itself . <h> 3 . Self-Confidence is Self-Defense <p> This is true of all who study Jiu jitsu but is especially true for children with autism . Children with autism face a great deal of challenges , not just in terms of social activity but also academics . They can be especially aware of these challenges , which can have a profound effect on their self-confidence . JiuJitsu is a fantastic way to build confidence in children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner stone to self-defense . When one is confident it shows in how they act and behave . In a school atmosphere , where bullying can be a major issue , the bully seeks out those students who look like easy targets . Unfortunately , students with autism tend to be seen as easy targets by bullies . However , the confidence that the child gains from their training and being part of the team shines through and bullies tend to shy away from them in favor of easier targets . <h> 4 . Sensory sensitivities , such as noise , light , clothing or food <p> Sensory overload is a common problem for children with autism . This can manifest in a variety of ways , whether it is aversion to noise , dislike of bright lighting , inability to digest certain types of food or intense dislike for the smells associated with different things . This can create a real challenge for these children in everyday life , where the constant distractions can be almost too much for them to handle . Jiu jitsu is a great way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncomfortable situations . Through Jiu jitsu they come into contact with constant challenges , whether it is escaping from a control position , sweeping an opponent or simply trying to figure out what to do next whilst under pressure . Learning to deal with these challenges and problem solving can greatly increase the child 's capacity to deal with their own sensory challenges . <h> 5 . Communication Difficulties <p> Kids with autism have major problems with developing speech and understanding social language . They also struggle greatly with eye contact or use of gestures in social contexts . Jiu jitsu provides numerous chances for one on one social interaction with coaches and training partners in an open and accepting environment . BJJ is much more informal and casual when compared to other martial arts . Individual expression and an inquisitive mindset is not only accepted but encouraged . This is ideal for kids with autism. 181481 @qwx591481

@@60348965 @348965/ <h> A Humbling Experience <p> I have trained all over the world with many top grapplers . Some could beat me and some could not , but they have all had to work hard and most of the time I posed at least some kind of threat to them during sparring . Roger is the only person I have ever rolled with who has the ability to neutralize all my attacks and destroy my defence almost at will . I have never sparred with anyone of his ability . The harder you try to beat him , the faster you tap out . And you tap out a lot . From submissions you did n't  even know existed . Hip cranks , Spine cranks , hamstring stretches ( yes hamstring stretches ! ) , its a humbling experience indeed . <p> Because his attacks are so good , you are always defending and trying to regain position , so its constantly an uphill struggle . You start in a neutral position ( knees or standing ) and then it just becomes progressively worse and worse as- he methodically imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion that I have managed to put him in a bad position , its only a few seconds before I begin to feel my leverage slip through my fingers like grains of sand through an hourglass . I have often found myself thinking " Yes ! I have good control ! " only to then watch helplessly as he executes the perfect escape and takes the top position before submitting me . <p> So why is he so good ? I believe the reasons are the following : <h> Physical Attributes <p> Roger is big and strong , there 's no argument about it . At almost 65 ? and about 220 lbs he s unusually large for jiu-jitsu fighter . I remember a certain training session in which we were doing stand-up training . He had an underhook which I thought I was defending reasonably well . I was placing all my weight on it to neutralize his leverage . When he got bored he suddenly threw me literally across the mat using just that underhook . I have trained with 300 lb wrestlers who have not had that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such a dangerous fighter . He combines high levels of attributes with perfect technical knowledge . In the unlikely event that you match him technically in any area he simply over powers you . <h> Technique <p> His depth of technical knowledge is supreme . Roger does n't  need the couple of seconds to analyze a position before his next movement that an average fighter does . This is because he knows the perfect technical response to each position so well that it has become reflex . Also , he is always at least 2 moves ahead . His first attack is usually just used to set you up for the second and third . <p> When you watch him roll , you see a demonstration of perfect economy of motion . Sometimes , he will have 3 or 4 of us spar with him in turn , changing to a fresh partner every few minutes , so that he can push himself even though he is training with inferior opponents . The strange thing about Roger , is that as he becomes tired , his technique actually becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is due to his size . He has had to learn the most energy efficient way to move his massive frame around during long sparring and training sessions as he becomes progressively more and more fatigued . This to me is the essence of jiu-jitsu . <h> Balance <p> Roger is not super muscular and ripped like many other fighters , but when you roll with him , him he feels " dense " . Its extremely difficult to move or lift him it feels as if his weight is being sucked towards the ground . During our sparring sessions many times I have tapped through sheer discomfort from the smothering techniques he employs . If he chooses to , he makes any specific part of your body ( usually your diaphragm ) carry his entire 100 kilos of weight . I believe this is because he has a highly developed ability to relax and contract his different muscle groups at will and because he has exceptional pressure sensitivity . <p> His base is also phenomenal . My sweeps are by far the strongest part of my game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I have only managed to sweep Roger once . And that 's because he was n't paying attention . Usually you 'll think you are about to sweep him you might even elevate him for a second , but because of his incredible balance he effortlessly readjusts and nullifies your attempt to reverse him . <h> Will <p> His greatest weapon is his mind . When he trains he brings an intensity which is hard to describe . During his sparring sessions with Braulio Estima , an exceptional grappler and also a world champion , I have seen him in situations in which I was certain he was going to tap . But he never does . He just relaxes and looks for just that millimetre- of space he requires to escape . When he s tired he always pushes himself even harder and calls for a fresh sparring partner . I believe that it is this mental strength and unwavering tenacity differentiate him from many other high-level jiu-jitsu players and have led to his massive success . 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60348970 @348970/ <h> How Jiu-Jitsu Works <h> Positional Strategy <p> What differentiates Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu from most martial arts is the employment of positional strategy . In jiu-jitsu , the position you are in relative to your opponent is paramount . A kick-boxer or a karateka is concerned with knocking out their opponent , but besides distance and angles , they do not give much thought to the position of their body in relation to their opponent 's . <p> Jiu-Jitsu first seeks to- establish a position , and then to finish the fight . <h> Why Positional Strategy ? <p> Simply , because it 's more effective . Although you will probably be practising it in its sporting variation , Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was created as a system of self-defence for the street . It was designed as the most effective , safest way of ending a confrontation against a bigger , stronger aggressor . Through testing in real-life scenarios , the Gracies discovered that a ) most fights ended on the ground , and b ) It was easier to control an opponent by first achieving a dominant position . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far higher chance of finishing the fight successfully from a dominant position than you do of catching an opponent with a lucky punch or kick . <h> Positional Dominance <p> In a jiu-jitsu match each fighter is constantly trying to achieve positional dominance . Being in a dominant position is desirable because is almost always means that gravity and/or leverage is on your side.You are also safer when you are in a dominant position because it will be difficult for your opponent to strike you or apply leverage against you . <h> Leverage <p> The scientific definition of leverage is beyond the scope of this text , but in a jiu-jitsu context , we can look at it like this : <p> Attacking a weaker part of your opponents body using a stronger part of yours . <p> Or , a slightly more detailed explanation : <p> Using as much of your body weight and the large , powerful muscles of your hips and core to apply concentrated pressure against a weaker or more vulnerable part of your opponent . <h> Transition <p> Transition refers to any period during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a movement from one position to another . Your goal should always be to ensure that any transition period ends with yourself in a dominant position . If you initiate a transition it should always end with you in a position superior to the one in which were previously . <p> If your transitions are good enough they themselves can become an intermediate form of control . Truly great grapplers switch so quickly and fluidly between superior positions that their opponents become confused and ineffective . <h> The Basic Formula <p> So taking into consideration what we have just learned , we can break jiu-jitsu into the following formula : <p> 1 . Take your opponent to the ground using a throw or takedown . <p> 2 . Transition to a dominant position as efficiently as possible . <p> 3 . Use leverage to finish the fight by applying a choke , strangle or joint-lock . <p> Another way of expressing the formula is : <p> TRANSITION G POSITION G SUBMISSION <p> Obviously , there 's a little more to it than that . Sometimes you end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape to a safer position , and then move to a dominant position . <p> Also , some positions are more dominant than others. , your goal should be to either improve your position even more , or finish the fight with a submission . <p> Most beginners skip part 2 and go straight on to part 3 . But the problem is that without the control afforded by the dominant position it will be extremely difficult to finish the opponent . <p> Trust me on this if you want to progress as quickly as possible do not focus too much on finishing your opponent. - Instead , look at the game from a Positional Strategy perspective and learn how to control your opponent comprehensively first .

@@60349009 @349009/ <h> Types of Grappling Martial Arts <p> This excerpt from Daniele Bolellis book On the Warriors Path describes the different styles of grappling martial arts . <p> Grappling systems are those Combat Sports that focus on throws and takedowns , and/or on ground-fighting ( which depending on the system includes pins and/or chokes and/or leverages . ) Examples of these arts are Kodokan Judo , Sumo , Brazilian Jujitsu , Chinese Shuai Chiao , Russsian Sambo , and the Western systems of Greco- Roman and Freestyle Wrestling . In addition to these systems , there are many forms of ethnic wrestling ( from Mongolia to Africa , just about every country in the world has some form of wrestling ) and eclectic systems based on some of the most popular grappling arts outlined above . <p> The differences between these arts have to do with the rules they abide by . The most important difference is whether a system is exclusively dedicated to takedowns and throws but does not include ground-fighting ( like Sumo , Shuai Chiao , and Mongolian Wrestling ) , or it employs both ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In the first group , the winner is the athlete who can execute a perfect throw while maintaining his/her own balance . In the second group , depending on the system , one may win because of a perfect throw , because of pinning the opponent to the floor , or because of a submission ( choke or leverage ) on the ground . <p> Another important difference has to do with the amount of clothing worn by the athletes in competition ( since clothing can be grabbed to make throws easier , the kind of throws employed change depending on the uniform worn . ) Here is a breakdown of the main characteristics of the major- grappling styles : <h> Judo : <p> Judo players wear a heavy jacket called a gi which is grabbed to execute the throws and facilitate submissions on the ground . Most of the throws are hip throws , hand throws , sweeps , and sacrifice throws ( those throws in which one willingly goes to the ground in order to take down the opponent ) . Judo discourages grabbing the opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to execute a throw . On the ground , Judo players aim at pinning the opponent with his back on the floor , or choking him in a variety of ways , or apply- ing a leverage ( the only leverages allowed are against the elbow joint ) . ( Kano 1986 , Takagaki 1957 ) <h> Sumo : <p> Sumo players rely on takedowns and throws . Pushing the opponent out of the circle delimitating the ring or taking him to the ground are the ways to achieve victory . Hardly any clothing is worn during the matches and no leverages or chokes are allowed . <h> Brazilian Jujitsu : <p> This recent form of Jujitsu ( created in the twentieth century ) specializes in ground-fighting . Fighters wear a Judo gi . Matches begin standing up but quickly a takedown ( usually a simpler , less flashy kind than those seen in Judo ) takes the match to the ground where chokes and leverages are applied . Legal leverages are those against almost any joint other than the fingers . <h> Shuai Chiao : <p> Shuai Chiao fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) For this reason , since they lack enough cloth to pull as much as Judo players do , they have to come closer to each other . Shuai Jiao does not include ground-fighting , but focuses exclusively on powerful throws and takedowns which often involve joint-locking ( Liang 1997 , Weng 1984 ) . <h> Sambo : <p> Sambo is an eclectic system combining Judo , Greco- Roman , and Freestyle Wrestling with ethnic forms of Russian Wrestling . Players wear a light jacket , and rely on throws as well as on ground-fighting . On the ground , chokes are not allowed but leverages against most joints ( including ankle and knee ) are ( Anderson &amp; B 1999 ) . <h> Western Wrestling : <p> Western wrestlers wear light uniforms that can not be easily grabbed to execute throws . For this reason , western wrestling favors either grabbing the legs to score a takedown or powerful body lifts resulting in a throw . On the ground , Wrestlers aim at pinning the opponent but can not apply chokes or joint-locks . The main difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow attacking the opponent 's legs or using one 's own legs to execute a throw whereas Freestyle does . <h> Submission Grappling : <p> Submission Grappling is very similar to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu but players do not wear a jacket or gi for training or competition . Another notable difference is that- most submission grappling rulesets- allow the application of most of the more dangerous submission attacks ( like certain leg-locks and neck-cranks ) which are illegal in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu . <h> Advantages of Grappling Arts <p> Among the good aspects of grappling systems from the point of view of realistic fighting is the fact that in reality it is very hard to keep an opponent at the distance required for the striking range , and clinching often follows the initial blows . For this reason , grappling systems offer the invaluable advantage of making one comfortable being at close quarters with an opponent . <p> Ground-fighting , in particular , is an excellent form of training since contrary to stand-up fighting where even if they are not trained , most people have some instinctive notions of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as for the fact that often one may end up on the ground whether he/she wants it or not , a person with a little knowledge of ground-fighting is far ahead of one who does not know anything about it . <h> Disadvantages of Grappling Arts <p> The disadvantage of specializing too much in ground-fighting is that ending up on the ground is suicidal in a situation where one has to face multiple opponents , since while one is busy fighting one opponent his still- standing friends can stomp on his/her head . <p> The throwing component of grappling systems is possibly the most important part one needs to master for the sake of realistic fighting . In fact , since the vast majority of fights end up in the clinch- ing range , if one is able to execute a throw , the chances of success sharply increase because taking a hard fall on concrete can knock out even the toughest opponents . Furthermore , in a situation with multiple opponents , one can incapacitate an opponent by throwing him hard and immediately move on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems inherent in grappling training , as far as realistic fighting goes , is that some of the rules teach bad habits that would be very dangerous to follow in a real situation . For example , when Judo players and Western wrestlers turn face down while on the ground in order to avoid being pinned with their back against the floor , they are effectively exposing their head and neck to the opponent . Of course , this would be the worst thing to do in a real situation . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60349037 @349037/ <h> Practice Jiu Jitsu With No Hands <p> Almost without exception , one of the most common mistakes novice grapplers make is that they try and move their opponent 's entire bodyweight with the strength of their arms . This is due to the fact that the hands and arms are some of the most dexterous and sensitive parts of the human anatomy , and we as human beings are simply accustomed to using them for almost all our day to day tasks , while are legs are usually solely employed for standing and walking . Unfortunately , in grappling , using your arms exclusively is grossly inefficient . On average , the human leg is three times stronger than the human arm , and the trunk as a whole unit is stronger still . Therefore it is vital to learn to access this massive strength reserve . For a good grappler his legs and feet are as nimble as another set of arms and hands , and he employs them to push , pull , lift and pin his opponent . <p> An excellent way of teaching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arms is to do jiu jitsu with no hands . <p> If you are a gi grappler , slide both hands through the front of your belt grip each free end .

Initially he should not go flat out when rolling with you in this manner . In the beginning his goal should be not to submit you but merely control your body . Once you have become more accustomed to it he should try to look for the finish . <p> At first , this will feel very awkward and you will have a tendency to cheat by reflexively reaching out with your hands . Bear with it , because as you gain coordination and sensitivity with your lower body your grappling will improve , especially certain aspects of your game i.e. open guard . <p> Later , when you reintroduce your arms , try to use the following analogy .

@@60349050 @349050/ <h> Practice Jiu Jitsu With No Hands <p> Almost without exception , one of the most common mistakes novice grapplers make is that they try and move their opponent 's entire bodyweight with the strength of their arms . This is due to the fact that the hands and arms are some of the most dexterous and sensitive parts of the human anatomy , and we as human beings are simply accustomed to using them for almost all our day to day tasks , while are legs are usually solely employed for standing and walking . Unfortunately , in grappling , using your arms exclusively is grossly inefficient . On average , the human leg is three times stronger than the human arm , and the trunk as a whole unit is stronger still . Therefore it is vital to learn to access this massive strength reserve . For a good grappler his legs and feet are as nimble as another set of arms and hands , and he employs them to push , pull , lift and pin his opponent . <p> An excellent way of teaching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arms is to do jiu jitsu with no hands . <p> If you are a gi grappler , slide both hands through the front of your belt grip each free end . If your chosen art is submission wrestling , simply cross your arms and grab each opposite shoulder . Remember that this will require an accommodating sparring partner . Initially he should not go flat out when rolling with you in this manner . In the beginning his goal should be not to submit you but merely control your body . Once you have become more accustomed to it he should try to look for the finish . <p> At first , this will feel very awkward and you will have a tendency to cheat by reflexively reaching out with your hands . Bear with it , because as you gain coordination and sensitivity with your lower body your grappling will improve , especially certain aspects of your game i.e. open guard . <p> Later , when you reintroduce your arms , try to use the following analogy . Think of your arms as the rudder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Your legs , hips and lower back are the motor and propeller of the boat . They provide the drive . A classic example of this is the double-leg take down . You set your rudder ' ( arms ) by grabbing behind your opponent 's legs and then the motor ' ( legs , trunk ) provides the power by driving through and lifting the opponent . <p> This is not a hard and fast rule " there are several movements that use arm and shoulder strength almost exclusively ( a key-lock from side-mount is an example although even this could be argued ) , but in general it holds true . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60349060 @349060/ <h> Cauliflower Ear and Jiu Jitsu How to Treat and Prevent it <p> This article was written by medical doctor and BJJ- brown belt , Marc Barton . <p> If you train in a grappling art , such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or wrestling , the chances are that you know many people with cauliflower ears and that you may even have one yourself . <p> Cauliflower ears are nothing new and combat athletes have suffered with this ailment for millennia . The famous statue of the Boxer at Rest ' from ancient Greece nicely demonstrates an example of this and dates back over 2300 years . <h> What is a Cauliflower Ear ? <p> Cauliflower ear is one of the most common facial injuries suffered and is particularly prevalent in grapplers . It occurs when the outer portion of the ear ( the pinna or auricle ) is struck resulting in the dense connective tissue within the ear ( the perichondrium ) to separate from the underlying cartilage . Small blood vessels are situated in this area and these proceed to bleed causing the area to swell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clot will form , called an auricular haematoma . This haematoma stimulates the production of new cartilage , and it is only once this deformed cartilage has developed that the injury is referred to as a cauliflower ear . <p> Cauliflower ears are often considered to be a badge of honour ' amongst grapplers and combat sports athletes but they are associated with several potential problems and medical complications , and should ideally be treated quickly to prevent these from occurring . <p> Apart from being unsightly they can be prone to infection , and painful inflammation of the cartilage , called chondritis , can occur . Severe cases can cause the ear canal to become blocked , which can affect hearing and I have one friend that is no longer able to wear earbud headphones because of his . Once you have an established cauliflower ear they are also more prone to developing another heamatoma or further damage . This can be very dramatic on occasion , as anyone that watched Leslie Smith 's fight at UFC 118 will attest to ! <h> Prevention is Better Than Cure <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than cure ' , and this is particularly true for cauliflower ears . The easiest way to prevent a cauliflower ear is to wear headgear or earguards . These will effectively protect the ear from the blunt shearing forces that typically cause the heamatoma to form . It is worth mentioning that some competitions do not allow these to be worn and some athletes find them too cumbersome or uncomfortable to wear . <p> If you are in a situation where the wearing of earguards is not permitted or simply prefer not to wear them at all try to develop an awareness of where your head and ears are whilst grappling . For example , if you are caught in a tight guillotine or triangle and can feel intense pressure on the ear then do n't  try to just rip your head out of the position using brute force . If you are just rolling with a friend in a non-competitive match ask them to readjust without changing the position too much . If the situation is extreme and the ear is being severely compressed you always have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emergency Department to get it drained ! <h> How Are Cauliflower Ears Treated ? <p> There are a large number of articles and videos online showing how to self treat an auricular haematoma that has developed . As a doctor I would , however , strongly advise against self-treatment due to the associated risks . It is far better to get the procedure performed in a sterile setting by an experienced professional than do a botch job at home and risk the heamatoma just re-accumulating , or even worse a serious infection developing . <p> One simple measure that can be used prior to getting medical advice is to apply ice to the area . This can lessen the swelling prior to the drainage being performed . The ear is relatively avascular though and ice should not be left on for long periods of time . <p> The sooner that help can be sought the better , and the process of draining the haematoma itself is relatively simple . The ear should be thoroughly cleaned before the procedure is commenced to minimize the risk of infection . A fine-bore needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained . This may require several aspirations and if the heamatoma is large a small incision is also sometimes required . <p> This excellent video by Stuart Cooper shows Roberto Cyborg ' Abreu having his ear being drained in the run up to the ADCC tournament . <p> After the ear has been drained , compression bandaging will need to be applied or a small sponge button ' sutured onto the area that has been drained . If this is not done blood will simply re-accumulate and the ear will need to be drained again . Sometimes a doctor will prescribe antibiotics if they are concerned about potential infection . <p> Another novel way of preventing re-accumulation is the CauliCure magnet system , which is shown in this video : <p> After the procedure the ear should be kept dry and clean until the area has settled down and healed . Further trauma should be avoided to prevent worsening the damage and developing an infection . <p> Once new cartilage has been established and a true cauliflower ear has developed the ear will not be able to be drained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expensive plastic surgery . It is therefore a far better option to get the heamatoma drained as soon as possible following the incident that caused it . 181481 @qwx591481

@@60349075 @349075/ <h> Jiu Jitsu Life Lessons <p> I have had many excellent teachers in my life up until this point , but Jiu-Jitsu has been by far the greatest of them all . I am presented with new lessons each and every time I step on the mat . Some of these lessons I learned early , some only after many years of training , and with others I am still receiving my instruction . <h> Patience is a Virtue <p> It does n't  take much to see that we are living in a world addicted to instant gratification . People want results immediately . This impulsive state of being is fundamentally incompatible with jiu-jitsu . The art has two ways of punishing those who are not mature enough to be patient . <p> Firstly , if a move is rushed it is much more likely to fail . If I become greedy for a submission I very often lose it . However , if I take my time and analyze the position if I am patient enough to think before moving the finish is far more likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills in a short space of time quickly become frustrated , and many even give up . Jiu-Jitsu is not something that can be rushed . True , their are ways to maximize the effectiveness of the learning process , but it still requires time . Very often our progress seems to plateau and it feels as if we are not improving . It takes patience to ride out these plateaus and wait for results to manifest.I have learned through jiu-jitsu that patience is a virtue which improves almost all aspects of my life . <h> Its all about Perception <p> When we are rolling , its rare that we encounter a position or situation that has only a right and wrong response . Instead , there are usually ways and better ways of reacting . To me this offers an intelligent and efficient way of looking at the world . <p> Many years ago , while sparring with my first instructor , I found myself caught in a knee-bar . As I was about to tap , he asked me " Why do n't  you escape ? " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishly replied . He proceed to show me a simple movement which neutralized all of his leverage and allowed me to escape the lock . I had been , in his words , locked against my own perception . The escape had always been there I just had n't  seen it before . <p> Similarly , when I was younger , there were many situations in my life where I was convinced that I had only one course of action available to me . By adapting what I have learned through jiu-jitsu , I have come to realize that there are always more than one or two possibilities . All it takes for us to be able to see these possibilities is an expansion of our perception . <h> Embrace Change <p> So many people go through their lives resisting and avoiding change , much to their detriment . <p> The speed at which the world is changing can be intimidating . Just as the world is not the same place it was thirty years ago , so is jiu-jitsu not the same as it was during the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for growth . Jiu-jitsu is a living thing like you and I , and all healthy living things grow . <p> If I keep attacking my sparring partners with the same submissions and set-ups they will soon learn to counter them and defeat me . Anything that stands still is soon overtaken . We need to adapt or we are unable to keep up with the dynamism of the art . <p> Jiu-jitsu has helped me recognize this need for constant change , and through this recognition allowed me to strive for continual transformation and progression in life . <h> Know When to Yield <p> Bruce Lee said " Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked , while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind . " This is a important characteristic of a jiu-jitsu practitioner and one of the most overlooked and important aspects of our art . <p> The literal translation of jiu-jitsu or ju-jitsu is " gentle or compliant technique " . <p> Many forget this . Their standard recourse while fighting is to try and meet their opponent head on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents strength in that particular area is greater . The more you try to resist an adversarys force the harder he will push against yours . Sometimes its wiser to not resist his pressure , but instead to yield to it and then redirect it . <p> I believe that in life the same applies . Often people and situations may seem to overwhelm us . By thinking like a jiu-jitsuko , we can learn to determine when it is prudent to yield to these stresses and divert their force to our own ends . <p> What jiu jitsu life lessons have you learned ?

@@60349093 @349093/ <h> Why Jiu Jitsu is Good for You <p> When practised correctly , jiu jitsu is good for you . If you devote yourself to training several times per week you can expect great improvements in your sense of well-being . Here are some of the reasons I feel this . <p> The body as an instrument <p> The the one thing that we all share during the human experience is our inhabitation of a physical body its with us for this entire journey . Some of our bodies are big , some are little , and some are stronger than others , but with few exceptions its a pretty unified experience . <p> These bodies are such complex and powerful organisms and our physiques are capable of so much more than most people realize or utilize . The vast majority of the human race will never get to use their bodies to the extent that a jiu-jitsoka does . <p> About ten years ago a popular song named Sunscreen was released . It offered various pieces of advice through its lyrics , one of which was " Enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest instrument you 'll ever own . " <p> Extending the analogy , we could view jiu-jitsu is an extremely complex , evolving piece of diagnostic software which allows us to test and maintain these instruments . <p> In death our bodies become cold and stiff , whereas life is typified by movement and heat . Taking this into consideration , I believe jiu-jitsu to be one of the most important expressions and representations of life . <p> When we grapple we engage in a large portion of the range of physical actions and movements available to a human being . This includes but is not limited to jumping , pulling , lifting , twisting , bending , reaching , gripping , pushing , dragging , rolling and kicking . Not only is the range of actions varied , but they are almost always done in combination we lift and twist or reach and drag etc . Movement is life . Jiu-jitsu is movement . Jiu-jitsu is life . <p> Those of us that roll know that nothing compares to the workout derived from an intense grappling match . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise generates huge amounts of heat in all of our corporeal tissues . In the medical philosophies of many cultures , heat is a healing agent . It is said to promote regeneration , pliability and eradication of disease . Heat is life . Jiu-jitsu is heat . Jiu-jitsu is life . <p> There are numerous other benefits associated with the gentle art too . The skin is the human beings largest organ , and jiu-jitsu is an excellent method for keeping it healthy . The heavy perspiration experienced during grappling aids in the elimination of toxins and the friction from the kimono cleanses your skin by scrubbing away dead cells . Good health of the internal organs is also promoted . The constant multi-planar bending of the torso and pressure of your opponents weight on your frame massages the intestines , liver , kidneys and spleen , and promotes circulation of clean blood to them . Also , because of the aerobic nature of longer sparring sessions , the heart and lungs are also kept in peak condition . Testing the intrument <p> Grappling is a very effective method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It differs from most other forms of exercise because the experience is so unpredictable and dynamic . Because you are challenged from so many awkward positions , you are forced to perform movements which are foreign and difficult for your body . <p> During sparring we are presented the challenge of moving our bodies through space at unusual angles and through multiple planes . We also have to deal with the dynamic resistance offered by our opponents constantly shifting mass . When strive to balance our own weight and simultaneously manouver that of our opponent we are involved in an activity that is uniquely challenging . <p> Vast quantities of both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers are recruited during jiu-jitsu . This muscular involvement is not limited to the larger , primary muscle groups , but includes all of the stabilizing structures as well . From the tips of the toes to the top of the head , almost every single muscle is constantly involved in the process . Jiu-jitsu quickly exposes weaknesses , which , if not dealt with , may lead to infirmity in old age , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> During intense practices we employ our physical resources in a way that few other activities can come close to equaling .

@@60349126 @349126/ <h> What it Takes to be a Quality Jiu Jitsu Black Belt <p> To maximize your potential as a jiu-jitsoka , its not enough to just head to class every day and go through the motions . You need to approach your training from several angles . <p> One of the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tips that has worked for my students and is a system which I call the A.C.T . Model . This stands for Attribute Maximization , Conceptual Understanding , Technical Knowledge . This article will provide a general overview of this model . <p> Jiu-jitsu is a highly athletic endeavour . It is one of the most physical of all martial arts and sports , and demands a lot from those who practice it . You need to maximize your attributes if you want to maximize your jiu-jitsu . <p> After Royce Gracie 's early wins in the UFC over much bigger and stronger opponents , there began a popular misconception in the grappling arts that size and strength were not important , and that technique was all that mattered . <p> A lot of jiu-jitsu guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need is technique . " This is simply not true . Stronger , fitter individuals have a huge advantage over others . This is why the 250 lbs , rugby-playing white belt is usually much harder to spar with than the 140 lbs , super-skilled purple belt . This is also why the absolute division at the world champs is never won by lightweights . <p> It is true that the leverage afforded by grappling techniques often allows those with lesser attributes to defeat larger , stronger opponents . However there is no denying that being more powerful , faster or fitter than someone gives you an advantage over him , regardless of his level of technique . It is when you combine great attributes with technical and conceptual knowledge you have the makings of an exceptional grappler . <p> The good news is that most attributes can be improved through intelligent , specific training . This will be the topic of future posts . <p> Andre Galvao is a BJJ athlete who has maximized all of his physical attributes <p> Conceptual Understanding <p> Conceptual Understanding refers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art . These include things like leverage , biomechanics and breath control . <p> There are an infinite number of technical situations in jiu-jitsu , and new ones are being developed all the time . You will never be able to learn every single attack , defense , counter and combination . There will always be holes in your game . Conceptual understanding fills in the gaps in your technical knowledge . It allows you to create your own movements and adapt quickly when you do not have a technical response to a particular circumstance . <p> For example , let 's say during a sparring session that your opponent has a great guard and you feel him set up a sweep which you are not familiar with . Although you might not know the ideal technical defense to his attack , if your understanding of the concept of " base " is good it will still be difficult for him to complete his move . <p> See the concepts section of this site for examples of Conceptual Understanding . Also , look for the work of Matt Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technical Knowledge is a framework of response patterns to specific situations , usually following the simple formula of If x , then y . An example , " If I am in guard and my opponent puts his hand on my chest , then I trap his arm , step on his hip " etc . <p> Most BJJ academies focus heavily on this aspect of training . The beauty of a technique is that it usually represents the most efficient way of accomplishing an objective . I say usually , because even great techniques are often replaced by more effective variations . <p> Long-time black belt and instructor Roy Harris speaks of " Technique Collectors " . This is the guy who watches every single YouTube video of the most advanced , inverted x-guard sweeps and owns every single jiu-jitsu instructional DVD on the planet , but ask him to mount and choke anyone in sparring and he s completely lost . <p> Technical knowledge can be broadly categorized into depth and breadth . Technique collectors usually have great breadth of knowledge , or the know a little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , i.e. they specialize in only a few positions or techniques , but they know these really well . The great jiu-jitsu practitioners have both breadth and depth of technical knowledge . <p> The best ways I have found to improve technique are physical repetition and visualization . <p> Becoming Complete <p> To become a complete jiu-jitsoka you need to be strong , have a familiarity of the concepts underpinning the art , and also have great technique . Try to identify any aspects where you are deficient , focus on improving them , and ultimately make them your strengths . 181481 @qwx591481

If you want to round out this aspect of your game , you will need to attend either a dedicated freestyle wrestling or judo class . <p> If you 've never tried either and the idea of starting a new art is daunting- keep in mind that , unlike jiu-jitsu , you do n't  need a particularly wide repertoire of techniques to become proficient in either of them . Becoming good at 2 or 3 attack combinations will usually be enough and this can usually be accomplished in a year or two . <h> Reciprocal Effect <p> When I 've been focusing on my stand-up game for a while I usually notice a- subsequent improvement in my ground game . I believe that this is because the balance , timing and strength gained from the practice of wrestling and judo- are perfectly suited to many aspects of jiu jitsu .

@@60349129 @349129/ <h> The One Supplement ALL BJJ Players Should Take <p> This article was written by our- Jiu Jitsu Brotherhood London Instructor , Dr. Marc Barton . Marc is a BJJ brown- belt and one of the UKs most qualified emergency medicine professionals . <p> A few years back I noticed that I was overwhelmingly tired , especially for a day or two after training . At the time I was also working 50 hours a week as an Emergency Medic and I attributed my tiredness to this at first . As the weeks went by I decided to get my bloods checked , just to be safe , and was surprised to find out that my Vitamin D levels were very low and that this was , at least partially , responsible for my tiredness . <p> After doing some further reading I discovered that I was not alone . In fact around 70% of people are deficient in this important vitamin . Despite having been through 6 years of medical school and having worked as a doctor for almost a decade at that point in time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to many of my colleagues about the same thing at work , it seems that many other doctors were also unaware of this at the time . Awareness has improved over recent years though and this does seem to be something that is tested for more frequently now . <p> I have taken Vitamin D almost every day since then , in one form or another . Not only did my tiredness resolve but I have also experienced numerous other benefits . <h> What is Vitamin D ? <p> Vitamin D is not actually a single vitamin but instead a group of five fat-soluble vitamins . In humans Vitamin D3 appears to be the most important of these . Vitamin D is actually considered to be a steroid hormone and plays a very important role in gene expression , controlling the action of over 1,000 genes in the human body . It also controls an enormous variety of vitally important physiological functions . <p> Very few foods contain Vitamin D3 and the major source is UV radiation from exposure to sunlight . The UV radiation converts a type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then converted into a more active form , called 25-hydroxyvitamin D , in the liver . <h> Boost Your Energy Levels <p> A mild lack of Vitamin D often goes unnoticed but is a well-recognised cause of muscle fatigue and general aches and pains . Many grapplers experience these symptoms and simply attribute them to the stresses of training , as I did . <p> One recent study at Newcastle University in the UK demonstrated that good Vitamin D levels are necessary for making muscles work efficiently and can also help to boost energy levels . Vitamin D is thought to do this by enhancing the activity of mitochondria within cells . Mitochondria are essentially the power stations ' of our cells and are responsible for generating the energy needed for them to function properly . <p> The study looked at a group of patients with low Vitamin D levels and symptoms of muscle fatigue . Improving the Vitamin D levels of these patients improved their symptoms of muscle fatigue and their muscle efficiency significantly . <h> Strengthen Your Bones <p> Every grappler needs strong and healthy bones due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D plays a very important role in maintaining healthy bones by promoting calcium absorption from our diet and facilitating healthy bone formation and turnover . <p> A more severe lack of Vitamin D can cause serious problems relating to bone health such as osteomalacia . In osteomalacia the bones become weakened due to reduced density and sufferers frequently experience bone pain . It can also increase the risk of bone fracture and cause deformities of the bones . <h> Increase Testosterone Production and Athletic Performance <p> Vitamin D has been used to improve athletic performance for decades . It has long been accepted that athletes perform better in the summer months . A study on Russian sprinters in the 1930s showed that 100 metre sprint times improved in athletes that were exposed to ultraviolet radiation . Another study in the 1960s demonstrated an improvement in speed , strength and endurance in women treated with a single dose of ultraviolet radiation . <p> Several recent studies have shown that men with good Vitamin D levels also tend to have significantly higher testosterone levels . It is not fully understood why Vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that the are Vitamin D receptors in the testes , where testosterone is produced , and experiments on mice have shown that those without Vitamin D receptors suffer from low testosterone levels . <h> The Ageing Grappler <p> If you , like me , are an older grappler ( I am 40 years young next year ) , then you will almost certainly benefit from Vitamin D supplementation . As we age our body becomes less able to produce Vitamin D from UV light and a 70-year-old produces 4 times less vitamin D from sunlight than a 20-year-old . <p> Vitamin D also plays an important role in offsetting some of the effects of ageing . Each strand of DNA in our bodies is capped by something called a telomere . Telomeres are a little like the cap at the end of a shoelace that protect the shoelace from fraying , but instead of protecting the shoelace they protect DNA strands from damage . As we get older our telomeres shorten and telomere length is considered to be an excellent biological marker of age . Studies have shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In essence this means that people with higher Vitamin D levels are biologically younger than their vitamin D deficient counterparts . <p> The moral of the story is that if you want to still be grappling in your 50s , 60s or even 70s , then it is probably a good idea to make sure you are getting plenty of Vitamin D ! <h> Other Health Benefits <p> Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with a wide variety of diseases including numerous different types of cancer , immune system dysfunction , depression and dementia . There is still much research needed to look into these associations further , but it is clear that Vitamin D plays an essential role in staying healthy . <h> Getting Enough Vitamin D <p> There are numerous reasons why people tend to be low in Vitamin D levels . Most people , very wisely , monitor their exposure to sunlight and wear sun block to reduce the risk of skin cancer . Unfortunately this also prevents the production of Vitamin D in the skin . People with darker skin pigmentation are also less able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a type of natural sun block . <p> The further north that you live the more likely that you are to be Vitamin D deficient . The 37th parallel north is effectively the last point where the skin can produce a meaningful amount of Vitamin D from sunlight , so if you are not taking any vitamin D supplementation and you live further north than this you may well be Vitamin D deficient . The 37th parallel is n't as far north as you would think , it runs through Santa Cruz in California ! <p> Being overweight can also negatively impact your Vitamin D levels . It is a fat-soluble vitamin and as a result is stored in body fat . If you have a large quantity of body fat then this means that more Vitamin D will be stored there and less will be circulating in your blood stream . In effect less Vitamin D will be available to your cells . <p> The best dietary source of Vitamin D is probably oily fish , such as salmon , tuna and mackerel . Vitamin D is also present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be difficult to obtain enough Vitamin D , even if you eat a lot of these foods and the easiest way to ensure that you are getting enough is by taking a Vitamin D supplement . <h> What 's the Right Dose ? <p> The best way to check if you are deficient in Vitamin D is to talk to your doctor about arranging a blood test . I would particularly recommend this if you are experiencing unexplained tiredness , fatigue or any of the other symptoms I have discussed . <p> A dose of 4,000 IUs per day of Vitamin D3 is usually adequate to bring Vitamin D levels back to normal in adults that are deficient . After that a maintenance dose of 1000 to 2000 IUs per day is generally advisable . Your doctor will be able to guide you if you are found to be deficient , as I was . The optimum levels seem to be between 40 and 60 ng/ml and people with these levels appear to be generally healthier , have better energy levels and live longer . <p> The bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seriously thinking about either taking a Vitamin D3 supplement , or getting your levels checked . 181481 @qwx591481 
@@60349137 @349137/ <h> Using Your Mind 's Eye " Visualization for Jiu Jitsu <p> Many of you have probably heard about visualization in sports . It is a technique used by many professional athletes to improve their performance and several scientific studies have proved the efficiency of this method . I started training in jiu-jitsu by myself , having no training partners with whom to try the moves I had learned in seminars . I started using some basic visualization methods out of necessity . Later I read an article about visualization in a martial arts magazine and I realized that I was using a very common technique . <p> I began to use it a lot more and with the proper method . Visualization for jiu jitsu has played a huge part in my progression.Watching sport on TV you have certainly seen an athlete with is eyes closed before action . He was probably visualizing the moves he was about to perform . With visualization you can think about a technique in great detail and visualize yourself performing it perfectly . You are just telling your mind exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in more detail and see how we can use it to improve our jiu-jitsu . <h> How It Works <p> For every movement you make , and for every action you take , the initiation and completion begins and ends with the signals that come from and are sent back to your brain . Since your brain is the central command center for your body , it makes sense that improving the function of your mind also improves your physical capabilities . Visualization is kinesthetic ( how something feels ) . When a person physically performs an action , several areas of the brain are activated . Most of these parts of the brain are activated in the same way whether the person is actually performing the skill or simply imagining it . The brain can hardly tell the difference ! <p> Grappling athlete visualising before a match <p> That 's why visualization is such a powerful technique . You learn that the strength and shape of your body is directly tied to your mind . In this case the mind-body connection requires that you condition your mind first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you to use your muscles . <h> How To Do It <p> Just take a comfortable position , sit down or lie down . Close your eyes and relax your whole body . Then , choose a technique and picture yourself doing it . Imagine yourself within your body rather than looking at yourself from a distance . It is important that your visualization be as vivid and as detailed as possible . Use all of your senses to to make the experience as detailed and vivid as possible . Conceive all the sensations and perceptions of the imagined technique your muscular contractions , your balance , the texture of the gi on your skin , the sounds around you <h> Precautions <p> Only visualize techniques that you know you already do well and with correct form , or it will only help to reinforce incorrect movements and mistakes in your mind .

@@60349157 @349157/ <h> Jiu Jitsu is Meditation <p> We are all consumed by a myriad of worries and responsibilities from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep . These include amongst other things our careers , relationships and finances . Sometimes these concerns even permeate our dreams.But when we are on the mat sparring against a resisting opponent " our thoughts are focused on only one thing and that is the moment . Jiu-jitsu is meditation or at least a form of meditation . In my opinion , this is the reason for the massive global explosion in popularity that it has experienced over the past decade . People start training for the usual reasons e.g. self-defence , fitness etc. and soon become hooked . I believe we are all meditating on the mat and most of us do n't  even know it . Perhaps our minds crave this release from our daily concerns and that is why we find training so enjoyable . <p> Jiu Jitsu Master Rickson Gracie practising meditation <p> Just as there are many stages and levels of traditional meditation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which position we find ourselves in or the technique we are trying to execute . That is our moment . However , it is at the higher levels it becomes far more interesting , as I recently found out.A few days ago I was sparring with one of my instructors . At the beginning of the match , we started moving slowly and cautiously . I initiated an explosive movement and he countered with one of his own . Suddenly the tempo of the match began to rise . For the first few seconds I was running through my decision-trees and accessing my mental database of techniques , but soon the pace was so furious I could no longer do that . For a moment of time " I cant say how long it was , several seconds maybe " I experienced something which affected me profoundly . I cant say exactly what happened . My mind just seemed to switch off and my body just switched to auto pilot . I experienced an overwhelming sense of tranquility and peace " strange considering that ( according to those observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-paced movements continued for several seconds more . <p> The match ended and the mental stillness was lost . I found myself completely drained " so much so that I had to leave the mat . For the next two days all I could think about was what had happened . I tried to put it into words for my flatmate and my girlfriend but I just could n't articulate it . After much discussion with some friends and some research on the internet I feel that the closest word I can find to approximate the experience is Samadhi . <p> From Wikipedia : Samadhi is a Hindu and Buddhist term that describes a non-dualistic state of consciousness in which the consciousness of the experiencing subject becomes one with the experienced object , and in which the mind becomes still ( one-pointed or concentrated ) though the person remains conscious . <p> Perhaps I will never touch that again . But all my training up until this point was worth it just for that one moment . And all my training from now on will be in anticipation of the next one . <p> - 181481 @qwx591481

@@60349225 @349225/ <h> So , You Want to Open Your Own Jiu Jitsu Academy . <p> To many guys who train jiu jitsu , the idea of owning their own successful academy seems like the ultimate dream . Even if it 's not a goal of yours , I 'm sure you 've thought about it . The possibility of quitting the 9-5 and teaching the art full-time is very tempting to almost anyone who truly loves jiu jitsu . <p> But as with almost everything in life , it 's not quite what it appears to be from the outside . I 've seen the progression happen so many times now . It goes something like this : <p> A guy starts training BJJ and falls in love with it . He dedicates himself to earning some medals and his black belt so he can open his own place with his head held high . Through hard work and dedication he achieves both and a few months later rents a space and starts teaching . <p> After the initial excitement of the new project wears off the realities of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit home . Jiu Jitsu has now become his job . Within a couple of years he 's over-worked , burned out on teaching and making barely enough money to survive . Very often he walks away from it all . <p> Starting a jiu jitsu academy puts you in a- strange position your career , hobby and social life all blend into one . You 'll be much more than just a coach . Every successful academy owner has at some point been a teacher , businessman , cleaner , marketer and sometimes even a crisis counsellor. - For some people it 's not what they expected and can be overwhelming . <h> Total Passion &amp; Commitment is Required <p> If you 're considering it , here 's my advice : Make sure you really , really love jiu jitsu . Notice I did n't say like ' or enjoy ' . If you just like or enjoy jiu jitsu and you start your own academy , I doubt you 'll get through the first 24 months . Most people enjoy chocolate cake . But try to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days per week , 50 weeks per year and see how long that lasts . <p> Do n't start your own place unless you have a burning passion for jiu jitsu and know in your bones that teaching it is what you want to do with your life . And prepare yourself for a LOT of hard work . If you think renting a room , rolling out some mats and teaching a few classes per week is the recipe for a lucrative BJJ business- then- you 're in for a few surprises . <p> I 'm not trying to scare you out of it . I believe that when done properly and by the right person , a jiu jitsu academy can be rewarding on so many levels . It can lead to great friendships and a fantastic business network there are few things that will create a tribe of your own faster than having your own popular matspace . Also , a- good jiu jitsu school- benefits not just the owner but the community at large as well . <p> Over the last 15 years I 've started and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of others all over the planet . At this point I am able to tell the difference between those that are thriving and profitable and those that are not pretty quickly . <p> Below are mini-interviews with seven black belt owners of successful BJJ gyms from around the world . If you 're considering opening your own academy , or if you want to improve your existing academy , they are worth checking out . <p> Several forces aligned which showed me it was the right path . - I was coming up on my black belt after 9 years of training , the company I was working for was operating on borrowed time , and my jiu jitsu classes in San Diego had begun attracting people from other academies , without even trying . - The signs were good . - I saw this was an opportunity to become an entrepreneur , and went for it 100%. - That was one of the best decisions I ever made . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> Seeing the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor dominating with the skills you 've shown them is very satisfying . - But seeing the uncoordinated , unathletic , and timid gain authorship over their bodies is even better . - I taught a college class where a few students had never done anything even remotely physical in their lives . - Their personal discoveries of what their bodies were capable of were some of my brightest moments in teaching . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> Most challenges in running a jiu jitsu business have nothing to do with technical riddles towards submitting an opponent . - For example , constantly managing personalities can be difficult . - There 's a lot of passion and energy in this art . - Egos can flare , and students often demand special attention , creating drama . - Expect this . - Certain dynamics repeat themselves , and the first the first time you see them , it can throw you for a loop . - Remain calm . - Be professional , and caring , yet unattached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will lose every student that comes to train with you , so appreciate each moment you have with them . <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> Stay true to your vision . - Jiu Jitsu is a flexible and yielding art that adapts to each age . - There is plenty of room for different approaches , different styles , and different emphasis . - Whatever your particular vision is that motivated you to begin an academy , stick with it and follow through . - Many people will give you advice on how to run things , what you should be doing , what else needs to happen , etc. - Listen , be open minded , but do n't be a hasty about - putting these suggestions into action . - Their opinions cost them nothing to offer are rarely - grounded in any business or real life experience . - You are the one taking the risks . - Follow your own path . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training methods I wanted for myself . I think that 's always the best reason to do anything " to create something that you dream of having for yourself and then sharing it with others . I also felt like coaching was a great way to evolve and solidify my Jiu Jitsu and MMA systems and I was n't wrong , I fall in love and learn something every single day I 'm on the mats . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> The people who let me come on their journey and having them join me on mine . When you see that inward smile , the moment when a students realize they are capable of much more than they thought they were , that 's my fuel every day . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> Jiu Jitsu and MMA are still very rudimentary compared to other sports when it comes to coaching , programs and the day to day running of an academy . There are no mentorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out a lot of stuff on our own , through traveling and making a lot of mistakes over the last 15 years , to be where we are now . <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> Run it as a business , not a hobby . Many people think business is a dirty word . Greed dressed as business is the culprit and there are too many examples of it in the martial arts world . The catch is , that if you do n't treat it like a business , eventually you 'll close and your students wont have anywhere to train . <p> If you understand the core philosophy of running a business successfully , everybody will always win . You need to provide the best product , journey , experience and programs for the student consistently ( The key word here ) , providing the same level of quality and service every single day . That is running a business . A hobby is just being lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was over an hour to travel to the academy that I as training at back then . I had a couple of friends living locally who were really keen to give BJJ a try and I had just been awarded the purple belt so we started training together once a week . The whole thing just organically grew after that . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> I have an absolutely tremendous group of students and training partners . They are genuinely like my extended family and I get to hang out and roll with them 6 days a week . Life does n't  get much better than that right ? <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> Where we are based in Kingston property is expensive and as a consequence hall hire is expensive . I ran the academy at slight loss for the first year or so . Running the finances has been difficult , particularly in the early stages but thankfully things are much better from that perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there I would much rather spend my time on the mats than doing the accounts ! <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> Be patient ! Nothing happens quickly in life and running an academy is no different . Just keep turning up and be consistent . If you put love and attention into running it then things will grow and people will come and train . Also do n't  be disheartened if the classes are quiet to start with . I can remember nights when there were just one or two people training and one night when I put the mats out and ended up just doing yoga on my own . Now sometimes we have over 30 people training and classes 6 days per week . <p> I just wanted to create a place where I could train often . I had n't really thought of it as a business at the time . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students coming to me and saying how jiu-jitsu changed their lives for the better . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> There 's a lot more office work involved than I originally realized , and as a result I 'm not really able to train myself all that often . It 's really not at all what I initially expected . I think I probably had more opportunities to pursue my own training before I opened a dojo . <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> Analyzing yourself objectively is the most critical thing , understanding what you can and ca n't do . When you run your own dojo , no one is going to tell you when you make a mistake . This means it is essential that you have the ability to check yourself and your own work . I 'm not one of the Mendes brothers , for example . There are plenty of things they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , I think there are probably things I can do that they ca n't , too , and I keep that in mind as I move forward . You need to be able to detach yourself a little bit and observe things from a higher perspective . <p> I 've been training jiu-jitsu training since 1992 , and I have lived in the United States and Japan . I have always been training and competing when possible . In 2009 I suffered a motorcycle accident and lost my left arm . This was the personal motivation to make Jiu-Jitsu a lifestyle and source of income . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> I like to teach childrens classes , and self-defense classes . I also like to visit the branches and see the evolution of the students . It makes me realize what needs to be adjusted . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> The hardest thing to have in my gym is the bigger numbers of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is still some fear among women of attending mixed classes . We have have a dedicated women-only class , but the demand is still small . <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> One advice that would give anyone who wants to open a Jiu-Jitsu academy is to be in a state of constant learning , whether through their teachers team , through seminars and courses , competing or through training with other black belts . Jiu-Jitsu is an art of eternal learning . We can always learn and evolve , work on specific aspects of exercise and movement as well as mental control . <p> I never planned to open a jiu jitsu academy it just grew from friends training in my front room . As we out grew progressively bigger spaces the idea formed that a full time place could work the main driving force behind it was generating a group of training partners in my home town . <p> What is the thing you love most about running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with very little awareness and coordination and any real fight IQ and watch them change over the first 12 months into stronger , more coordinated and focused people the difference after only a year is very noticeable in most people and very rewarding to watch . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> The most difficult thing for me was just the day to day logistics of running a business . And its probably the same for all small businesses when they start up making sure all the local government planning is adhered to , making sure legal obligations and taxes are correct and making sure you have all your insurance lined up is all a huge headache but ignore it at your own peril . Unfortunately its not all about the time on the mat , but it is a bonus that after you 've dealt with all the boring stuff , you can enjoy some training to de-stress <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from others mistakes rather than just repeat obvious pitfalls of course finding your own way is rewarding but a lot of time can be saved by observing people that have already walked a path that you want to go down . There will still be plenty of opportunity to do things your own way but its foolish to ignore helpful blueprints to success if they are available . <p> Originally I started coaching because I moved away from my academy and had nowhere to train . Plus being a personal trainer I thought I could do a good job as I was used to interacting with groups of people . But mainly it was so I could keep training because I was hooked on jiu jitsu . <p> What is the thing you love most about running your own academy ? <p> The best thing about running an academy is the potential it brings . We have had some amazing practitioners visit and do seminars and some of them were guys I thought I would never meet . On some days everyone has been a little star-struck . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless . You will hear everyone chatting and having a good time . Sometimes I just like to sit and listen and take it all in . Plus the best thing is when a white belt nearly catches you something you showed him . Watching that new guy progress and find ' his jiu jitsu is best thing ever . <p> What is the thing you find most difficult about having your own academy ? <p> The fact that it 's a full-time job . There 's always something that needs to be done , whether it be administration or repairs to the mats or just general business stuff . Sometimes I feel like I do n't have much time to myself any more . <p> What 's the one piece of advice you 'd offer to a friend who was thinking of opening his own bjj academy ? <p> If you were thinking of opening an academy , rule one is : if you 're not already make sure you become a black belt . You cant produce a black belts unless you 're - one yourself , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And consider sub-letting a space before you get your own building . You wont have extra bills and all the cleaning of the mats etc is done for you . Its easier to teach for 90 mins then leave . 181481
