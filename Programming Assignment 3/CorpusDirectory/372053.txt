You create a Facebook account by filling out the Sign Up form on the Facebook home page , where it asks for your name , email address , password and other personal information . <p> Once you have an account , you can make connections and use Facebook .

This is your Facebook Profile . <p> Many people make the mistake of creating a Facebook ( that is , a personal profile ) to represent a business this is forbidden by Facebooks Terms &amp; Conditions . <p> A Facebook Page ( Page for short ) is the designated type of page on Facebook where a business , band or celebrity can interact with fans and offer custom content . Like a personal profile , a Page has its own URL . Pages do not have friends they have fans . A Fan is anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook Page . <p> Typically , a Page does n't  have an associated email address and password . Instead , Facebook maintains a list of Page Admins , personal Facebook accounts that have permission to manage the Page . When you create a new Page while logged in to Facebook using your personal account , your personal account is automatically designated as a Page Admin . Any Page Admin can add additional Facebook users to also be Page Admins . THIS IS THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR CREATING A PAGE FOR A BUSINESS , to create a Page while logged into Facebook with your personal profile . <h> Business Accounts <p> If you do n't  have a personal Facebook account , you can still create a Page , but you 'll be prompted to create an account so you can login to Facebook . This account does not have a profile , so it has limited capabilities and wo n't work completely with TabSite . Facebook calls these business accounts , and they are not able to create custom named tabs . Facebook does not allow business account logins to work with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by a real personal profile login . See Facebook Documentation . <p> If you created a Business Account tied to your Page , the solution would be to make your personal Facebook account a Fan Page Admin of the fan page on Facebook . <h> How to tell if you have a " business " account <p> Go to Facebook and login to your account . <p> Look in the top blue bar . <p> If you only see Settings and Logout to the right , then you are using a business ( limited ) account , otherwise , you are using a personal account .

 @qwx579876 169861 @qwx579861 169871 @qwx579871 <p> This Smart / mobile friendly url , when used in a post to the wall or any other time when clicked by a person using a mobile phone , directs the viewer to a mobile friendly view of the custom app . Desktop viewers continue to have the same experience of viewing the custom app when they click on the mobile friendly url . <p> WHY A " SMART URL ? " Since Facebook 's iPhone and Android Apps , as well as their mobile version do not incorporate custom tabs into the Page navigation nor show the custom tab content if a wall feed post containing a standard custom tab url is clicked , then mobile users ( which account for over 60% of daily Facebook traffic and growing would normally be left out and have a bad user experience ( Page not found ) . <p> SOLUTION : HOWEVER , with TabSite this is not so ! All TabSite users have access per app to generate a mobile friendly url that can be used to direct traffic to the custom tab . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click , if the user is coming from a mobile device . If they are , we show a mobile friendly version of the tab . If a mobile is not being used , we show the default standard version . <p> INSTRUCTIONS : <p> In the " My App " area you can simply go to the dropdown menu on any app . <p> In the dropdown select the " Get Smart URL " option . <p> This will open the Smart URL box as shown below . Make your selection on where you want desktop viewers to go when they click a Smart URL . The default is Facebook . So if you are not deploying the app on Facebook but on the web , then be sure to change the default to the MicroSite . ( This is a landing tab with your app . ) <p> Option 2 : In the TabSite Manager , when you click to " Publish " an app , you will be given a dialogue box with the Facebook deployment option , the web embed option , and the Smart URL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then copy it . <p> NOTE : When using a Drag N Build app you have sub-pages that can be created and EACH sub-page can have a Smart URL . Access it in the " My Sub-Pages " Drop down selecting " Open / View Pages " . <p> This opens a box with the sub-pages you have created and the dropdown for Page Operations starting with " Options " gives you the " Smart URL " tool . <p> This shows you the mobile friendly url and by simply clicking the " Click here to copy the URL " it will copy the url to your clipboard so you can use in promoting the app . <p> EXAMPLE : <p> This is a problem for hundreds of thousands of company Facebook pages . <p> In fact , not only do the apps and mobile Facebook site not include tab apps in the menu , if a news feed post contains a standard custom tab url ( see image below ) , then mobile users get a " Page Not Found " message and have a bad user experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for Mobile Users <p> Mobile users are shown a " The page you requested was not found " message with the only option being to return to the page they had been on . This means that if pages post a link like this below about their deal or contest and the fan sees the post while on their mobile device and clicks the link , they can not access the contest or promotion ! <p> It works ! It is the destination on Facebook , the difference is that this URL is SMART ! <p> It detects the type of device the user is on and displays a version that the user can see ! <h> TabSite offers users the ability to create a Smart , mobile friendly URL per tab so that users on ANY devices can access your Facebook Page tabs . <p> This Smart , mobile friendly URL , when used in a news feed post , tweets , on your website or blog detects the browser type the visitor is using and then takes the viewer to the correct view , PC or mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users trying to access your app access to it . <p> Simply generate the Smart URL in the TabSite Manager and then post using the Smart , mobile friendly URL . This is available to all TabSite users in the TabSite Manager . When used , TabSite does all the work of showing the tab ! <p> Desktop visitors continue to have the same experience of viewing the custom tab on Facebook or on a microsite ( you select ) when they click on the Smart URL . <p> Find out more about TabSite &amp; sign-up for a FREE 14 Day Trial &gt;&gt; TabSite Plans

Admins then set the date when stage 1 voting ends and the contest moves to stage 2 voting . Finalists for stage 2 are determined by the voting in the general first stage of the contest . Votes do not carry over , they simply start from zero again in Stage 2 . <p> Example : An Admin can set their contest to run for 10 days and have a Finalist Stage voting for the last 7 days where fans come back to vote on the top 5 vote getters who makeup the finalist round . <p> Benefits : <p> Draw visitors back again to your website and/or Facebook Fan Page for repeat visits for stage 1 and stage 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity <p> Narrows entries down from the general entries to a set number of finalists <p> Those with the most votes are rewarded and move to the final round <p> 2 Stage Toggle is available to Premium App users <p> The Voting Options section is the second sub-setting of the App Builder page . It let 's you assign the voting frequency of the app either " once per 24 hour period " ( 24 hours after their last vote ) or " once per contest/stage " . Another option for the page enables you to choose how many votes per contest/stage . All you have to do is key in the quantity you prefer . <p> There are 2 ways to set your voting instruction ; either by writing it into the text area or via your customized image ( Adjust its page position and make sure it is 800 x 310 pixels ) . <p> The last option is the Two-Stage Voting .

This would again be another affinity connection for your Page with that Entrant that links them and increases the score towards them seeing more of your posts in their News Feed . <p> As friends of those who have entered or voted click the links that are shared and come to the app to vote or enter themselves , this then builds further affinity connections as the entrant/voter , and friend of theirs have engaged with your Page , together building a stronger EdgeRank connection triangle ( entrant/voter , friend of entrant voter , and Page ) thus giving both entrant and friend of entrant a stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feed . <p> Using the Comments box plugin per entry encourages posting and when the default " Post to my profile " check remains , this further connects the poster and social networking . <p> 2-stage voting builds another further connection for entrants and voters to return to the page to vote again , and with their next round of voting comes more social sharing and connecting options with your website and/or Facebook Page . <p> So , the circle of connection between a fan.visitor and your business website and/or Facebook Page grows with use of tools like TabSite 's Contest tool .

Upon arrival , the family stayed with relatives . For two ( 2 ) years , Kurt worked three jobs : 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. in construction , 7p.m. to 10 a.m. working for security , and 12 midnight to 6a.m. for another security operation . The only sleep he was able to capture was in between shifts . According to Kurt , " These were sacrifices well worth all my time invested . " Kurt+G-s primary goal at this time was to earn the required dollars that would allow him to provide housing for his family . Eventually , Kurt managed to move his family in to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut back on hours and found a position installing kitchen cabinets . He worked in this job until May 2007 . While on this job , Kurt saw an opportunity for starting a cleaning service . Most of the clients he made cabinets for were private homeowners and were prospects for this type of business venture . <p> Kurt+G-s family members are not new to the cleaning business so he was even more convinced that he would like to open his own business one day . Most of his family members were working with a sub-contractor to a large cleaning business on Guam . Kurt and his wife were responsible for interior cleaning of the house at most times . Kurt+G-s sister also served as the supervisor for that same business . With the combined extensive experience in cleaning and customer service , the idea to start a cleaning business on Guam seemed like the natural choice for Kurt and his family . However , in order to make this dream become a reality , start-up funds were needed . This was something the family was lacking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center ( SBDC ) . At the SBDC , he sought the assistance of Denise Mendiola Hertslet at the Guam Small Business Development Center for advisement and guidance . He signed up for the Microcredit Training Program held at the Guam SBDC . After eight ( 8 ) weeks Kurt successfully completed all the program requirements earning a certificate of completion . With the assistance of the Pacific Islands Microcredit Institute , Bank of Guam , and the support of his peer group members , Kurt was able to receive his first micro-loan and used the funds to purchase equipment and supplies for his business . Kurt+G-s dream came to fruition and officially started his business on July 1 , 2008 . <p> When Kurt was ready to get his business license , the easiest part was choosing the name . Great Cleaning Service has several meanings for the Orichiro family . It means " doing the best you can " and it is also the name of Kurt+G-s daughter " Great Orichiro " . According to Kurt , " I wanted to use my youngest daughter+G-s name on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will name the business +G-Great Service+G- so that it will always remind us to do a " Great job ! " His motto is " Great Cleaning means never stopping until WE feel it+G-s CLEAN " . This is evident in the testimonials that Kurt+G-s customers are more than happy to contribute . According to Kurt , " The owners of the houses that we cleaned never complained about our services because we always do the best work that we can . They trusted us so much that they gave me their house keys so I could come in and clean when there were not home . " <p> Today , Great Cleaning Service has obtained numerous contracts with private homeowners from the northern to the southern areas on the island of Guam . Kurt admits that being in business has its challenges , but he is determined to succeed . Kurt says his new family business is a result of years of hard work and sleepless nights , and that same determination will keep it moving forward .

It is a short-lived internal organ that initially forms when a fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall and finishes its lifecycle as it is expelled out of the mothers body after the birth of the baby . <p> The placenta is indispensible in enabling the fertilized egg to grow into a baby of approximately 3 kg in only 10 months , as it carries out the functions of excretion , metabolism , immunity , respiration and endocrine . These beneficial functions of the placenta have been known around the world for a long time , and the placenta has been highly valued as a nutritional revitalizer or a rejuvenative medicine .

Actually , many patients come to our clinic for these injections . <p> Although in Japan only medical institutes such as clinics or hospitals are allowed to provide patients with these injections , the same effect can be achieved by digesting MD Porcine 100 , a placenta supplement exclusively used by medical institutes , which you can easily take without having to visit any medical institute .

It is guaranteed not to contain any food additives , preservatives or any other components in larger doses .

Use personas in your marketing automation ( email tools ) before you attempt to scale it to social . <p> Amplify when you have your various channels working , you can usesocial media to amplify this content in the right sequence to the right users. - You can- influence the influencers , largely through ad platforms like Facebook and elbow grease on- twitter . <p> Understood properly , social is an amplifier of what you already- have , not a random project you give to a " social media expert " . - Without the vision and supporting content in place , no amount of social tech mastery- will get you where you need to go . In summary , you need GCT ( goals , content , targeting ) , in that order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course. - For certain B2B companies , that might be- LinkedIn . For entertainment and fashion , perhaps Instagram , Pinterest , and YouTube. - For- everyone , definitely do Facebook , as long as you 're not in Russia or China . <p> Who cares which social networks are cool or have X traffic ? - Like a smart hedge fund manager , - allocate your money and time to where you get the best return. - Go into your- Google Analytics to see what 's already converting. - Then throw fuel on the fire . Double up on- what 's working already . <p> For us , we like to at least have Facebook and Google retargeting on , since- you 're catching the people whove come to your site , but did n't  convert . This is a structural- no-brainer that has nothing to do with social media , Facebook pages , or whatever. - Its- increasing the yield of people who you already have. - Beyond that , you can do lookalike audiences on a few of the social networks , but clearly , Facebook- has the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The good news is that you do n't  need any third party tools to do <p> this , nor any external consultants . Facebook and Google have simplified thing in 2015 to allow- even a busy small business owner to do this . <h> What content is most appropriate for ads and what works- best for pages . <p> If its not fit to live on the page organically , then it does n't  deserve to be promoted with- ads. - The idea of " diversification " or spreading content around may be appealing from a " mutual- fund " view. - But unlike in financial markets , you can test to see what 's working on Facebook and- then put more behind it . <p> Warren Buffett said " put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket ! " <p> That said , their systems are getting smarter and smarter at detecting spam . I 'll define spam as an attempt to manipulate the algorithm at the expense of the users- experience . <p> From a search engine standpoint , that 's tricking the engines to rank better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint , it means doing silly things to drive interactions , even though youd- frown upon it as a user yourself . <p> Just because a tactic to trick Facebook may currently work , do n't  assume the loophole will- stay open. - Just like Google says , do what 's in the users best interest and you wo n't get nailed by the- algorithm . <p> Negative feedback occurs in many shapes and sizes : <p> You have 4 types of negative feedback at the post level : hide post , hide all posts , report page as spam , and unlike page. - The ratio of negative feedback to interactions is what- matters , not the gross amount . However , you should keep it to under 0.1% . <p> Youve got negative feedback on ads and groups , but unfortunately , Facebook wont show this to you . So use common sense here and rarely will you be in trouble . Do n't  let- this- happen to you . <p> There is negative feedback ( though it goes by another name ) when you make too manyfriend requests or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use common sense here in not- spamming and you 'll be fine . <p> So do n't  look for a magic elixir to get around the algorithms , unless you- believe in the philosophers stone or rapid weight loss pills . <p> If you start with your business goals admittedly , a plain thing to say , but one that 90% of- businesses and consultants do n't  do you wo n't get in trouble here . <p> But if you 're chasing shortcuts , you might be distracted into optimizing things like- impressions , reach , click-through rate , and so forth . <p> I 'm not saying these metrics do n't  matter just that they 're secondary diagnostics , at best . If you have goals ( at least one per funnel stage : audience , engagement , and conversion ) , then- you have two metrics for each goal : - cost per goal and goal occurrences . <p> So you might have cost per conversion and number of conversions. - Or you 'd have cost per registration and number of registrations. - If you are driving engagement or cant measure conversion easily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view. - If you have an app , you 're looking at cost per install and number of installs. - In short , youd not use a metrics that the CFO ( which may be you ) would n't immediately- understand . <h> With so much data , how do you know- which metrics to look at versus which are a waste of time ? <p> Some people take the approach of collecting as much data as they can ( big companies , - especially ) . - These " big data " people hold- false security- in believing that if some data is good , a lot- of data is excellent . <p> But gathering metrics is not the same as performing analysis and analysis is less powerful- than taking action on it . <p> Its not efficient to fry a fish by boiling the ocean . <p> So use the MAA ( metrics , analysis , action ) framework to whittle this down . Start with a list of the possible actions you can take ( write new blog post , turn off ad , make- new landing page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which youd take such an action ( email open rate low , - conversion rate declines by 20% or more , etc ) <p> And then figure out what data youd need to determine if that condition is true . <p> So you start with the goals/actions and map it back to the data , instead of pouring through- all the data trying to analyze the whole thing. - Its like driving around aimlessly thinking that you 'll know if you 're arrived when you see- it . <p> They convert better and help the system build enough history that you can generate decent- lookalike audiences . <p> - For most people , there are two types of custom audiences email and website . The former is you upload an email list or connecting in your MailChimp account . The latter ( also known as WCA for website custom audiences ) is you dropping a site-wide- pixel , much like what you do with Google Analytics . <p> - Youd create different audiences based on your segmentation and site structure , then split by- time period . <p> One-day audiences perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  have a lot of traffic via email or web , then you 'll have to use interest- targeting or other targets to build these up . <p> If you happen to spend more than $15,000 a month on Facebook ads , you might consider 3rd party- retargeting networks and data providers . <p> Folks like Acxiom and InfoUSA will sell you lists of people by credit score , having just- bought a car , or whatever event. - But get the basics right before venturing into these complex , expensive things . <h> What 's the Value of a Like ? <p> back to a conversion event or something that has monetary value to you . Usually , this means that you have to get the email addresses of these fans so that you can- then see if they converted . <p> Or you have to run ads against fans vs. against non-fans to see what the incremental impact- is knowing there is self-selection bias . <p> These biases are so tricky ( correlation is not causation ) that its usually a futile exercise . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you merely asked them- to , but because they 're already customers . <p> And why would anyone become a fan if they did n't  already know- about you ? <p> - Contest fans are usually garbage , especially if you 're giving away something that has nothing- to do with your business . <h> What about Facebook Video / Video ads ? <p> alignment . We see Facebook usually beat YouTube in CPV ( cost per view ) , though the impact- is not as strong when you strip out custom audiences . <p> Expect to pay a $25 to $30 CPM in the United States , which will- work out to between 10 cents and a dollar per view , depending on your CTR ( click-through- rate ) . - Weve seen funny videos , like Mommy Mobile from Direct Auto , get as low as a nickel . <p> All the same tips we have for organic video posts apply here- you 're just using ads to reach a larger audience : the rest of your fans , email list , best- customers , and website visitors. - So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in video . <p> One note of caution video ads on an audience that 's not a custom- audience is n't likely to convert directly . Weve run some tests with Facebooks help and found- that using video ads in conjunction with dark posts does create an overall lift. - But video ads by themselves- ( without accompanying support mid and- low funnel ) serve more to engage . <p> Even if you have shorter- videos ( since the call to action requires that you get to the end ) , you should n't expect- direct conversions except for impulse products . Facebook says that the impact of video is- driven by the creatives ability to influence a change in behavior , as opposed to enticing- people to click . <p> But do n't  take my word for it. - Run your YouTube and Facebook- video campaigns side by side and let me know what 's working best for you . <h> How many people are listening in- Facebook as opposed to Twitter ? <p> Technically , Facebook and twitter both show impressions- and interactions , - though the names of their metrics might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of fans and followers ) as a proxy for power . But better than easy gamed vanity metrics is engagement . <p> Look at the total number of interactions ( likes , comments , tweets , shares , checkins , etc ) to <p> know who is paying attention. - Impressions are a passive metric someone could have been " shown " a message , but they might- not have " seen " it . <h> What tools are people using in- Facebook ? <p> Of course , youd use TabSite to manage your apps. - And if you 're a big brand , perhaps- you can spring for an enterprise tool like Buddy ( Salesforce ) or Adobe Social , if you 've got- moderation and content calendars . <p> - But for 95% of folks we talk to , - there 's no substitute for actually interacting on the platform . <p> Sure , you can use HootSuite to- schedule/post or Canva to help make images , but you still need to be there interacting . <p> There 's no silver bullet for- great content you just have to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much time do you need to- devote to maintaining your Page ? <p> - Its hard to put a rule of thumb in- place , since it depends on the relative size of your marketing efforts . - But in general , budget at- least an hour a week total to manage social , mainly to amplify your existing content . <p> I 'm not counting operations or- community management , which should be proportionate to support you do in other channels . - Your time in social depends- on : <p> How much content you producemore content means more promotion . <p> The scale of your other marketing efforts , which is a rough proxy for complexity intargeting and product mix . <p> Your relative ROI in Facebook put your time where you get the most bang for thebuck . <p> Pro tip its not how much total time you spend in- social as much as how many times you can iterate ( experiment and test- concepts ) . <p> Instead of spending 2-3 hours trying to do something amazing , a bunch of light touches ( quick- responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually enough. - 60 little touches will make- a bigger impact that " strategic " pondering for an hour though most will disagree- with me here . <h> Share this : <h> Related <h> About Dennis Yu <p> Dennis Yu is the CTO of Blitzmetrics .

Now that I 've been working with smaller businesses going on 5 years that are doing anywhere from $50,000 a year to $2 million a year in revenue , they just do n't  seem to get social media or even know where to begin . Now that social media is on the scene , its almost as if it has thrown them for a HUGE curve ball on how to run many other aspects of their business . Of course , I think it is all for the better . However , what works for the big guys and gals just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketers I feel a responsibility to really make that crystal clear . Thanks again for this information . It is very helpful . = I have to reread it again to fully process all of it . Have a great day ! Amanda

Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources . To produce monofloral honey , beekeepers keep beehives in an area where the bees have access to only one type of flower . In practice , because of the difficulties in containing bees , a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types . Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover , orange blossom , sage , tupelo , buckwheat , fireweed , and sourwood . Some typical European examples include thyme , thistle , heather , acacia , dandelion , sunflower , honeysuckle , and varieties from lime and chestnut trees . In North Africa , such as Egypt , examples include clover , cotton , and citrus ( mainly orange blossoms ) . <p> Honeydew honeyInstead of taking nectar , bees can take honeydew , the sweet secretions of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects .

Germany 's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys , as well as some regions in Bulgaria and Northern California in the USA . In Greece , pine honey ( a type of honeydew honey ) constitutes 60-65% of the annual honey production . Honeydew honey is popular in some areas , but in other areas beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger flavored product . <p> The production of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers . The honey has a much larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys , thus causing dysentery to the bees , resulting in the death of colonies in areas with cold winters . Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas . Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements , as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers .

As of right now $1.12 of that $15 is gone and I still have the 521 post views , but now its saying 293 of those are organic and the remaining 228 are from the paid boost .

I 'm certainly going to keep the Facebook Page up , but they will never get another dime from me . <p> That is such a small , limited sample you note and many variables are left out that you control such as who you targeted .

One Way Communication <p> Social media , by its very definition , is an interactive medium where users engage with one another . One-way communication is a sure way to ensure that the fans gradually fritter away , disinterested . Even if it may not be possible to personally respond to the 1000+ comments that a post attracts , it is easy to simply like the comment , and reply to comments that do deserve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give feedback , post complaints or offer suggestions . The very basics of social communication needs to be met at all times a word of thanks for suggestions , or a communication in the lines of the complaint is being reviewed and the appropriate personnel would contact you via email " is in order . <h> 2 . Posting Primarily Sales Messages <p> Today 's customers have wisened up and see through obvious marketing pitches . A recent Pew Study estimates that 58% of Americans research on a product online before they make a purchase . They primarily seek information on the product , specifically how the product would fulfil their needs , and how the product is more value-for-money compared to competitor products . Businesses who are guilty of using their Facebook page as free real estate to park their ads invariably find their fan base dwindling . <p> Solution : Offer product and brand information through your Facebook pages in easy to digest capsules of information . Use e-books and case studies to highlight product features and benefits . - Be a resource , not just a selly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resourcing from your content and others , 20% more direct sales type posts . <h> 3 . Auto-posting your Twitter Messages <p> Facebook users invariably have Twitter accounts as well , and most users subscribe to companies and people they like through all these channels . Auto-posting the same things from another social media channels may seem to make the marketer 's job easy , but provides their followers with good reasons to stop patronizing the Facebook page ! - Twitter is different than Facebook ! - Posting 140 characters and having your " @ replies " going to your Facebook page is NOT HELPFUL . - Different networks require different types and styles of communication . <p> Solution : Even when communicating the same message , marketers need to customize for the channel , and offer differentiation . In differentiating messages , marketers can leverage the unique style and culture of each different channels . Twitter , for instance , it is best to communicate a link 60-80% of the time or a short and succinct message . The link could actually be to the Facebook page that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , we did say that being to " selly " is a problem . - However , a CTA , call to action does not have to be a pitch to buy ! - Good calls to action that work , according to research data by Dan Zarrella , include actions to " Like " , " Share " , and " comment " . - These are calls to action that can be integrated ! <p> People flock to the social media to interact with friends and do things .

As a young man he had an interest in the martial arts but the occupying Japaneses government banned any martial art practice or instruction . It is probable that he did practice in secret as a teenager because he told this author that when he first started training he and his first teachers would not exchange names due to possible consequences if someone got caught . In 1926 , at the age of 19 , Lee left Korea for Japan where he enrolled in the Law School at Chuo University . We know that during those college years Won Kuk Lee alson enrolled in the Shotokan and studied with the great Karate pioneer Gichen Funakoshi . Sources differ as to what rank Lee attained but most point to 3rd Dan Black Belt . Also , beginning about the same time , Lee traveled around Okinawa , Japan , and China visiting many different martial arts schools including Shaolin Temples in Shanghai and Henan .

His application was turned down and so he applied again only to be rejected again . Finally , after his 3rd attempt ( and partly due to a friendship with Japanese Governor General Abe ) , Lee was granted permission to open and begin teaching a martial arts school . Because of this success in this many later thought that Lee was a Japanese sympathizer . In September of 1944 Won Kuk Lee began teaching his martial art system in the Yung Shin School Gymnasium .

This he did , no doubt , in deference to his teacher , Gichen Funakoski . <p> In 1945 Korea gained its independence and Won Kuk Lee was immediately put on trial for his association with the Japanese . During this time of hardship his Chung Do Kwan was temporarily closed but reopened again when Lee was acquitted a short time later . When the Chung Do Kwan reopened in 1946 Won Kuk Lee became very involved with the Korean National Police in helping rid the country of gangs and organized crime .
