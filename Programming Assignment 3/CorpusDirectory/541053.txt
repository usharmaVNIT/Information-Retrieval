Environmental resiliency is having the capacity to respond , adapt , and thrive under changing conditions . Resiliency includes planning for more severe weather and prolonged heatwaves , for improved health of your residents , and planning for economic strength and diversity . Achieving resiliency requires a plan of action and resources to mitigate the impacts on infrastructure ( e.g. increasing drainage capacity to accommodate increased heavy rain events ) . It also requires a plan of action to address the societal and economic challenges . Communities of color have traditionally been marginalized - race plays a key role in determining your quality of health , environmental safety , income and well-being . They frequently bear a disproportionate share of the burden of environmental degradation and are more vulnerable to climate change impact .

Minimizing exposure of city budgets to the risk of property value fluctuations or development cycles will help cities be better prepared for circumstances beyond normal operations . In addition , socially cohesive and engaged communities are better positioned to respond to natural and economic crises . Planning for regular engagement with residents and businesses , and measuring progress toward goals ( and communicating progress to residents ) will help create a strong network during and after critical weather or environmental events or economic crises .

The House Transportation Omnibus Bill ( HF 861 ) proposes to drastically cut funding for Metro Transit , the largest transit provider in the Twin Cities . After accounting for a proposed fare increase , HF 861 balloons Metro Transits budget deficit to more than $125 million over the next two-year funding cycle . <p> The proposed cuts would result in devastating reductions in local bus and rail service . " If Republicans in the legislature short-change transit , our only alternative will be to shrink the Metro Transit service area and reduce the number of hours the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people who rely on transit to get to work , school and personal activities will pay the biggest price as we reduce service hours , routes and destinations , " said Adam Duininck , chair of the Metropolitan Council , which operates Metro Transit . " To make up a deficit of that size , we will be forced to cut service by 40 percent . The service cut will be bigger if we do n't  pass a fare increase this year , " continued Duininck . <p> The House proposal cuts general fund appropriations to regional transit by $120 million , and completely eliminates state general fund contributions by 2021 . It also divests the state from its previous agreement to pay part of the operating cost of the metros two light rail lines , shifting that funding burden to metro counties . <p> Those counties currently have a joint operating agreement to levy a quarter-cent sales tax to build new transit lines and then pay part of the cost of operating them . Duininck says the $50 million shift will make it almost impossible for the counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state legislature is grabbing local tax dollars that were raised for one purpose and then spending them for another , " said Peter McLaughlin , Hennepin County commissioner and chair of the Counties Transit Improvement Board , which invests in metro area transit projects . " This action is gutting our ability to expand our transit system and meet the regions needs . " <p> Transit advocates and business leaders say cuts on this level will have a ruinous impact on the regions competitive advantage and quality of life . Ridership surveys by Metro Transit find that 80 percent of rides taken on the transit system are by people commuting to work or school . Dramatic cuts to metro area transit will have a direct impact on local businesses that rely on workers to arrive on time , and students who need to get to classes . <p> " We have been urging legislators to enhance our transit system because it brings people to work and attracts talent to our region .

" <p> The cuts will also fall on those who are transit-dependent , as well as those who regularly use the Metro Mobility service for people with disabilities . The House bill did nothing to address a projected shortfall in that program , which has been caused by increasing demand . Currently , 20,000 Minnesotans with disabilities use Metro Mobility . As the regions population ages , ridership on Metro Mobility has grown by 5 to 8 percent a year , and there is no sign it will let up in the future .

Whether its a service like Metro Mobility , or regular route bus service , transit is vital to our community .

Every day residents take nearly 10 million trips , whether its in a car , a bus or train , or by biking or walking . On weekdays , those trips total nearly 70 million miles . <p> The Metropolitan Council is charged under state and federal law with overall planning for the seven-county metro regions transportation system , including highways , transit , aviation , bicycles , and pedestrians . Because efficient movement of people and goods supports a healthy economy , a high-functioning transportation system is essential to a prosperous regional future . <p> The Councils 2040 Transportation Policy Plan details regional transportation goals , plans , and investment priorities to ensure a robust , efficient transportation system as the regions population grows . It responds to the goals and objectives in the metropolitan development guide for the region , Thrive MSP 2040 . <h> Planning and programming involves local elected officials <p> Federal law and regulations require that all communities with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding , have a Metropolitan Planning Organization ( MPO ) to coordinate transportation planning . The Council is the designated MPO for the seven-county Twin Cities area . <p> The Minnesota Legislature established the Transportation Advisory Board ( TAB ) in 1974 to include local elected officials , significant transportation partners , and citizen representatives to advise the Council on the regional transportation planning and funding processes . The 34-member TAB provides formal review of regional and state transportation plans ; solicits , evaluates , and selects projects to receive federal transportation funds ; and conducts public hearings and adopts the regions Transportation Improvement Program . <h> Plan focuses on stewardship of existing system , limited expansion <p> The 2040 Transportation Policy Plan includes policy and investment for the entire regional transportation systemhighways , transit , bicycling , pedestrian infrastructure , freight , and aviation . The plan calls for $84 billion in transportation investment in the seven-county metro area through 2040 : $11 billion for state-owned highways , $42 billion for local transportation ( primarily roads ) , and $31 billion for transit . Funding for highways and transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other uses . <p> The plan acknowledges that the proposed level of funding is insufficient to achieve the transportation goals of Thrive MSP 2040 . It also emphasizes that the Council will work with regional partners to identify additional sources for funding to fulfill the larger vision for transportation in this region . The plan outlines how additional revenues would be spent , if raised . <p> Policies in the plan emphasize stewardship of the existing transportation system . Most of the highway funding will be spent to preserve , maintain , and operate the large existing system . The plan includes multimodal and strategic low-cost , high-return investments that increase access to areas of significant employment , commerce , education , and cultural activity . <p> Transit funding is dedicated to supporting and growing the existing transit system , including regular-route buses and the transitway system of rail and bus rapid transit ( BRT ) . Through 2024 , four additional METRO lines will be built : the METRO Orange Line ( BRT on I-35W south of Minneapolis ) ; the extensions of both the Blue and Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linededicated BRT in the Gateway Corridor .

The A Line will begin passenger service in June 2016 . <p> In addition to the federally required spending for transportation , known in the plan as the Current Revenue Scenario , the plan also includes a broader vision . This Increased Revenue Scenario identifies how the region could spend any additional revenue it might receive through 2040 . <h> Land use and transit connection is key <p> Transit investment shapes and is shaped by local development decisions . The effectiveness of both transit and local development depend not only on transit investment , but also on local action .

Connecting local biking and walking networks to the regional system promotes livability , mobility , and connects people to places . <p> The transportation plan and the Minnesota Department of Transportation 's ( MnDOT ) statewide highway investment plan both emphasize the importance of considering truck freight movement when identifying investments on the highway system . The transportation plan identifies " improving economic vitality " as one of the top five investment prioritization factors to be considered . The Council will continue to work with MnDOT to identify highways or locations of truck freight bottlenecks or related issues affecting the region 's and state 's economic competitiveness . <p> The 2040 Transportation Policy Plan also includes the regional aviation system plan , describing the system and investments planned at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and the eight regional airports . The Council is responsible for reviewing the capital plans and programs of the Metropolitan Airports Commission , as well as community plans and public/private projects for compatibility with regional airports and aviation policies .

@@89799574 @5299574/ <p> Since 2014 , Council research staff have tracked trends and geographic patterns of poverty in the Twin Cities regionin particular , concentrated poverty , which is known to have a potentially negative affect on residents ' economic mobility , health , and overall well-being . Throughout the report , we refer to " poverty " as those with income below 185% of the federal poverty threshold in 2015 . In other words , a family of four with income below $44,875 , or a single adult with an income below $22,352 in 2015 . <p> Recently released American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau offer the latest look at Areas of Concentrated Poverty . Key findings from the new data include : <p> After a four-year plateau following the Great Recession , the region 's overall poverty rate fell slightly for the second consecutive year . <p> Over the past decade , areas of concentrated poverty have expanded in the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul as well as in the suburbs . <p> This growth took place near established concentrated povertyespecially in Saint Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in 2011-2015 . <p> Areas of Concentrated Poverty vary with respect to demographic and housing characteristics ; other than poverty , there is no single characteristic that distinguishes them from the rest of the region or each other . <p> Drilling down : <p> Poverty rates in Minneapolis and Saint Paul ( combined ) are more than double that of the region 's suburban and rural communities ( for example , in 2011-2015 Minneapolis and Saint Paul 's combined poverty rate was 39.2% , compared with that of the region 's suburban and rural areas , 17.4% ) . However , the region 's suburban and rural areas have added many more residents in poverty both by number and by share between 2000 and 2011-2015 ( Figure 2 ) . In fact , the region 's suburban and rural communities had 1.5 times the number of residents in poverty in 2011-2015 ( about 388,000 residents ) compared with Minneapolis and Saint Paul ( about 263,000 residents ) . <p> Between these two time periods , 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 , several cities experienced double-digit increases in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( +11.5% ) , Hopkins ( +11.3% ) , Columbia Heights ( +10.4% ) , Anoka ( +10.3% ) , and North Saint Paul ( +10.0% ) . Yet other cities saw sizeable declines in their share of residents in poverty over this time period , such as Carver ( -11.2% ) , Arden Hills ( -6.2% ) , and Oak Grove ( -6% ) . In 2011-2015 , the cities with the highest shares of residents in poverty were Saint Paul ( 40.8% ) , Brooklyn Center ( 39.5% ) , Columbia Heights ( 39.1% ) , Minneapolis ( 37.9% ) , and Anoka ( 37.3% ) . It 's clear that even in the post-recession years , poverty is present , spreading , and in some cases deepening . <p> Research on concentrated poverty suggests it may have an overarching impact on residentseven those who are not themselves low-incomesuch as reducing potential economic mobility and negatively affecting their overall health and well-being .

@@89799611 @5299611/ <h> Local Planning <p> While your community establishes a unique local vision , it must also reflect the adopted regional policies outlined in the system and policy plans . Local plans contain much greater detail than regional plans by identifying local street connections , neighborhood parks , residential development standards , and phasing of utility extensions and improvements necessary for your individual community . But these local planning efforts tie into the larger regional infrastructure of parks and trail systems , arterial road networks , and wastewater infrastructure . It is the efforts of the 188 cities , townships , and counties together that implement a shared regional vision . <h> Local Comprehensive Plans <p> Minnesota Statute requires certain topic areas to be included in local comprehensive plans . The Local Planning Handbook is organized around these Plan Elements and provides guidance on how to meet requirements within these planning areas .

These Plan Elements are : <p> Resilience <p> Economic Competitiveness <h> Local Plan Reviews <p> Part of our statutory responsibility is to review the local comprehensive plans of local governmental units . Similar to local development applications , the Council must review a plan for completeness before initiating the review process for an update or an amendment . A plan is considered complete when it includes the elements required by statute and contains sufficient information for the Council to conduct its review . The Councils review covers three primary areas : <p> Conformance with metropolitan system plans <p> Consistency with adopted policy plans <p> Compatibilitywith plans of affected and adjacent jurisdictions <p> The minimum requirements sections under each Plan Element provide you with the necessary information to submit a complete plan to the Council for review . <p> If we find that your plan does not conform to our system plans and it either has the potential to have a substantial impact on a metropolitan system or represent a significant departure from a system plan , we can require you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process for plan modifications ( MN Statute 473.175 ) and contesting a requirement for plan modification ( MN Statute 473.866 ) . <h> Technical Assistance <p> We offer several technical assistance programs to communities as part of the 2040 planning cycle .

This is called reserve capacity . <p> SAC is a one-time fee we bill local governments for use of the reserve capacity in the Metropolitan Disposal System . We charge SAC whenever a new property is built or an existing property renovation/remodel causes increased capacity demand .

While local governments focus on planning for their communities , the Council is responsible for regional services that communities need . The two coordinate their efforts by taking part in a process of plan-making , negotiations , and final review of the local plans by the Council . <p> In this process , local communities and the Metropolitan Council are partners in planning for the future . <p> Communities set the vision for their future <p> At least once every 10 years , city councils , town boards , and county boards throughout the region take on a very important job to update their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of how it wants to grow and change how it will develop its land , redevelop older areas , ensure adequate housing , provide roads and sewers , protect natural areas , and meet other community objectives . <h> State law sets stage for comprehensive planning <p> State law requires the Council to create regional plans and policies to guide growth and manage regional systems for transportation , aviation , water resources , and regional parks . The law also requires local governments to update their comprehensive plans . <p> Under the law , the Council reviews local comprehensive plans to ensure they are in accord with the overall framework provided by the regional plans . The review helps determine how a communitys planned actions relate to the interests of the whole region over the long term .

The Census provides a starting point for the Council to develop forecasts of regional and local changes in population and the number of households and jobs looking ahead 10 , 20 , and 30 years . <p> The Council uses this information to update its regional system plans to accommodate the forecasted changes . In May 2014 , the Council adopted the overall development framework , Thrive MSP 2040 . Between December 2014 and April 2015 , the Council adopted updated system plans for regional parks , transportation , and water resources , as well as a policy plan for housing . And in September 2015 , the Council issued System Statements to each of the region 's 188 local jurisdictions .

Sector representatives provide information , technical expertise , and resource referrals to local governments related to developing and implementing local comprehensive plans . <p> The Council 's Local Planning Handbook is a one-stop shop for guidance , information , and technical assistance for communities working to complete their comprehensive plan updates .

When the combined amount of wastewater and clear water exceed the system capacity , untreated wastewater can back up into the basement of buildings or discharge into lakes , streams , wetlands or other areas <p> I/I is costly to communities and utility ratepayers . The large regional pipes ( interceptors ) and wastewater treatment plants are designed for the needs of a growing region . Excessive I/I takes up capacity in the wastewater collection and treatment system intended to accommodate regional growth and increases wastewater treatment costs charged to communities . <p> I/I wastes the regions valuable water resource . Clear water discharged to the wastewater system is removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private property I/I mitigation in the region <p> Upstream of the regional and local systems , there is an estimated 7,500 miles of private service laterals connected to roughly one million private properties .

Based on information from the Water Environment Foundation , one sump pump can add up to 7,200 gallons per day of clear water into the wastewater collection system equivalent to 40 homes worth of typical wastewater use . <h> Grant funding of I/I mitigation <p> In recent years , the State Legislature has approved bonding bills for the purpose of providing grants to municipalities for capital improvements to public infrastructure to reduce I/I . Information on current programs can be found below , or by going to the grant program section . <h> 2017 Municipal I/I Grant Program <p> The State Legislature has approved $3.739M of funding for the purpose of providing grants to municipalities for capital improvements to public infrastructure to reduce I/I . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCES ) manages the program .

The size of the seven-county area it covers and the amount of commercial-industrial tax base shared make the program unique . <p> With the support of the Metropolitan Council , the Minnesota Legislature created the metro area program in 1971 . Tax-base sharing supports the Councils goals of : <p> Promoting orderly and efficient growth . <p> Improving equity . <p> Strengthening economic competitiveness . <p> Encouraging land uses that protect the environment and increase livability . <p> Tax-base sharing spreads the fiscal benefits of commercial-industrial growth no matter where the property exists within the metro area . It reduces large differences in property tax wealth between communities with a lot of commercial-industrial tax base and those with little .

For communities with over 10,000 people , the difference is 5 to 1 with tax-base sharing and 12 to 1 without it . <p> The top 20 net contributors concentrate near major highways and job centers . <h> How It Affects Commercial-Industrial Property <p> Part of a commercial , industrial , or public utility property is taxed at an area-wide rate , and the rest is taxed at the local rate .

@@89799826 @5299826/ <h> Density , Diversity , &amp; Design <p> High-quality and convenient transit depends upon high levels of ridership . High demand for transit depends upon on regional development patterns , real estate markets , and urban design that support transit . <p> Density is critical for the transit system because it concentrates trip origins or destinations so that sharing rides becomes practical as well as economical . A diversity of land uses at destinations means that transit can serve multiple purposes ( employment , shopping , and recreation ) , increasing the systems efficiency and its convenience for transit riders . The design and orientation of buildings and public spaces matters so that walking is not only safe but rewarding . <p> Density &amp; Location <p> The Transit Markets section explains how density , car ownership , and the interconnectedness of the local street system result in different Transit Market Areas . Development density in one location is not likely to significantly change a Transit Market Area . However , density near existing transit service can generally build support for increased frequencies , hours of operation , and amenities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasibility of density varies from community to community . Density in the right locations can help improve transportation options for the region . Additional employment in existing regional job concentrations served by transit , for example , will usually result in higher transit ridership than a project built elsewhere . Similarly , residents of higher-density housing are more likely to use transit if they can easilywalk to transit . <p> Because of the regions significant investments in transitways , the 2040 Transportation Policy Plan ( TPP ) includes new residential density requirements for communities with transitways . Density requirements apply only to areas identified for new development or redevelopment within + mile of a transit station ( or within + mile for Rapid Bus stations like the A Line ) . <p> Density requirements are averages and vary by type of transitway and community designation . These new requirements apply to comprehensive plans due in 2018 . The Transit Station Area Fact Sheet ( forthcoming ) provides more information . <p> Centers of Activity <p> The TPP also includes new policy on activity levels within +-mile of station areas along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jobs , students , and visitors in a station area . The TPP includes a guideline of 7,000 people , jobs , and students . This is a benchmark related to the cost-effectiveness of the transit investment . The Transit Station Area Factsheet ( forthcoming ) explains how to apply this regional policy in local station area plans and comprehensive plans . Many station areas already surpass this threshold , and all communities should plan to eventually reach or surpass this benchmark . <p> A diversity of land uses near transit can make using transit or walking more convenient by serving multiple purposes . Retail and commercial services along a transit riders walking route add value and convenience . The mix of uses will vary depending upon a communitys vision for TOD , market demand , and the availability of tools and resources to implement plans . Planners should consider the following characteristics of land use near transit . <h> Use and Scale <p> Communities should consider the type and scale of uses near transit , and how those uses might change over time . Stores and services along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who walk , bike , or use transit . They also increase the convenience of using transit on a regular basis . For example , transit riders may be able to pick up groceries for that evenings dinner , pick up children from daycare , or meet co-workers after work . Land uses , such as car washes , that do not benefit regular transit riders and people who walk should be located in other parts of the community that are not well-served by transit . <p> Communities should consider what locations are most important for retail and keep in mind that the scale of buildings and uses matter as much as the mix of land uses . Outside of the downtowns , retail uses can not depend solely upon customers using transit and walking . Because of this , smaller-scale uses are better suited to TOD than big-box retail that would require large amounts of surface parking . Regulating the use , scale , and form of development will help ensure that retail contributes to an area becoming more walkable . <h> Vertical Versus Horizontal Mixed Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of land . Vertical uses including housing and businesses bring residents near both transit and local businesses . Residential uses above ground-floor commercial , however , can be difficult to finance . Depending on market conditions , communities may require using ground-floor space for commercial purposes . In other situations , they may require ground-floor space that can be easily adapted to commercial uses if market conditions change . Where retail use is not a priority , communities may only want to ensure that the ground floor has active uses and spaces that are visible from the street ( e.g. , lobbies , waiting areas , etc . ) . <p> Communities should also consider the long-term role of single-story commercial uses . Low-density commercial uses may be future opportunities for multi-story residential , office , or mixed-use buildings . On the other hand , communities may choose to support the development of new stand-alone commercial uses . If this kind of investment is made to catalyze other development , the impact on walkability should be considered <h> Case studies : <p> TOD design principles emphasize the pedestrian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to any area where cities want to minimize the impact of automobiles on the safety and desirability of walking . The most effective results come from applying these principles together , not separately . <h> Sense of Enclosure for Pedestrians <p> One principle is that buildings should create a sense of enclosure for pedestrians . This is similar to the ways that walls create rooms and hallways providing order and a sense of security . To accomplish this , cities can establish minimum and maximum setbacks for new buildings , or they can prescribe " build-to " lines . Where a parcel faces two rights-of-way , the building should face both streets . <p> Buildings should be set back in ways that provide enough room for walking , streetscape , and outdoor furnishings like planters and sidewalk seating . For new development , cities should require that all off-street parking , as well as loading areas , be located behind or to the side of a building . Cities should limit the amount of street frontage that parking uses . Planners should also understand how streets and rights-of-way may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should relate to the street . <h> Uninterrupted Walking Routes <p> Another principle is that site plans for new developments should not conflict with primary walking routes . For the convenience of pedestrians , a building should include a main entrance that fronts , or is closely connected to , the sidewalk . For pedestrian safety , the number of driveways should be minimized and located on secondary streets rather than those designated as primary walking routes . Major building renovations and parking lot reconstruction provide opportunities for cities to apply TOD design principles . <h> Active Ground Floors <p> A third principle is that building uses on the ground floor should be " activated " along walking routes and within commercial districts . Activity on the ground floor of buildings serves a number of related purposes . Pedestrians can benefit from convenient retail or services . Active ground floors create a more visually engaging environment for pedestrians as they walk by . Finally , creating visual links between active ground floor uses and the sidewalk contributes to the safety of the pedestrian who may be alone on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or other spaces that are used for gathering , meeting , or waiting . <h> Site Planning Along Transit <p> If development happens on streets that are served by Metro Transit , cities can consult with Metro Transits Urban Design group for feedback on how site plans might impact bus stops , transit customers , and bus operations ( i.e. , stopping , merging , turning , etc . ) . Metro Transit regularly reviews site plans with the City of Minneapolis , and Metro Transit encourages other cities to consult with us when planning development along transit routes or reviewing development prospects . <h> We Can Help ! <p> Placemaking creates places that attract people and bring residents and visitors together . The building blocks of placemaking include buildings , streets , sidewalks , parks , patios , plazas , as well as activities . Placemaking puts these things together in a way that creates comfortable , engaging , and satisfying environments . Placemaking is part of planning , and it is especially vital for TOD . <h> Placemaking as Investment <p> Placemaking helps attract private investment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and positive experience . People in the market for higher-density development need and expect the access and mobility that transit provides , but are also looking for quality public open space , amenities , and public activity . <h> Placemaking in Different Contexts <p> Cities plan for public spaces in different contexts . This includes reinforcing and retrofitting developed areas , master planning for greenfield or large-scale redevelopment , and making changes in locations that currently have few spaces as public amenities . Planners should evaluate existing conditions and help their cities identify potential improvements to improve the sense of place . This evaluation should address both publicly owned spaces as well as publicly accessible private spaces accessible to the public . <h> Questions for Planners <p> Some of the central questions planners ask about placemaking include : <p> Does the space , or the space created by a development , add value to a location ( e.g. , views , shade , sitting areas ) , and do people feel a sense of pride and ownership in the space ? <p> Is the space functional ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. public events ) , and is it enjoyable to look at ? <p> Is the space used enough to make people feel secure and is it visible from surrounding uses ? <p> Is the space adaptable to changing seasons and different community needs ? <p> Cities plan for public spaces in different circumstances . This includes reinforcing and retrofitting developed areas , master planning for greenfield or large-scale redevelopment , and making changes in locations with few amenities in public spaces .

Five agencies joined the Council as sponsors , and many local stakeholders were involved . Enhanced monitoring and special field studies were conducted during 2004-2006 . The model was developed and tested using extensive data from 1988 and 2001-2006 representing a wide range of river conditions . The Lower Minnesota River Model provides a tool for facility and watershed planning , load allocation studies , and water quality assessments .
