It soon became clear that many other people were hard at work battling the seemingly indestructible clothes moths as many comments after comment started to roll in . <p> After receiving over 100 reader stories about your attempts to get rid of clothes moths I thought I should put some of the collective wisdom together and produce a page of tips for getting rid of clothes moths ( although much of this advice will apply to other types of moths as well ) . <h> Know your enemy <p> Common clothes moths ( tineola bisselliella ) appear in the Spring , Summer and Winter . The larvae which look like white maggots eat your carpets or clothes . You 'll see them crawling in the carpets , up walls , and over your fabrics . They later turn into flying moths . The flying moths do n't cause any direct damage to fabrics , but they can each lay many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and you can soon end up with a very bad infestation . <h> Daily tips to reduce moth numbers <p> If you already have clothes moths you are going to have to work to keep the numbers down . If the infestation is bad this could turn into a war ! <p> Vacuum the carpets regularly . Especially in any areas that you know the moths gather , such as under the bed , in quiet areas of the room , and around the skirting boards . <p> Immediately kill any live moths or larvae that you see . The larvae will eat your clothes and carpets , and the flying moths will lay eggs . Neither is good to have around ! <p> Keep doors , windows and cupboard doors shut . You want to make it difficult for them to move around . <h> Creating a less attractive home for moths <p> If the moths are eating the carpets then either remove the carpets completely , or replace wool carpets with synthetic ones . <p> Fill in small gaps around the walls , floorboards , and cupboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moths have to hide , feed and lay their eggs . <p> Further reduce the number of places that moths can hide themselves or their eggs by keeping your home tidy . They love dark undisturbed areas under the bed , or behind junk that you may leave on the floor . If your home stays uncluttered and clean there are fewer places for them to go . <p> Keep windows shut so the moths ca n't get in . Consider putting an insect screen over windows that you regularly open . <p> Open curtains and let as much natural light into the rooms as possible . Clothes moths seem to prefer it when it is darker . <p> Do n't leave clothes or other natural fabrics in the open unless necessary . <p> Keep the doors of clothing cupboards and wardrobes shut . Ideally they should be sealed shut so that a live moth or larvae ca n't crawl through the gaps . You could make modifications to your wardrobes using rubber strips ( e.g. like the ones for excluding draughts from windows ) so that they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stated in the daily tips . A vacuum cleaner with a rotating brush in the head may be better than a suction only vacuum cleaner at dislodging eggs that are in the carpet . <p> Use direct moth insecticide sprays on the moths or eggs to try to kill them . I 'm not convinced that the consumer poisons are very effective on the clothes moths eggs " they seem fairly indestructible : ( If you do try them the most effective thing seems to be to spray the area , wait a few days and spray again , and then keep repeating . <h> Professional moth extermination options <p> If your moth prevention and elimination attempts are n't working you may have to call in the professionals . This is where you may end up paying big money . <p> First you might want to check in your lease if you or your landlord is responsible for pest problems . If the landlord is responsible for getting rid of pests , and does n't then you may well be able to claim some form of compensation off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might also want to try contacting your local authority to see if they have a free or cheap professional moth extermination option . If not you could end up spending hundreds of pounds or dollars to call someone in . <p> If you do call in the professionals make sure they give you some kind of guarantee that if the moths are n't eliminated they will come back to deal with the problem again . You may well need two or three ( or more ! ) visits . <p> If the infestation is very well established then multiple visits may not be effective . For example if the eggs are deeply embedded in carpets or floorboards then it is unlikely that any professional spraying will get rid of 100% of the eggs . You may need to do something more structural ( removing carpets , filling gaps ) to get rid of them . <h> The nuclear option ! <p> Move out to a new home . You would n't be the first person to abandon a home because of moths . <p> However it you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs to your new place in your clothes and fabrics . Do thoroughly wash and seal all clothes away so you can try to eliminate the chances of transporting them to your new home . <p> And when you arrive at your new home be vigilant for signs of new moths . Deal with them as soon as you see them so they do n't spread . <h> Let us know how you get on <p> There are 150 comments and reader stories on my previous Clothes Moths Attack ! . There is some great reader advice amongst those comments . I 've had to close that post for new comments as it was getting too big !

" <p> Oy ! I am so depressed that no one on this site appears to have fought a successful campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them last fall , but they came back this spring ( possibly they went dormant for the winter , even though it does n't  get that cold here ) . The local pest control people tell me I ( and my elderly cat ) have to move out for 2 days if they spray , so if they have to come back several times , this is going to get really expensive . Like someone else here , I dearly love my one remaining carpet and would really like to keep it ! <p> I might have a situation I can take advantage of here . I 'm moving flat next week and I 'm sure if I wash everything at 60 degrees plus , shake and examine everything I might have a chance of getting rid of them . <p> If there 's any tips anyone can give me , I 'd be most grateful . Thanks . <p> Oh , and if there 's anyone who has a happy ending , please post it up we need to know how you done it ! <p> Its so depressing reading everyones posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of moths and Ive seen a number of them in the past few days . <p> I cleaned and put down diatomaceous earth the first year I saw a lot of moths . ( I live in a house that was new . I think the moths came in through my garage where I had been keeping an old bluebird nest . ) Anyway , after that summer where there were a number of moths and holes in some of my clothing . I cleaned my clothes , my carpets , my drawers ( where a moth flew out ) and put traps around . After that I only saw a few in the summer and one or two in the winter . But after two years of trying to rid myself of them completely , I resorted to drastic measures . <p> I had the carpeting pulled up and installed wood floors upstairs in my house . This cost upwards of $5000 ! ( I live in the States . ) I had an exterminator come in and spray , $400 . I took my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linens and clothes in hot water . <p> After thinking all was well , I went out and bought a small rug for my bedroom . It was a remnant , but new . Yesterday and today I 've seen moths . This time they were downstairs . ( I had only had them upstairs . ) I called the exterminator who inspected the rug and said he did n't  see any signs of the moths there though I still have the rug downstairs . <p> In any event , after spending all that money , emptying out my closets and cleaning just about everything , I 'm still totally depressed and overwhelmed . Maybe the best I can do is keep them at bay . I 'm feeling very defeated . <p> Last week discovered hundreds of larvae under a piece of furniture which had not been moved for some months . Carpet had been eaten away ! Rest of house is also carpeted ( wool ) but when bought about 15 years ago it was " mothproofed " and does n't  appear to have been attacked . Carpet that was attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axminster , and I suspect , being ex-pub dining room , not mothproofed . I vacuumed up all larvae and sprayed insectide on carpet , and put mothballs down , also in every other possible place in the room . Moths flying round the house have virtually disappeared ( what 's their life ? ) , so here 's hoping ! <p> Thought I 'd share my story . Like many people I first realised we had a problem when we came back from holiday a few weeks ago and seen the moths regularly flying at night . I 'd noticed one or two moths before we went away ( end of May ) but did n't  think anything of it . When I came back I found 1 or two moths in my bedroom every day for a few days then realised we must have a problem . <p> We have been having a clear up mission and although we 've found some larvae under the bed and the odd one elsewhere , we have n't found any eggs yet so I 'm not convinced we 've found the source of the problem yet ! <p> Weve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobes ( in process of washing all clothes and cuddly toys at 50 degrees ! ) . We have also let off one of those foggers tonight but apart from an awful smell does n't  seem to have done anything ! We have bought some of the Pro Active C spray and plan to use that next . Any tips on that would be appreciated . <p> Any stories of success would be welcomed although I 've read most of this thread and the previous one and must say I am not optimistic ! Looks like it is maybe going to be a case of managing them and keeping on top of checking clothes , cleaning , moving furniture ! <p> Not sure how helpful this is or if it has been mentioned before but i having complained several times to my landlord about the problem they contacted a pest controller who suggested using ant powder around the room and any dark corners they might lurk . Since i have done this i have noticed a drop in the number of moths i have seen flying around and an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen any of the larvae . I am hoping this is helping to stop the eggs from hatching and the ones that do are being killed immediately and so not laying more eggs . <p> Thanks Kel I will try some powder once I have finished the insectide treatment . <p> I have n't seen any moths flying around since using the fogger on Sunday night . I 've now sprayed round the skirting boards and under edge of carpet with the Pro Active C too . I am a bit frustrated that I still have n't found any eggs though so I 'm not convinced I have found the main problem . <p> I am left wondering if our Divan bed may actually be the source of the problem . It was a fairly expensive bed which has a matress called cashmere which is very soft . I am now panicking that there could be an infestation within the matress or base . How gross ! ! ! <p> Hi , Last night i went to put on my new $500 dollar woolen jumper to go out ( which I had n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck it ) to find two moth holes in the chest ! Arghhhhhh ! ! ! A search of the wardrobe found more holes in other thingsalways the best ones ! .. Theyve got great taste these moths .. I hate them ! <p> Hi guys , having read through most of your very informative posts , I can identify somewhat with your distress having experienced my second moth season . When I say moth season , I mean I have had some luck in that , with a little swatting , and spraying of Rentokil and plain old Raid , I have been lucky enough to experience a completely moth-free Autumn and Winter ( as far as I could see in terms of actual moths flying around ) . That seems to be unusual from the posts I am reading ? Another unusual thing is that I have n't found ANY damage to clothing yet ! That said , I 've yet to do a thorough enough inspection to be able to say that with full confidence . The other thing is , since these moths are light-shy , I 've adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during summer draped over a chair near a very bright window . I take it this might stop the moths attacking them , or has anyone else had any experience with this ? Secondly , I have n't seen any of the eggs or larvae described , but have seen things that look like hanging cobwebs from the ceilings . Could this be them or just plain old spider-webs ? Finally , I have ( synthethic but fluffy ) carpet all over upstairs , which I have not inspected fully yet , as would involve moving heavy furniture . ( I know I 'm sounding lazy here , but I have a VERY busy job , so time has really been an issue ) . One pattern I noticed in the posts I was reading was that with people who had carpets , they seemed to be eating the carpets and NOT the clothes ! From reading the posts , it seems to me , that the moth problem , once it strikes , tends to be virtually impossible to fully eliminate . Since it would be preferrable to most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than expensive designer clothing ( I have an Armani silk jacket and a couple of high grade silk dresses that I do know have remained completely untouched , touch wood ! ) , would it be then reasonable to assume that carpets are actually a GOOD preventative strategy ? ! Would be interested to know your thoughts and experiences on this . And thanks again for all your thoughts and experiences . <p> Bearing the above in mind , what about the idea of a type of mothproof wardrobe conservatory ? ! Could someone experiment with the idea of keeping some typical moth-attracting clothes on rails in a garden or house-extension conservatory ? Surely , if they do n't  like light they would n't go there ? ! Would be really interesting to see how that would pan out ! <p> Hi All , I do n't  think there is any precise science here to our collective moth problems ; ie. what the larvae choose to chomp away at and where , and the cure for complete eradication ( it is an impossible pipedream ? ) . Though general rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely damage will ensue ! I moved into an old Victorian flat with the problem ( which was cleverly concealed during both viewings ! ) and five months , four carpet treatments , cedar/lavendar hangings , Protector C and Zero Moth kller on and , hey presto , my faithful traps are still catching the odd one or two ( is this bad ? ) . Not in their droves mind you , but , for example , where one had met his grizzly end a while back , two more decided to join him this weekend gone ! They seem to be congregating by my front door ( where there is some damage to the berber wool carpet ) , which makes me speculate , are they flying in under the front door from the communal hallway ? Thankfully my landlady has now agreed to rip up the carpet and replace with synthetic throughout the flat , but I ca n't help wondering if this will ( as the post above ponders ) simply cause the moths to flock to where my clothes ( as yet spared ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack my precious rag doll of some 40 years and in a moment of haste ( I regret ) I chucked her out ! ! Also , I have some rather lovely persian rugs throughout my flat that I am hoping , with powder , vacuuming , and thrashing the life out of against a wall , the moths will leave alone . But again once an infestation is established Im guessing that constant inspections &amp; vigilance become the norm . Very very ( VERY ) tediousand I empathise with everyone who is going through similar ! <p> IMPORTANT everyone i have found something that killed them but will have to do tester ( material test ) . i found them about a year ago and tried everything but nothing worked , so i went in the kitchen cupboard got the bleach out and put in a spray bottle ( diluted with water 50/50 ) sprayed all over the carpet as i had nothing to loose and you wo n't believe it , it killed them . i sprayed a couple more times to get any eggs left over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign hip hip finally got the critters hope it helps some of you out and i most also say that the carpet has looked as clean in ages , which was a added bonus <p> That 's fantastic , Martin ! ! ! Isnt it amazing the way , despite all the sophisticated insecticides etc. out there , its very often the simple old things that work ! Am going to try it over the weekend ! And Liz , yes , it really did seem like a common thread going through all the posts that they tend to go for carpet or clothes , not both ( unless I missed a post , but read through most of them ! ) , so I would actually be quite wary now of getting rid of the carpet ! I wonder what anyone else thinks ? <p> Interesting about the bleach Martin ; at least its another " option " to try and we need all we can get ! ! I 've also heard wormword repels clothes moths ; has anyone tried this with any success ? Dee , unfortunately my landlady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is chewed in various spots throughout the flat . She has asked that the day the carpet is ripped up , the pest control company spray around the floorboards , and just generally check for eggs ; a great idea in my opinion . As for my clothes ; I have one built in wardrobe and one pine stand alone wardrobe , plus all my coats are hanging in the hallway in breathable bags . The bags are n't  a complete deterent to moths as they can crawl in through a gap at the top of the bag , but I am going to place a cedar ball in each bag as an added deterent ; makes me feel better at least even if ineffectual ! So far , my coats are all OK , touch wood ! ! I know the larvae can do damage very quickly , but surely if you check , shake , brush clothes and vacuum rugs ( top and underside ) regularly , how is anything going to have enough time to establish itself and wreck havoc ? An article I read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes moth eggs/larvae thrive in different conditions stated that in a dark , undisturbed place moth damage was 90% likely , than the 30% cited where items were left in semi lit conditions . Whereas this is not completely reassuring it goes some way to prove the point that what we should really keep an eye on are items stored in drawers , or simply left undisturbed for a long period in wardrobes rather than those things we are constantly using , washing , moving around.I have a few " test " items of clothing I have left out in the kitchen and as yet no damage to anything . What I do agree with , having scrutinised all the posts here , is for it not to stop your enjoyment of where you live because at the end of the day , not everything I own can be consumed by moth larvae.thank God ! ! <p> Hi I have got larvae appearing on a daily basis in my daughters bedroom which has laminate floor , I am picking them up and flushing them down the toilet every morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not staying in the dark at all , I am also finding them in the centre of the room not corners . I can not work out where they are coming from . I cant find any casings or threads and there is no sign at all from where the eggs are laid , there is carpet outside her room but there is no signs of damage at all . I am completely confused . Any ideas gratefully received . Nikki <p> Well , I first found clothes moths in my home last summer . Found about 50 of them , dead and alive under a pillow in my spare room.I went on a cleaning spree . I washed every article of clothing in my house . Shampooed all the area rugs , couches , cleaned out all the closets , and put everything into space saver bags . I put up a few traps . I had to leave for a couple of months . When I came back , no more moths . Yeah ! ! That lasted from October until Valentines Day . They came back ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and kept catching them . I was getting really depressed about the whole situation . So , finally , in April I broke down and called a pest company . Again , I washed ALL my clothing , linens and cleaned and cleaned . The house got sprayed and I did n't  see everything for two weeks . As soon as I saw another moth I called them in again . Then , I went out and bought some diatomaceous earth and a hand duster . I dusted the shelves in all the closets and under every baseboard in the house . To be honest , I 've never worked so hard in my life because of those stupid things . Its been two months , in prime moth season , and I have n't seen anything since . So , I 'm extremely hopeful . And if they do come back , I 'll be getting sprayed again and again . ( And that from a lady who wont even use bathroom sprays because I hate chemicals that much ) I have n't put anything back in the closets . I 'm living out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up again . But , I have alot of faith in the ( food grade ) diatomaceous earth . I just know I 'm going to win this war <p> I am absolutely close to having a breakdown the thought of larvae crawling around in clothes and elsewhere in the house makes my stomach turn . I have been trying to get rid of them for months now and now luck either ! I have tried everything and now thinking of getting the professionals in . The only problem is that I am worried that I will spend alot of money getting them in and that it wont work . I have done EVERYTHING that everyone has mentioned in the posts and still no joy . I have most of our clothes that were washed at 60C , sitting in black bin bags in our sitting room because I am afraid to put them back in wardrobes . I have n't see any larvae at all which is a bit strange given that I am seeing 5-6 moths every day . I am soooooo sick of this and am close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what this diatomaceous earth is ? I have never heard of it and have no idea where to buy it . Jackie you seem to be the last person that has mentioned this stuff so if you had a few minutes , could you let me know what it is ? Many thanks to everyone for all your help as it is good to know you are not going mad ( especially when your husband tried to convince you that they are flying in funny that I have n't opened the windows in weeks just in case ! ! ! ! ) From one VERY frustrated and depressed moth killer on a mission . <p> Hi Roisin , Diatomaceous earth is a safe powder made of ground up coral which is harmless to pets , children etc but deadly to insects . Some people even eat it to clean out their intestines . Its like razors to insects so it kills them . I got mine at a seed store . There are a few websites that explain about it . Be sure to get the food grade kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bout a little hand duster online , found out how to use it on youtube and did my whole house . Its a little messy but it ca n't hurt . <p> Hi Jacquie , Thats great thanks so much for your help . I have looked it up a bit and was n't sure whether to buy the pest control version or food grade thought the stronger the better , but I do have children so was a bit worried so thanks for clarifying . I will try ANYTHING at this stage . Am also going to try the suggested bleach so will let you all know if this works ! ! ! Still have to find the source of it all though so here 's to weeks of more work and hard slog . Thanks to everyone for their feedback as it really helped me know how to go to war against these pests . Best of luck to everyone and let 's hope some of us win the war : - ) <p> Hi all , I have noticed a number of months in the flat I share with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overreacting as they are harmless ! Anyway , I have swatted them whenever I have seen any and have sprayed under the bed and all over the room . How can I know if this is a proper infestation ? There seem to be a few small and very light coloured moths around . On and off . <p> Hi everybody , I have noticed clothes moths in my apartment for quite a while now , at first I did n't  pay too much attention , and its never seemed like a HUGE problem , but I would see maybe 5 or 6 adult moths on average per week ( sometimes more , sometimes less ) . <p> I did discover some holes in clothing , and a few times I have cleaned out my drawers and vacuumed everything , but not really realizing that this is such a difficult problem to get rid of . I really did n't  worry that much about it . <p> Ive been more diligent about cleaning and the problem has definitely lessened in recent months , but they still pop up every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , here is where I am looking for your help . I am now planning to move in less than 2 months and I 'm terrified that I will somehow transfer these buggers to my new condo . I am throwing out a great deal of my belongings as I have a tendency to hold onto things I do n't  need , and Ive already thrown out a ton of linens and clothing . Ive been cleaning and cleaning every day , and I continue to find larvae in my carpet , its gross and its making me itch just thinking about it . I think that they are living in the carpet more than anywhere else , but of course I ca n't be sure . <p> So what is my best bet here , wash all my clothes in hot water and dry in hot and then seal up until I move into the new place ? I 'm not even taking much furniture with me , but I 'm slightly concerned about my bed as its the only other thing I 'm taking that is fabric and could potentially be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here for a while but came back to say do n't  lose hope ! I seem to be winning the war with the moths at the moment . I steam cleaned my carpet , washed and ironed all of my clothes , soft toys etc etc and was getting really down about it as I kept finding moths flying on a daily basis . I bought insecticide spary online and after spraying under the carpets , round the skirting boards approx 5 weeks ago I have not seen any more moths . I was advised to do a re-spray after about 30 days and have just done this over the last few days . Will keep you posted ! p.s . I never did find the source of the problemalthough I found lots of moth cases under my bed I did not find any visable clusters of eggs . <p> I thought I would share what I have done to get ours under control with only occasional sightings in the past few months . Chemical products alone did not work . In combatting what became an obsessional daily massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vacuum bags and sticky pheromone traps ( and many hours cleaning ) in preference to -1000s as a lifelong Rentokil regular . <p> Our natural fibre clothes in daily use are in resealable freezer bags and labelled . <p> Anything for seasonal storage ( including shoes ) is washed and put in large sealed vacuum bags . You can buy them in Poundland and they 're strong and airtight . <p> 2 ) STEAM CLEAN AND HOOVER I bought a steam mop in Robert Dyas ( -30 ) and mop everywhere after hoovering everywhere as I believe the steam will at least kill larvae , if not eggs and moths . <p> 3 ) STICKY TRAPS Place as many sticky pheromone moth traps as you can face dotted about the house and in wardrobes ( mine bought from ebay " bugbusters " about -1 per trap incl. postage ) . They DO NOT CATCH all moths , some of which will sit 1cm away from the trap without actually going for it , but they 're great for monitoring and some dead moths are better none . <p> 4 ) CHEMICALS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and spent a terrific amount of money putting Rentokil moth killer strips everywhere , only to see moths crawling over them without dying , and the moth population increased overall while we were trying the chemical only route . Similarly we 've had moth balls in every nook and cranny early on ( napthalene ) yet a moth was crawling over a jumper that stank of that horrible mothball smell . However , I wo n't rule out that without the chemicals my problem might be worse and it may be that only the strong moths survive the smell , so I would still recommend use of chemicals but with the sticky traps and isolation . <p> 5 ) SAY NO TO WOOL CARPET My dreams of beautiful Persian rugs have been replaced with a moth free world ( our carpet is synthetic , but I tihnk if you have moths , the carpet really should be the first thing to go as there 's no way of isolating the problem , it can only spread/feed them . Let 's face it , are you really going to be sure to clean under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the key is removing or isolating anything that they might eat . This is preventative by removing their food source , rather than chemicals which just seem to be reactive . Alas they will never go away while they can eat the hair between floorboards etc , but by restricting their food to this , you 'll keep their numbers down . <p> ABOUT OUR PROBLEM I think were " under control " though without moving no thanks to my other half who , despite my battling them daily and him losing a beloved coat and various sweaters , &gt; 1 year later thinks they will magically go away . Anna B , be firm and try and persuade him to support you ! Theyre harmless healthwise , but a nightmare to control once they set in , and from our experience/extensive research if its not a proper infestation now , it only takes a couple of months and you 're swarmed with them . <p> We too moved into an already infested flat . The population was initially very low thanks to all these green plastic killer strips from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresheners , and the population has since ballooned as they 've munched through merino sweaters &amp; cardigans , wool coats and cashmere socks . Landlord denying all responsibility or knowledge . Its a grey area , and fair enough its not negligence on his part as far as I can see I would be more inclined to go after the previous tenants . <p> In summary , I plan to hire out a freezer van for removal to freeze everything we own . Is this wise ? is there a better bet ? <p> We plan to move flat ( we also have a mice visiting regularly , wooly bears and really awful neighbours ) and would like to ensure that we do not bring any moths or wooly bears with us to the new place . Apart from planning to destroy any potential bugs in the new place before we move in , I 'm also thinking along the lines of freezing everything we own to ensure we do n't  being it with us . <p> What do you guys think of hiring out a freezer van and using it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional spraying , but with the benefit that wed get to freeze everything we own to " guarantee " we do n't  reintroduce the problem to the new place . <p> Ive read others here mention the moths moved with them as I am fearing even with clothes isolated , there 's always the risk of eggs stuck to a bag or something which we introduce to the new place ( the ever moth-unhelpful boyfriend suggested theyll magically die anyway when we move . Apparently moths even damage relationships ! I do n't  think Ive ever wanted to punch him more . ) <p> Anyway , I envisage parking it packed and freezing for the recommended 3-4 days with all our stuff in it and then moving in when its moth free . <p> What do you guys think ? my boyfriend thinks its too much effort and borderline crazy , but he s played little part in our battle and he s very good at burying his head in the sand when it comes to " real world " issues . <p> It is a little mad , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? Any reason why it would n't ? My first thought is that freezing might not actually kill them all and that some can " hibernate " . Anyone know ? <p> Can anyone think of any other way to ensure we do n't  bring them with us ? <p> Even if we smoke bomb the removal van , there 's surely a risk that theyll be in a waterproof jacket pocket or something the smoke does n't  penetrate . <p> Also there 's freezing in batches , but then we wont find a freezer big enough for bigger things , and surely with batches you cant get certainty because things could be reinfested . With the van you " sterilise " everything in one go , no risk of reintroduction , surely ? <p> I would really appreciate other peoples thoughts , particularly those who have suffered so understand better the extremeness of lengths I am prepared to go to to rid us of them ! <p> Hi Gemam the Mothslayer ! Hiring a freezer van sounds very extreme and expensive : 0 Youd only need a few to survive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd have moths all over again . I do n't  think there is anyway to guarantee you do n't  bring them with you . <p> Maybe it would be better to spend your effort/money on making your new home unwelcoming to moths by making sure that it has no unnecessary natural fibres , keeping unneeded clothes sealed away , and making sure there are no little holes / dark spaces where they can lay their eggs . <p> So I have come to the realization that I do have some clothes moths but the larvae that I 've primarily been finding is actually from carpet beetles ( at least I think I 'm no professional ) . It seems like they do the same kind of damage and I think are actually often found together . <p> I 'm really not as concerned about my clothes as I am about my furniture " mainly my bed . There are n't  any signs of an infestation but how am I supposed to know for sure ? Does anybody know if carpet beetles infest areas other than carpet ? <p> I have re-read the comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecticide and came across the new comments . I just wanted to say to whoever reads this if you see moths flying around you have a problem I too did n't  think much of it when saw a couple of moths flying around in May and now have a really bad problem . The problem is that once you see the little critters , they are already in doing damage somewhere . I have found holes in clothes and to date have only found one larvae in the casing . As a result of a suggestion from one of the comments above , after weeks of trying everything else , I purchase the diatomaceous earth and whilst I have only used it in one room and the hallway so far , there has been a marked decrease in moths . Its white so looks dreadful on the carpet in hallway but it seems to be working so I do n't  care ! I tackled the spare room properly last week and found holes in the mattress there and since I removed it , I have n't seen another moth in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ! ( If you suspect they are in the mattress lift it up and inspect it properly as I did n't  some weeks ago and regret not doing that now as there are definite holes chewed in the side . No further moths in our bedroom either , so perhaps the diatomaceous earth is the way to go ? ? ? I think hiring the freezer van is a great idea I too would try anything not to bring them with us as we are looking to move and I am so worried about brining everything I would be so tempted to just ditch everything we own at this stage and move its that bad ! ! ! I am definitely seeing less moths and just for the new people this is what I did and hope its helpful : * Forensically Hoovered twice a week used narrow hoover nozzle for under skirting boards and in between cracks in floorboards moved all furniture and made sure to cover every inch of each room <p> *Emptied every stich of clothing we owned from cupboards , wardrobes etc and washed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago and it did n't  seem to work so maybe the washing cycle does n't  stay at 50c long enough ? ? ) <p> *Hoovered every corner of every cabinet , cupboard and wardbrobe to remove any eggs ( still do n't  think have seen any but am doing this anyway ) <p> *Hung the wardbrobe moth strips in every wardrobe *put cedar balls down the bottom of every wardrove <p> *Ironed everything inside and out as this kills every stage of the moth cycle apparently ( I stored washed clothes in bags in the sitting room until I get a chance to iron them ) <p> *Stored all washed and ironed , unworn clothing into vacuum bags <p> *Close all doors at all times to help prevent them moving ( although they can crawl under doors and through the sides it just helps ) <p> Now that my son is back to school I am going to complete the diatomaceous earth process in every room and hopefully this will work but there is a marked reduction in moths since I did all of the above and only see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 every day ! <p> Hi , I 've been reading about all the problems people have been having , so I thought I 'd tell my good story in the hope that it will help someone . We had a bad carpet moth infestation soon after we moved into our flat ( 3 years ago ) . We had lots of moths flying around and finally tracked the problem to the edges of the wool carpets in both bedrooms and the sitting room . There were quite big areas eaten in hidden areas of the carpet . We found loads of white larvae between the carpet gripper and the skirting board . Initially we hoovered all the ones we could find , pulling the carpet up and hoovering the ones attached to it and then disposing of the hoover bag immediately . It seemed to do the trick for a little while then it all started again . So I did some searching online and found this product LONG ... ( I have no connection with this company/website at all . ) We did the hoovering up of the larvae again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooms that were affected . It was a horrid job and took ages . We followed that up with spraying again about three weeks later when we saw a couple of moths . After that we did n't  see any more moths . We did replace the wool carpet in the sitting room for a synthetic one but we still have the wool carpets in the bedrooms . That was almost three years ago and although we check every few months by pulling up the carpet round the edges from the gripper and hoovering any dust out we have n't seen any more moths or larvae . I also sprayed the bottom of our wardrobe and other cupboards with the same spray . <p> The same company I got the spray from also do a clothes moth kit , although I cant tell you anything about that as I did n't  use it . <p> The idea someone said about hiring a freezer van is not so far out . One of the recommended things for toys etc is to put them in a chest freezer for a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the carpet from under the wardrobe , and were spreading around the bed as well . You can imagine our shock when we discovered it . After reading several comments here we tried the bleach and water combination but we also added crystal soda to this mix to be even more deadly . We sprayed this around all effected areas and are monitoring every day if they are coming back or not . Apart from one or two larva here and there we found that it has been effective . Although we also vacuum more often now , but it seems like it worth a try and hoping for the best ! ! I hope this helps ! <p> Hi there , I too have read all these posts with interest and have been suffering a similar plight with moths . Ours have originated from my mums house ( she got them from a sofa upholsterers ) , she gave me a wool blanket and frankly the thought never occurred to me that it may have been infested Anyway , its been about 3 months since we saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around at dusk ( probably seeing about 3 or 4 a night ) and I found a couple in the aforementioned blanket . Since then we have washed everything , curtains , blankets clothes and have had mad hoover all day sessions pulling out furniture . We have thrown out carpets which although had no signs of damage we felt we likely candidates . The effort has been exhausting . Eventually we called the pest controllers and they came and sprayed only once about 3 weeks ago . We saw no moths for at least 2 weeks , then I saw one when reading to the kids at the beginning of this week and since then I have found 2 dead ones laying on beds . So , what to do ? Do we re-spray , or ( this is wishful thinking ) are these dead fellas , just roamers with no mates ? We have bought x2 sets of x10 sticky pheremone traps and have never caught one yet . Why I do n't  know . Also , we have n't come across ANY larvae damage or eggs yet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would be greatly appreciated ! ! <p> Hi , I thought I would check back to advise that I have n't seen a moth in two months now ! I am really worried though because wondering do moths hibernate , or can there be larvae chomping behind the scenes and waiting for spring , to pupate ! ! ! Kind of good news , but just dreaming about a plague of moths hitting the house in the spring when conditions are more favourable . Does anyone know what happens in the winter ? That said it has been mild this winter so far and we have had the heating on so maybe we have got rid of them . Help ! ! ! Thanks . Roisin <p> I have transferred larvae from my home to my daughters London flat she is ok as they only eat MY clothes . A Brora thermal vest which I had frozen for weeks , if not months , had one hole last winter which I stitched after washing and before freezing . I then put it away for the summer in plastic bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cashmere sweater which I wore and left in bedroom has a hole . It is so stressful as the first thing I do before getting dressed is have a look at the front to see if more holes . Freezing and hot washing has not worked for me . <p> I 've found several patches of eaten carpet accompanied by those tell-tale moth cases in a rarely used room . Having done a fair bit off research now , I 'd take the OPs point about filling cracks and crevices around skirting boards aka baseboards very seriously . I think the explanation for ongoing recurrence despite efforts at immaculate cleaning and constant vigilance of our carpets , cupboards and clothes lies here . This image horrified me : <p> I think the pupa primary hide-out is in cracks and crevices in my case , behind the skirting board aka baseboard another factor as to why they have a tendency to eat the carpet around the edge of the room its not JUST about hiding out under furniture for sure , as I 've had carpet eaten from the first 10cm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can hoover the cracks but the problem is ; these boards tend to have abundant space BEHIND them , above and beyond the crack between the skirting board and the floor . So I 'm getting out the caulk gun this weekend to lay a seal of mastic in the gaps between the floor and the skirting boards . Moths aside if these gaps are also the root of chilly draughts , its good for home warmth too : ) <p> Having read up thoroughly on residual poison sprays , bombs and powders , I wont be using them . People havent been finding these solutions are n't  that effective in treating infestations and more worryingly , the poisons used ARE toxic to humans and animals if you dispute this , look further than the claims on the tin and from the supplier the truth is out there . <p> Instead I 'll be slipping on the rubber gloves and shampooing the carpet with a home-made shampoo of soapwort root for the compound " saponin " which is insect toxic/repellant and creates suds with the addition of various essential oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good residue of these will be left in the cleaned carpet to prevent further problems and itll smell good too . <p> Some people rave about diatomaceous earth but there are some health concerns to consider in both distributing this and leaving it laid around my biggest concern is that inhalation can lead to a nasty condition called Silicosis . If the powder is too fine i.e. food grade it probably wo n't do the job of lacerating the insects exo-skeleton . Conversely , the rougher powder pool or insecticide quality brings with it a higher risk of silicosis . Those tiny barbs in the powder that kill the insects also do your lungs no favours whatsoever , so I 'll be ignoring that solution . <p> I like leaving my windows open in summer , so I 've also ordered some net of ebay that is pretty cheap and is attached using a tape akin to sticky back velcro but less snarky in its grip so easier to open and close without tearing the strip pad off the window frame or ripping the net . This particular solution was only -3 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to keep open . And I 'll thoroughly spray the net before I put it up , using a mist of the home-made shampoo I mentioned earlier in this post to deter the little gits from eating their way through the net . <p> If you plan to employ the freezing method , ensure the temperature of your freezer is low enough and the duration of the treatment is long enough : -30 degrees for three or four days . That tidbit of info is from a museum curator here in London who has been dealing with a moth infestation on some priceless museum pieces . <p> So . Good luck to us all ! One London based pest controller says these pests are on the sharp increase as he used to get three or four clothes moth infestation call-outs a month.now he gets three or four a week . And that change is since December 2010 , so quadruple the number of calls in the space of just one year ? ! Pretty alarming . <p> Hi , I 've been keeping an eye on this site as my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began when they bought an antique rug ) . They got a specialist in to sort it . They had certain items of furniture and clothes treated with heat and parts of their house sprayed . This seems to have solved the problem ( we hope ! ) . Apparently lots of clothes moth problems get started when infected clothing is brought into the home new wool clothing etc so a tip is to freeze any new woolly purchases before putting them in the cupboard ! The company they used was called mothsolutions.co.uk . I will update if they see any more moths . <p> I have been battling moths for a couple of years I have replaced wool carpets with synthetic ones but I am not entirely happy with synthetic products and I wonder whether anyone has experienced moths eating sisal natural flooring ? <p> Hi We have similar problem to those listed above . First problem about a year ago , seemed to go away . Back in different room around Christmas , naively thought I 'd treated it and just discovered more in another room Thanks for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I am pregnant and want to avoid any chemical treatments . A google search brought up a company selling a borax based treatment which they claim is not harmful to humans and very successful treating moth , larvae and egg infestations . I have n't seen it mentioned here and wonder if anyones used it or heard of it ? Bloody moths <p> Ugh , I 've been researching clothes moths online today and the results have been pretty depressing ! <p> I 've noticed a couple of moths here and there over the last month or so , and even though I knew they were clothes moths I did n't  think much of it , more fool me . After getting rid of about four moths yesterday then spotting a couple more this morning , I decided to have a look to see what people were saying online which prompted me to get the hoover out . <p> This is the part where I realise that seeing just a few moths around does n't  mean there 's not more I 've upped my moth-death total ( as much as I hate killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their current hang-out was under my bedside table ! I 'm utterly gutted . I found a few larvae , but most of what 's left is webbing and holes in the carpet , joy ! I then moved the little chest of drawers not far from the bedside table and , lo and behold , another couple of bits of webbing . I have n't checked under the bed yet , but I 'm going to wait until my boyfriend is around tomorrow night if its anything like under the bedside table I do n't  know if I could handle it ! <p> Fortunately , as others have mentioned , they do n't  seem to have bothered with any of our clothes . However , since I 'd had some piles of clothing lying out since I moved in at the start of the year waiting for me to " get round " to putting them away ( bad move ) , Ive declared war and am in the midst of washing everything at 50 degrees , and freezing anything else that cant do a hot cycle for 12 hours . Im surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or freeze ! <p> I 'm so sad that these pesky little things have invaded my flat . In my last flat we had carpet beetles for years , but one days worth of finding cloths moths has revealed much more damage than years of carpet beetles , even though they 're apparently harder to get rid of . We thankfully only have carpets in two rooms , but have rugs made of natural fibre too . I 'm hoping that having found a pretty obvious location of where they 're breeding means I 'll be able to keep numbers down , but I have n't even checked the spare room yet ( thanks to turning the bedroom upside down today ) . <p> Anyway , it was helpful to read everyones comments and advice , despite the fact that it sounds like this is going to be a long battle . Best of luck to all with getting rid of the moths ! <p> *****IMPORTANT INFO " A MUST READ***** A good read for those with heavy infestations like me : ( <p> I came across this site about a month ago and wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I too am being attacked by these little f****** ( clothes moths ) . I 've had them in my bedroom for MANY years but it was only recently I found out just how deadly they are ! I never knew these tiny creatures could do so much damage ! ! <p> I have the holes in my carpet ( only : fortunately , they are not attacking my clothes ) and have seen the worms ( larvae ) in the carpet but I just thought my carpet was old and rotting away , lol ! <p> Now that I know what the cause ( of the holes in the carpet ) are , after VERY THOROUGH research ( staying up as late as 7am some nights ! ) , I 've found a perfect solution and very good websites against combatting clothes moths ( and their larvae which is most important for me ! ) <p> PURCHASES : 1 . Boric Acid dust ( very cheap on eBay ) . Most highly rated insecticides contain Boric Acid which is known AND proven to KILL clothes moths ( and their larvae ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bleach etc ) but is generally not considered to be much more toxic than table salt ! 2 . Stapro Insecticide . For use on carpets , upholstery fabrics and hard surfaces . Simply spray on the surface and allow to dry naturally . Contains Cypermethrin ; a synthetic pyrethroid ( pyrethrum/pyrethrin ) which means that it remains effective for longer than organic pyrethrum . Cypermethrin is among the most popular insecticide concentrates used to target ( and KILL ) clothes moths ( and their larvae ) ! 3 . Pure Essential Oils ( has to be pure oil ! ) Ive purchased Lavender ( but you can also get Lavandin which is slighter better because its stronger but they both smell the same apparently ) , Citronella , Eucalyptus , Rosemary , Cedarwood ( Himalayan , good for larvae ) and Vetiver ( previously known as moth root ! ) There are other oils that repel/kill clothes moths eg Pennyroyal , Tansy ( both are good for larvae ) , Peppermint etc but they were either more expensive or harder to source . 4 . Other useful bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when handlng the acid as it can cause irritation to sensitive skin ) . <p> PLAN OF ACTION ( aggregated from my research ) : -Vacuum the room " under furniture , in corners etc . Be sure to empty the bag after use and ( ideally ) use a vacuum with a rotating brush to dislodge the eggs/larvae. -Sprinkle ( lightly ) the boric acid onto the carpet , in cracks/corners etc. -With a hard brush , push the acid into the carpet ( good for those like me who ca n't or do n't  want to get under the carpet ) . Then with a softer brush , brush the carpet back and forth for even spread . -Spray the Stapro Insecticide on the carpet/infected area and leave to dry naturally BEFORE placing furniture back . -DO NOT VACUUM FOR AT LEAST 14 DAYS ( a must do the Stapro Insecticide to function as intended ) . -I will also make my own homemade repellants using the pure essential oils and cotton balls . You can also use cedar chips but I have tons of cotton wool that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong for maximum effect so I would STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST dried leaves , cedar balls/wood or flower bags ( that you can squeeze to refresh the aroma ) , UNLESS a ) you have an essential oil to add to the intensity b ) you have fine sandpaper to sand the cedar balls/wood every now and again . You can either throw the cotton balls in corners , the wardrobe etc or make your own flower bag using additional muslin , cotton or silk and ribbon which you can hang . <p> Ill spray my carpet with the Stapro Insecticide every 2 weeks and use the Boric Acid every 6 months . <p> OTHER INFO -Boric Acid is residual ( lasts 200+ days ) -Stapro Insecticide is non residual ( must be reapplied because it lasts for 14 days max ) -For heavy infestations ( like me ) , professionals tend to treat the infected area with a residual insecticide followed by a non resiudal insecticide for maximum effect ; ) -You wo n't see results for 2-3 months : ( -Clothes moth ONLY appear in LOW Summer/Winter so only open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not applied the above method yet ( still waiting to receive the items in the post ) so there are NO GUARANTEES ! BUT " I have done THOROUGH EXTENSIVE research for A WHOLE MONTH so there is a VERY HIGH probability this will work ! <p> As I have been affected by this for many years without realising the extent of what damage they can cause ( and have been causing ) , I was specifically looking for products that KILL THE EGGS/LARVAE . Flying moths are adults " it is their babies ie larvae that cause the damage ! They are attracted to many things that contain keratin , including UNCLEAN wool ie dusty/unused/dark hidden areas for carpets/rugs or sweat marks/food stains on clothes they are NOT attracted to CLEAN wool or synthetics ! ! <p> The products mentioned above ( in the UK , not 100% certain about the ones in the US ) are PROVEN to kill clothes moths ( and their larvae ) and the essential oils are to repel the f****** ( adults ) from invading my bedroom and laying their offspring in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely smelling room : D <p> Please also note : I own my home ( freeholder ) , I 'm not pregnant and I do n't  have any kids or pets . Some of the above products are harmful to kids , pets and pregnant women so please do your own research first ! <p> Just like the Original Poster ( OP ) said , KNOW YOUR ENEMY ! I know for a fact that I am dealing with clothes moths but you may be infected with another type of moth ie diamondback moths so you will have to do your own inspection and research ! <p> This is a VERY LOW COST method . You really DO NT need to pay big money to get a professional because even though they say they can guarantee success , clearly this is NOT the case ( as seen by the OP 's story plus many others on here/other forums ! ) Plus , you can always seek professional advise online the internet is your friend : ) <p> I have come across a number of threads such as this where sufferers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this DOES NT work for me , I only have MYSELF to blame and at the same time , I would have only spent little to nothing in the process ! Plus , I can use the products for other means eg the oils are known to relieve stress , improve concentration etc ; boric acid can be used to treat yeast and fungal infections , prevention of athletes foot etc so no money wasted " only time and energy ! <p> I would like to add a bit of philosophy to all those in a state of panic . However , before that I want to say that I am thankful for all the internet material . Had I looked online sooner and fully understood the life cycle I could have saved myself much grief ( just starting ) . I took too long to get rid of my grandmothers antique coat and believe it contaminated other things . <p> I believe that the window screens are probably key to preventing reinfestation . <p> Remember that most things which kill pests are poisoness to humans and pets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open windows . I find it leaves a remnant smell on clothes . <p> I have found nothing but suspect that isopropyl alcohol would reduce or destroy eggs and larvae depending on quantity . I would try with a sprayer with windows open and no flames around . You could soak a garment but too risky as far as flammability and smell until it tries . It is both flammable and somewhat toxic so open windows , and make sure no open flames or cigarettes . Chlorine is very toxic , and I believe flammable too . <p> Even most essential oils can be toxic in sufficient quantitymost have phenols . No one has mentioned sage smudging which I believe could work as sage repells . I wonder if other incense might work . Traditionally people washed clothes in hot water and borax . Anyone pregnant or trying to become pregnant should be especially wary of almost everything except steam , soap and hot water ( do your research ) . Better to accept holes than have a miscarriage . <p> Someone brought up ironing which sounds good . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ironically , the sweater that was most eaten is the only one which has been both dry cleaned and washed ( though not in hot water until yesterday ) . <p> I have to put blame on the clothing makers too . I never see womens clothing that is hot water wash whereas most mens clothing is . <p> Now for the part which many will not like : I have always seen holes in my clothes as a condemnation of my greed ( I did n't  know anyone still had wool carpet so this is a different case , but wood floors are always better ) . The Bible says clearly to lay up your treasures in heaven and NOT on earth " where moth and ruin will corrode " . It says to give away your second coat . Most web sites concur that if you have one coat ( or more if frequently worn ) and suits used routinely that the movement will shake off the eggs and larva . When I wore my wool suits daily in a hot humid climate I never got moth holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten holes . I feel pity for someone who gets a hole in a suit they need for work . None for someone who would pay 500 pounds for a sweater . Even cashmere can be had fairly cheaply now . This is just food for thoughtnot to make you feel worse . At least it is not bed-bugs , fleas , or lice which bite humans and which I am terrified of . Or , mice and rats which carry disease and chew holes . I have heard of pets eating clothes too . Maybe we need to learn to take the moths a bit in stride , while doing the best to minimize them . I always thought they are like death and taxes . I will certainly do all I can , with the good advice , to minimize them but have no hopes of eliminating them . I am a bit sad because I just got hooked on wool as it is not flammable and is resistent to dustmites and many other bad things . <p> Hi everyone ! I need so help/advice ! Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -C i have been killing them as they appear but they are increasing , i am now killing up to 5 a night ! ! ! I looked in my second set of drawers the other day and found a few crawling along my clothes ( this set of drawers contain clothes i do n't  wear ) i have decided since seeing them there to get rid of the clothes and drawers themselves which I 'll be doing today ! However i am petrified of what I 'll find ! I hate bugs ! I think I 'll have a nervous break down if i see larvae and eggs ! Last night i came so close to not sleeping in my bedroom because of them but in the end slept in there because i have a baby and sleeping on the sofa would n't have been fair ! But i am disgusted to say the least at these things in my bedroom ! <p> We live in a ground floor flat and my bedroom gets damp and mould in the bad weather , could this be why they are in my bedroom ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clothe damage , the moths are a Cream/gold sort of colour with white near their heads ! What can i do ? I am petrified of investigating this afternoon . Help ! ! X <p> I have the same moths as the above post . They are white shouldered house moths and from what iv read eat all sorts as they are scavengers ! Pet hair , crumbs , dead skin urgh ! allsorts ! I cant find the source but have seenb increasing numbers in my bedroom which means I am now sleeping on the sofa ! ! I 'm terrified to say the least and have spent today filling the gaps around my skirting boards after I poured ant and crawling insect killer down cracks . If I 'm seeing around 5 a day howcome I cant find larvae or eggs ? Could they be under the skirting or floor boards ? ? <p> I have had the same problem managing to get rid of them once only for them to come back again two years later . <p> I used a combination of spray and traps ( i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far have had nearly a hundred adults moths on the trap in less than three weeks . Pretty disgusting . After leaving the problem for too long , and waking up with a clothes moth inside my ear I decided enough was enough ! so this weekend I will try first by cleaning everything thoroughly . I have n't seen any larvae or casings and no clothes eaten either so i suspect they are eating carpet ! Then I will apply the spray and keep putting the pheromone traps to catch the adults before they mate.I guess by previous posts that this wont go away soon , and a sytematic approach over a few months will do the trick . Interestingly when i went to buy the Insectrol three other people were buying clothes moth stuff so clearly i 'm not the only one . ( I live in London by the way ) &gt; hopefully will have a success story to write in the next few weeks . Any do n't  despair , although they are incredibly annoying and bit disgusting to have around , a moth in my ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse effects from that . I figure the only way is up from here ! : ) <p> I 'm addressing this post specially to Rebecca ( March 2nd , 2012 ) who asked if moths eat sisal . Yes , they do in my house , at any rate ! All the edges of my newly-laid sisal flooring ( purchased at great expense shortly before Christmas 2011 ) are in a frayed and chewed-up state . <p> I spent a lot of time last summer and autumn trying to combat those carpet moths . I tried neem oil ( failed ) . I tried chestnuts aka conkers ( failed ) . I tried various peronome traps ( failed ) . In May 2011 , I replaced my sitting room flooring with bamboo . Problems was that there is still some old , possibly infested , carpet underneath a heavy built-in bookcase which I had installed in the room in April 1999 after I moved into this house . Its possible that the moths were already in my house at this stage . The eggs have hatched and moths are emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirting boards . <p> I had the rest of my old moth-eaten wool carpets replaced just before Christmas 2011 . Many people assured me , including the carpet salesman , that my moths would not eat their way through tough , plant-based sisal . In April I was beginning to suspect that the edges of the sisal were looking untidy . By May most of the new sisal floorcovering was frayed at the edges and there were just as many moths in my house as last year . Last week , my significant other and I sealed the gaps between skirting board and sisal with silicone sealant . Please do n't  tell me that the moths will eat their way through this sealant too ! <p> Bit of an update ! We threw out the set of drawer and had a good Hoover ! We had 2 that night , which I 'm guessing we disturbed them ! Did n't  see any for a few nights then saw 2 ! We lifted our mattress and hovered underneath and a few were on my mattress ! ! ! Cringe ! ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway since then weve only had 2 every other night except one night we had 4 ! I still havent found any larvae or eggs , and Ive just cleaned the carpets . I 've noticed the assert edges are looking a little eaten maybe : - <p> anyway i contacted my landlady twice who did n't  get back to me so we are now moving . But how i can i ensure there horrible things do n't  come with us ? As i was packing yesterday i dared to look in a boxunderneath the bed and there was 2 in there , so i am throwing everything underneath in the bed , also throwing everything in the built in cupboard ( just in case ) . I slept in the living room again last night and probably will be until ourmove next week . I cant take it anymore its seriously creeping me out ! <p> But i really do n't  want to take them to the new house , how can i make sure i do n't  take them with us ? <p> Oh i also tried lavender moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! I 've told the other half he can do under the bed the day before we move so they do n't  come out before then ! ! ! <p> here 's an update to last weeks post . I 've sealed the gaps between sisal and skirting board with silicone but those moths are still not beaten ! Myriads of moths have managed to find an exit route through the back of the built-in bookcase in my bedroom and are eating their way through my books ! ! ! ( I found countless larvae cases between the chewed-up pages ; a cleanout last Christmas revealed literally thousands of larvae cases in the documents and papers in my filing cabinet . ) <p> Amazing : the larvae seem to like the paper more than my clothes , which they have n't attacked this year . <p> Well after swatting an average of 2 per evening this week we decided to start an investigation of where they were originating from . To my absolute horror an entire family were living inside my UGG boots which as you know are lined with sheepskin .. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be ordering stronger stuff off the web tonight I am mortified and do n't  think I can face putting my feet inside my lovely boots again . <p> I do n't  know if we have a problem or not ? ! My boyfriend has had a few small holes in the front of a couple of his cotton t-shirts but he is careless and could easily be making these holes himself . We might have one or two or no moths seen in the house of an evening , but that is usually after having the window open until 7-8ish at night . These moths do not all look the same and they tend to sit on a wall until I kill them . Because I was worried about getting a moth problem , I did an incredibly thorough clean and inspection of the house and found 1 live moth hiding in a wicker box I have now got rid of the box , 1 dead moth under a book case , 1 live moth hiding in a picture rail , and 1 dead larvae with casing squashed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no other casings or larvae . What I want to know is does seeing a moth or two in the house in the summer definitely mean you have a problem or are they just coming in looking for somewhere to live and breed , but failing to find anywhere ? <p> This is for Katie . We did all the right things , including spraying and checking all of our clothes . We moved four months ago and thought we had beat the problem . Found a moth on the wall last night . Its a new home so we definitely bought them with us . Im devestated . Hope you have better luck . <p> Jeanne , sorry to hear you 've found another ! If you had brought them with you , would they not have appeared before now ? Well after throwing that box underneath the bed we saw no more and no more when the rest of under the bed was cleared . However when i was packing clothes out of our drawers i found 2 dead moths but no eggs , larvae or live moths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything on a 60- just to be safe . Anyway just nuns a week into our new home and no ( touch wood ) we 've had nothing . I do n't  even open the windows now cause I 'm too afraid ! ! ! ! Every bit of clothing is getting washed before its put away just to be safe . I 'm hoping this is the end . I seriously wont be able to handle it if i see one ! ! <p> Hi , I sympathize completely as we are engaged in a battle to the death ! We have found the best way to kill a moth is to approach it from 90 degrees to the moths body in a direct line and to squash the head or as much of the body as possible . In other words if the moth is on a vertical wall , approach steadily in a horizontal plane from directly behind it . Somehow they do n't  seem to notice you so quickly . Try to avoid gusts of air accompanying your swat . If you miss they have a clever way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may see them there , but they usually start up the wall again pretty soon . <p> 1 ) Kill all you see . 2 ) Get a good vacuum cleaner . Use the crevice tool on ALL carpet edges . Get a hoover with good HEPA filter or similar . You do n't  want to use the hoover as a magic moth egg spreading device do you ? 3 ) The reproductive cycle is fixed , use it to your advantage . Hoover regularly , 100% coverage , with military efficiency . If you become lax , it allows a cycle to complete . Monthly is n't good enough . Think of your house as the Forth bridge , finish hoovering one part , move on , keep hoovering . 4 ) Leave nothing unturned . You need to move EVERY piece of furniture methodically and use the crevice tool where the feet were . There may be eggs here . 5 ) and this is important : on insecticide . Most insecticides are either pyrethrin , or synthetic versions . You should not be afraid of these but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note : moth killer sprays are aerosol , intended for flying insects . Do n't  bother just kill ones you see with a newspaper or swat . <p> moths can be killed by any pyrethrin or synthetic pyrethrin . They all work . Choose your insecticide carefully . I had incredible success with insecticides meant for household fleas . The main reason : application . The flea sprays are intended for carpet in hand pump sprays . Deltamethrin is extremely powerful yet ( largely ) safe for humans , and remains active for some days or weeks so has a lasting protective effect which I can confirm having seen dying/dead moths days after application use sparingly at known moth locations , as you would for fleas . Follow instructions . Permethrin is available as a " shake n vac " style flea powder , almost a sand consistency . Useful too . Research your moth type , research insecticides . Research everything . Knowledge is power . <p> 6 ) You can beat them . Its all about being methodical , efficient and dedicated . Do n't  give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cranny of our house last year . This spring I have already seen a few moths . I doubt the effectiveness of diatomaceous earth . One pest controller told me about Dione . I have not tried it yet . The problem with most of the chemicals including moth balls is that they are harmful to human health and will eventually end up killing you too . Breathing in DE is bad too . Are you guys wearing masks when spreading it ? Just a dreadful problem ! <p> I too am fighting these nasty creatures . I am so upset and stressed by this that I do n't  have the words for it.I just want my house back . A pest company said they can do a combination of a heat pod ( where they heat your suspect furniture up ) and spraying . They also do a heat treatment in which they heat up the entire house . Has anyone used this method ? I notice no one has mentioned using their dryer to heat them up as several companies said this should keep them out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything through the dryer to see if it works <p> Hi . This weekend I too have discovered we have a problem with clothes moths . Not had any flying about only 2 which i have killed , but discovered casings/larvea and eaten carpet under a large wardrobe in the bedroom . We pulled out all the furniture in our bedroom and inspected our clothing ( which does n't  appear to have been touched ) and have hoovered , steam cleaned all along the skirting boards bottoms and washed the insides of wardrobes etc and as well as cleaning with bleach then have sprayed Insectrol all along the skirts and crevices carpet area . Can anyone advise if the casings are generally where the eggs have been laid ? I think they are the casemaking kind as casings appear to habe karvea inside . Found the odd casing behind my wardrobe but no damage to carpet . I am so bamboozled by all the posts and info out there and feel so upset about it all I ca n't stop crying about it . I plan to repeat the process in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day off I get cleaning and spraying as a method of prevention . : - ( <p> Hi Suzie , That sounds like a good plan . I 'd definitely spray it into the wardrobe and any cupboards in the bedroom though aswell . I would n't be sure about the casings being where the eggs have laid . to be honest I have n't a clue . Sorry to hear you 're so upset but Im relieved in one sense to hear that someone is as bamboozled and upset as I am about it . I 'm completely bamboozled and upset too . I thought I was the only one . They may not appear to have touched your clothes but I would put as much as you can thru the dryer as a precaution . Put them into bin bags first though.if you do n't  have a dryer do it in the launderette not someone elses house or you may be giving them a present of it . I 'm on a day off today and I have all my clothes going through the dryer as we speak . However I 'm convinced there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging onto this . There has to be a way . Well the beat the little feckers yet ! <p> SARAH post no. 37 from Feb 2012 , did mothsolutions.com work for your parents in eradicating the moths ? If so what treatment did they go through and how much ? <p> MARTIN post no.13 from July 2011 Is the bleach method still proved successful over time ? <p> SAM IN LONDON , UK post no.41 from April 2012 Is your borax powder approach working ? I have small kids at home but will be happy to give that a go st places they def do n't  get to eg. Behind furniture pushing the powder under the skirting boards That would be a lower preference approach though as I know borax is pretty toxic . <p> IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE THAT HAS USED RENTOKIL AND CAN GIVE TESTIMONIALS on THEIR EFFECTIVENESD ? They tell me that they will apply a heavy spray which will go through to down to under skirting board , and go all the way to the back of the carpet to kill the larvae there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through ? ? ? Or can recommend one you used which did the job in eradication ( not just keep them to a low number ? ) <p> I have small kids at home , and the on-going spraying , micro inspection , and everything else that goes with it ( as all sufferers will know ) is really wearing me out . <p> I guess we do have to remember that they are a nuisance and causes damages , but they do n't  harm us . <p> Some success at last ! Just to let you all know that the dryer definitely works . It kills all stages of the moth I 've discovered . I put all clothes , bedclothes , pillows , duvets , curtains , cushions , hats , bags ( literally anything i could put in it ) through the dryer a number of weeks ago and it has managed to get rid of them from all fabrics . I 'm now storing them all in vac packed bags or tightly sealed boxes for now until I 'm sure they 're all gone.Doing that alone has substantially reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics are safe : ) <p> I 've had a few clothes moth problems , and I use k-Orthin WG250 spray a heavy infestation and then 12 weeks later with light infestation amounts , it does n't  target eggs or moth it self its targeting the grub to break the life cycle , on the bottle of k-orthrin it say it lasts upto 12 weeks so you could be running of 24 weeks of pesticide protecting your carpet hope this help , , , Danny <p> Yes I also think this is the problem I have been having for the last 15mths : - ( its now taking over my life COMPLETELY I 'm constantly cleaning from 1 room to the other n back again .. I find they like water to breed or move there eggs . I have also been havin medical problems that started about same time . I have been ADMITTED to a physic ward Feb this year due to how irritated I got having bugs under skin .. They did n't  find anything whilst I was in Hostpital for a total of 5 days , yet did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have an answer . Since I 've tried a few times to get anyone to notice what I am noticing on me and around my home , without ANY luck .. I do have worms in my carpet , walls n wooden areas . I find bunches of hair in dark corners , there is always a BAD odor either around where I am or coming from me . My scalp is the worst , 15mths ago I had BEAUTIFUL bum length blonde hair never had a problems with scalp or hair b4 this . I now have what looks like 1 side of scalp is tangling into a clump at the skin , it has only gotten worse . Started as a hair thin pimple like mark on bac of my neck . I also get dizzy spell , lack of breath , headaches , muscle aches , cramps , chiils , nerve spasms that mainly on my right side starting from the neck all the way to my feet . Mouth alcers that I did n't  realise that I had till 3 days ago ( bout 2-3mths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ONE DAY NO PAINKILLERS ) the areas where tooth used to be are filling up with this RANK AS white cream like liquid , that I find myself spitting out . I cant take this anymore , I do n't  know where to go for help as Im affraid that ill end up where I was , not that I do n't  think I have any issues in life . I just know what I 'm experiencing are real true symptoms and not something I 'm making up for attention or anything of the sought . Please anyone that been thru this or no of anything about the symptoms Ive mentioned PLEASE let me no what I can do .. <p> 1.5 years on since my last post , and the moth infestation has definitely decreased significantly since using my homemade approach ! =D They have n't completely gone , but in comparison to how it was before , it is a MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT ! I only have a few flying around whereas before , it was like a stampede ! ! : ( <p> PS : I 'm moving house in Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around the house no carpet whatsoever lol <p> I 'm 28 years old and lived in my family home all my life ! We sold our house after a family member passed and my siblings are older then I so it was the right time to move . I did n't  move coz of the moths lol , I 'm only getting older and cant live with my family forever . <p> PS : Alot of wool carpets now come with a guarantee against moths and I went to a carpet store and they said that carpets now a days , wool carpets do n't  have the issue they once had before with moths so hopefully this issue has been dealt with forever ! <p> Hello All , massive issue with moths in carpet and clothes at my parents house where I am currently living with hubby before we move into our own place . We 've had pest control in twice but I am still finding evidence of moths e.g. carpet eaten , larvae , eggs , white powdery substance on clothes , holes on clothes and little silver or gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to paint rooms and skirting boards and the hallway and then replace some wool carpet with laminate and other wool carpet with new synthetic carpet . I 'm desperate to be rid of them , it has taken over my life and I really do n't  want to take them to my new home . More importantly I have elderly ( 80+ ) parents and hate seeing them go through the this . Has anyone succeeded and how long does it take before you know for sure ? Will the eggs go if the carpet goes ? I feel like getting rid of everything I own and starting all over again . I hate this <p> Do n't  get mad at moths get even with the appliance of science . The life cycle of your particular moth will help you schedule a successful campaign without introducing seriously negative toxins into your life , or unnecessary work . See the link at the end to help you understand why one-off treatments are expensive and unlikely to work given the life cycle of some stages up to 2 years and some can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesticides , hence the mixed reports re their effectiveness . <p> You 'll find they like undisturbed areas like under the edges of carpets and in floorboard cracks under carpets which is why they keep appearing . <p> Flea spray is worth considering for under carpet as it lasts well , kills the eggs and larvae which do the damage and the toxic fumes will be mostly covered by putting the carpet back . <p> A steamer , ironing or a clothes dryer should help treat clothes . Freezing for 3 days takes longer . <p> Sunlight causes larvae to drop off so line drying is great if you can . <p> Keep clothes and carpets clean . <p> Pare down your wardrobe to lessen the work or store seaonal clothes in vacuum sealed bags . <p> Bash clothes around on their hangers in the wardrobe every of week or two to disturb/kill egg laying female moths . <p> And hoover + turn the mattress regularly . <p> Reduce humidity which they like including sweat . <p> Spray under/behind things hard to move . <p> Scented oils like cedar are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite expert opinion against them , I do use sticky traps they only kill the males , but less breeding helps reduce numbers and catching one helps you spot another outbreak earlier so you can nip it in the bud . <p> Net windows when open to prevent more coming in or you will be back at square one . <p> Finally , as a bit of a clothesaholic , I sympathise with the feelings of upset and frustration when your investment in sartorial elegance is threatened or destroyed . However I realised that these feelings were draining , which in reduced my energy levels for dealing with the problem . Now I think of them as little creatures that are not known for carrying noxious diseases , nor do they bite people , so try not to wind up to full mosquito alert stage if you do spot them . Trust that , over time , you will reduce , then eliminate them . I 'm down to one every fortnight if I slack off in the hoovering department and if I am vigilant , none at all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned heat treatment . Put a Google search in for heat pest control for moths and you will see a number of companies that will heat your whole house ( after removing wax candles etc. ) to the mid 50-s centigrade for several hours and that apparently gets rid of everything living , including moths in all stages from eggs to adults . Its probably expensive and my hubby wont consider it until he hears some independent testimonials that it works . Sounds brilliant to me , though , because our house is stuffed full of clutter and very grubby and I do n't  have time to sort it out . <p> Mind you , it does seem to me that its better to leave them a food source like dust and hairs on the carpet than force them to seek out your clothes . My most precious clothes are hanging in doorways and are generally unaffected as they are brushed aside like a bead curtain to get in and out of bedrooms . All except my precious , self designed Cape which I knitted for myself over about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest success I think has been through using my steam generator iron on the edges of the carpets . Its far more powerful than a steam floor cleaner and I 'm not sure it matters if you leave the carpet slightly damp for a while if you 've just killed everything off . <p> So has anyone heat treated their house ? I know some hotels do it regularly to stay clear of bed bugs but I 'd love to know if it works in a house because this is a treatment which does n't  require you empty all your cupboards and clean manically first ! <p> The clothes moth are a horrible pest but I have managed to reduce an infestation massively remove all carpets and rugs because they have definitely invaded them they like dirty places with skin cell and hairs and oil from animals and people . I have been using a parasite to get rid of them the trichogramma wasp is a tiny parasite that attacks the moth and the most important stage the egg . The trichogramma lay their own eggs inside the moth eggs and eradicate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found re : clothes moths is confusing . We have them , they came into our home via a wool rug from Goodwill 2 years ago . One online info source says that they tend to stay in the room that was originally infected . We have them in every room in our place ! Online info says that you rarely see them . We see them every day , flying , on drapes , on the floor . Online info says that they avoid light . Ours do n't  hang out around lights but they DO fly over and under them with no hesitation . Online info says theyll eat cotton or wont eat it , depending on the web site . Online info says the larvae will eat wool , period , or that theyll only eat dirty clothing . We have traps that catch them , so they ARE webbing moths , small , golden brown . Were going nuts , wish we could find consistent information ! <p> We have them . They 're in our carpet near the front door . I have no idea where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping out of the carpet . Its the stuff of nightmares . I cant relax because our flat is pretty much entirely carpeted , barring the kitchen and bathroom . We cant put floorboards down because of the noise concern for our neighbours below . <p> Ive been hoovering the little gits like mad , but I 'm getting stressed . I feel like were going to need to call rentokil , but I heard their rates are really high . ; ; <p> We thought we had got rid of the moths over winter , but there was the occasional adult moth on the walls every few weeks , and now the weather is warmer they seem to be coming out of the woodwork . Here are all the things we did which reduced them . You seem to have to do them all , not just one or two , and regularly , to get the reduction in numbers . <p> The most important thing is to work out where they breed . Then I steam clean those areas , up to now very few weeks . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of catching them at the egg or larval stage . <p> I also put down some fine woollen rags of a pullover they seem to like to lay eggs in . I have two sets of two rags each . Every weekend I swap the ones in the freezer for the ones in their breeding areas . The rags do accumulate larvae and pupal cocoons which I shake out in the garden once the rags have been frozen . <p> We have an electronic bug zapper ( like a small tennis racket ) which kills them on contact . If they rest on the flat bit of walls you can put the zapper completely over them then move the edge until they panic , jump up and get fried . You must make either put the bodies straight outside or make sure there are real sparks as otherwise they are only stunned and recover to fly off . The males fly and it is those which tend to rest high on walls . The females only hop , so you would expect to capture them on the floor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are about 2 ? x 5 ? sticky strips laced with female pheromone , so trap only the males . They must be replaced every 8-10 weeks . There are other makes we use , but these are the only ones that seem to catch large numbers of male moths . <p> There is one a the bottom of a large insect electronic trap , and that seems to help it to kill a lot of ( presumably male ) moths . <p> Moths in flight are tricky because the electronic zapper is never quite to hand , so if you go get it you lose sight of them . The best solution is to steel and train yourself to cup your hands around them then kill them with finger pressure . I 'm not fully steeled and trained , but my wife is getting the hang of it . <p> We got rid of an old carpet in the cupboard under the stairs , which was almost certainly their initial breeding ground . <p> In the clothes ) cupboard we use transflufthrin sachets ( one per half cubic metre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an indicator on them when says " End " when they must be replaced . <p> The trick seems to be to keep at it , steam cleaning the breeding places every week or so , and if the moth numbers are not well down the following day , then searching for a further breeding place . The good news is there are sometimes places you would expect them to breed where they do n't  . <p> Its a shame we really thought we had got rid of the moths over autumn and winter , but we relaxed too much and now have to do it all over again . This time we will keep going for two years ! ! <p> We 've had clothes moths in our place for over a year , and think they came in with a wool rug that we bought at a thrift store . Weve thrown out rugs , cleaned , vacuumed , washed clothes and put them into sealed bags , everything , yet still have them . Moth traps ( five for about $60 , good for three months ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all makes enter them and the cycle continues . Traps put out in winter were a waste of money , not a single moth went into them then . An exterminator wanted $1,200 to spray our place , providing that we do 99% of the prep work , with no guarantee that it would work . No thanks ! here 's the odd thing we have n't found larvae , and we have n't seen any damage to fabric items ! Has anyone else experienced this ? Someone told us that they can live off hair and other things that are on the floor , behind baseboards , etc . <p> I have been living with these since February or March and its left me really depressed . I hate having to come back to my room , knowing there 's always gon na be some around , flying around or sitting on the walls . <p> I 've vaccumed the carpets which has many patches where its eaten . I 've saturated the carpet with spray , used Rentokil powder twice and it really does n't  seem to make a difference . <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , the other had about 10 after a three or four weeks . Put one outside my door and one day later it had about as much the one in my room , with about 8 or 9 trapped on it . <p> It feels like they follow me around which is super depressing . Like I started seeing some at work-I work in retail- and a different type of bigger moth there as well . <p> I just went in my wardrobe as I was packing up in preparation for moving and there were two dead ones at the bottom of a box which is crushing as I thought maybe my clothes were safe so moving would probably solve everything . But now I 'm really worried if I move theyll just follow me . Put up another two traps , one in the wardrobe and one just near it to try and catch any more . <p> I wish i 'd never moved into this place because I ca n't cope . I 'd never had to worry about moths before moving here and now they control my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products which are n't  proving effective , in fact they 're probably having more effect on my health with all the chemicals I 'm breathing in . <p> I 've had enough , its really draining and it makes feel like I 'm crazy . I 'm paying rent to live in a place I dread coming back to . It really sucks and I feel helpless . I do n't  eat properly and once I 'm in my room I hardly leave it out of fear that ill let more into my room , and I do n't  want to see the ones in the hallway and kitchen . It makes me feel alone but least I know lots of other people are facing this battle . <p> Well I just bought greenWay moth trap that captures both Male and female , let 's see how it works ! I also use Lavender oil sprinkled all over in areas like closet , bathroom , beds , corners and I also use a spray mixed with water and for ever one up of water ten drops of lavender do the trick . I also am using Cloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid free ) Cloves in every linen drawer/bag along with lavender sachets , moth away sachets from bed bath and beyond . <p> I plan on mopping with 50/50 water bleach as mentioned above and also apple cider vinegar . <p> I have noticed I need moth traps because although my clothes are not full of holes I am now seeing the stitching is now being attacked ! Could it be the clothes smell of strong herbs but the stiching maybe less scented ? ? so they hide inbetween fabric and double layer where scent may be harder to penetrate ? ? and the moths eat away at the stitching ? ? Clever little BUGS ! Well they are unraveling my husbands boxers , my bras and under shirts mainly . Ill be waiting on my Greenway traps and will update ! I have diatomaceous earth but just am not sure I want to use that . I have a steamer too so will be steaming walls as they have spun little cocoons in one side of the bedroom wall . So tired ! ! <p> It sounds like so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like you all , i have the same infestation in my 50/50 wool carpet , and it has just tonight been taken away , but to my suprise the room smelled worse , its very strong , i wonder if it is the emergency smell or something , idk , I will try mop the floor with bleach and see it the smell goes away . I have a horrible feeling that they may be nesting in my leather sofa , as it reclines and the inside is exposed . I really hope not though as that is one expense i would like to avoid . I have been thinking that i might go for a simple front room with a Japanese style , no furniture just wood ! that would sort the little buggers out ! Fight ON ! <p> We have a long lasting problem . In our former flat we started to get moth holes in our most beloved cloth ( of course ) . We thought these were due to moth as the holes were the clear moth holes . We have asked someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with standard moth products . The specialist neither us have never found proof of moth in the flat . We have washed all our clothes , put them in plastic bags . It kept eating our clothes . We have now moved into a new house . And guess what we are having same problems again . We are having a very clean house , we are putting moth repellents . We have no proof of having moths , no eggs , no food , no dead moth . But we kept having new holes in our clothes , holes which can not be made by something else than an insect . Either this is a ghost moth or this is another insect . Does anyone has a hand for us as we are hopeless ? thanks a lot . Dom <p> Thank for the information . I 've just recently discovered these in my bedroom . I found a larvae on my wall initially I thought it was just a piece of fluff , but then I noticed it was moving ! I killed it and did n't  think much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page very informative as I was completely unaware of what a problem these critters could be . When I inspected my room more thoroughly I found several more larvae and two living moths . I 've hoovered the room thoroughly , but as I did this after the first was found , I think I might have to try some of the more agressive measures suggested . Wish me luck ! <p> hi my name is sheila i am getting worring about my dog becase he has lost his coat what can i do to help him can you give me somethink what to do for please can i buy somethink to help his coat please i would be very happy if you can help me ok i would be help you can help what what can you buy for my dog then ok can you help me ok please sheila milne <p> I find clove oil to help . I spray it often on the rug and floors sometimes with other oils to clean the wood floors . I still have a problem , I need to seal the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love my Persian rug , synthetic is n't the same , so its war against the moth . <p> Moved into a flat with my wife at the start of March . Saw a moth or two , killed it like any person who has never heard of nor encountered these types would . <p> Incidentally the Daily Mail ran their usual start-of-the-year scare story on the same day I 'd seen the moths , indicating it was prime time for clothes-munching critters . Oh hell . I knew instantly it was going to be this . <p> I left it initially to see how it would play out , partially because I did n't  want to tell the wife who is terrified of months ( just to add extra fun to the whole scenario ) . We initially had around 8-10 total in the first 6 weeks . In fact , right up until yesterday , we only had about 12 or so . For some reason , yesterday , we found 5-6 alone . <p> It seems like I 'm potentially in the beginning stages compared to some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick wool carpets EVERYWHERE except the bathroom and kitchen . <p> Today , I bought 2 Rentokil Clothes Moth powders , hanger casettes , and spray . I 'm going to hoover , powder , hoover , spray and then repeat in a few days . <p> Fingers crossed . Let 's hope this is the end and not the beginning . ( I 've informed the landlord ! ! ) . <p> Found this one post indicating that all life stages ( including eggs ! ) can not survive temperatures above 99 F for 7 days . Once the temperature gets close to 99 F outside , I 'm cranking the heat to 105 F for 10 days ! I am so hoping this will work . See this link for this info on temperatures . <p> I also found a store that sells Trichogramma wasps a microscopic ( about the size of the dot in the letter i ) natural parasitic wasp that seeks out moth eggs to lay its own eggs inside , thereby rendering them their own , instead of the moth ! ! Will try this while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace only goes up to 32 C / 89.6 F. I am now searching for pest control companies that will heat the entire home into the mid 50-s centigrade for several hours , like Ann mentioned in her post on Nov30/2014 <p> " Put a Google search in for heat pest control for moths ' and you will see a number of companies that will heat your whole house ( after removing wax candles etc. ) to the mid 50-s centigrade for several hours and that apparently gets rid of everything living , including moths in all stages from eggs to adults " <p> I desperately hope to find a company in Mississauga , Ontario to heat the house in this way . These moths are ruining my life . <p> We lived in England for five years and , being a sewer , I brought home masses of English wool . Have lost so much of it to mothsvery sad . So we started using moth traps . They seem expensive , $4.00 each , but that is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odd moth , but weve also hung up old fashioned icky , sticky fly paper which takes care of those guys . <p> After our powder and spray blitz , the landlord sent in a carpet cleaner around 10 days later . We went the entire of May without seeing any . Saw around 3 in the past few days but also had our balcony open for the first time since we moved in , and we have seen these critters around outside we even saw one in the hall 1 floor below us .. ! ! <p> I do wonder if they 've survived our nuclear attack or these couple came in from outside , but I 'm going to put down another bottle of spray tomorrow . <p> My wife and I have a clothes/carpet moth infestation in five rooms of an eight-room house . We have had two pest control companies in to survey and quote for the work . Neither of these will offer a guarantee . One of them quoted 2400 UK pounds to treat all of our furniture in a heat pod . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent re-infestation after treatment , so I think this is a complete rip-off . Having spent the past month speaking to various UK suppliers and manufacturers of anti-moth products and doing internet research , I have come up with the following : <p> 1 . Most spray products for home use contain cypermethrin at a concentration of typically 0.1 % w/w . This does not kill eggs or larvae , only adults . It does , however , have a residual effect lasting around four weeks , so if any adults hatch out in that time period they will be killed . <p> 2 . Insecticidal powders typically contain 0.5% w/w permethrin . I have not been able to find out for sure how long the residual effect of these powders lasts for , but it will kill adult moths and larvae , but not eggs . <p> 3 . Smoke bombs or fumers contain around 13.5% w/w permethrin . They will permeate into all parts of a room and will only knock down adult moths . Leave cupboard and wardrobe doors and drawers open when using them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the droplets are bigger than smoke particles and drop out of the air quickly . <p> 4 . The consensus appears to be that cedar and lavender-based products may have some deterrent value in sealed spaces such as drawers , but need very regular replenishment . They are of no use if eggs or larvae are already present . <p> 5 . Several UK companies supply products containing transfluthrin . As far as I can ascertain , this is the only product that will kill all life stages of clothes moths ( eggs , larvae and adults ) . It is available as hanging cassettes , sachets for drawers and cupboards and sprays , all of which are lavender-scented . Concentration in the carpet and fabric sprays is 0.1% transfluthrin w/w . The spray apparently has a low residual effect , but I have not yet been able to discover how long it lasts .

@@119850937 @8850937/ <p> If you are installing a new thicker carpet , thicker underlay , or wood flooring you may find that your doors need trimming for the flooring to fit underneath . <p> There are several ways to do this : <p> Remove the door from its hinges and cut it using a hand saw or circular saw . <p> Cut it in place using a hand saw or circular saw . <p> Use a special purpose door trimming saw . <p> I decided to trim mine using a door trimming saw . These are expensive to buy , and you are n't going to use them much , so it can be a lot cheaper to hire them . I hired one for the day from HSS hire . Here is a link to the door trimming saw I hired for -36.84 ( the prices on their website do n't include VAT ) . <p> I had to order it a week in advance as they said it was a very popular item and fully booked . <p> Here is what the saw looks like . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to be slid along a flat floor , and the 4 screws at the corners near the bottom allow the height of the blade to be modified . <p> The blade comes out of the front when you push the spring loaded handle forward . The amount the blade comes out is only just enough to cut a standard door , so you will have to keep it fully pushed forward to make the cut . <p> Each of the 4 height screws has measurements on it so it is easy to set the saw to the correct level . <p> There is a vacuum port to suck the sawdust away , but I found that my Dyson hose was the wrong size to connect to it . I got around this by using masking tape to connect the hose to the door trimmer . <p> To help prevent the bottom of the door from splintering I wrapped masking tape around it . <p> Then I started using the saw . First turning on the vacuum , then the saw . When it is at full speed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you cut in the correct direction . In the case of the saw I was using the cut had to be made left to right . <p> The saw is very noisy and even with the vacuum sucking away most of the sawdust there was still enough dust in the air to set off the room 's smoke alarm ! Because the blade is enclosed and hidden away from your face it should be fairly safe to use , but you should still wear safety glasses in case you get a rogue flying splinter . <p> It took about 3 minutes to cut each door by sliding the saw slowly from left to right . I found that it wo n't get close enough to the door frame to cut the very edge , so I had to do the final 1cm with a hand saw . I could then finish off by giving the edges a quick sand , and then repainting any bits where the paint had flaked off . <p> Even with the vacuum running there was still loads of sawdust on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three doors that I did . <p> It is still hard work to push the blade through the doors , but much easier and more accurate than using a hand saw . 
@@119850938 @8850938/ <p> Like many people who have to use a computer all day , every day , as part of their job , I find that I regularly get a painful or numb feeling in my wrists and arms . <p> This is my story of what I 've done to try to make that numbness and pain go away . I 'll add a usual disclaimer , pointing out that I 'm not a medical expert , this is just personal account , and that you should get advice from a professional if you have any kind of pain . <p> Office work is dangerous <p> It all started when I began my first job in an office . People may think that working in an office is safe for your health . My experience is that it is not ! <p> Over the first weeks and months that I was there I started getting a feeling of numbness in my wrists when I was sat at my desk using the keyboard and mouse . I also started getting knee pain , which is something I have previously written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on a while I decided to request a DSE ( display screen equipment ) assessment . Fortunately this easy to do at my company . Within a week I was visited by someone from a DSE company who looked at how I was sitting , and how I was using the keyboard , mouse , and monitor . <p> He made adjustments to a few aspects of the way I sat at my desk , including raising the height of my monitor , and making a few adjustments to my chair . <p> He raised my chair to make sure that I did n't have to tilt my arms up to use the mouse and keyboard . Because of my raised chair , I had to get a foot rest as well to keep my legs comfortable . <p> He also gave basic advice such as telling me to take regular breaks from the computer . <p> To help me remember to take regular breaks I installed the free SCIROCCO Take a Break software which I configured to pop up a reminder every half an hour . <p> Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in my wrists and arms every day I worked at the office , but I learnt to live with it . The severity of the problem was n't improving , but it was n't getting any worse either . <p> I 'd found that the problem was always much worse if I worked with bare arms . If I had the sleeves of a jumper covering my arms the pain or numbness would n't be as severe or as noticeable . <p> One theory I have for this is that when wearing a jumper , the extra fabric around my arms acts like a cushion , preventing me from constricting any of the nerves in my arm as severely as when they rest on my desk . This is just my personal theory , and I ca n't give any scientific proof that it would work for anyone else . <p> You do n't always want to wear a jumper when it is hot so I discovered that I got the same improvement if I just wore fabric wristbands . You 'll find these in clothes shops that sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercisers <p> During this time I tried a number of other things to try to reduce the pain . I gave wrist braces a go , but I found them to be very restrictive for my wrist and arm movements . I much preferred using simple fabric wristbands as I spoke about above . <p> I tried using a number of different pills . I tried multi-vitamin tablets , cod liver oil , and glucosamine sulphate . It is possible that they helped with my general health , or even helped with my specific wrist problems , but to be honest I did n't notice any difference when I was using them . <p> I also tried using wrist exercisers , but I did n't find they improved anything . If anything I found that my wrists felt worse after using these . <p> Electric conduction tests <p> After many years of putting up with my wrist problems I decided that I really should see my doctor . When I went to see him he asked me some questions , took a look at my arm , and then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical conduction tests done on my right arm ( the right was worse than the left ) . He said that I might have a mild form of carpel tunnel syndrome . <p> At the hospital they attached an electrode to one finger at a time , put some salt gel on my arm , and then measured how easily electricity conducted through the nerves . They also did tests that caused my fingers and arm to twitch as a result of the electricity . <p> I got the results a week later which said that my nerves were fine , and if anything was wrong with them it was very mild . <p> The physiotherapist started by asking about my problem , and then doing basic manipulations on my arms to judge what the problem was . She though the problem was caused by tightness in my muscles , not just around my arm and wrist , but also in my shoulders , neck , and back . <p> She explained how the nerves are connected , and how problems in your back can also affect your arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massage on my arm to loosen up the tissue structures . This was quite painful , and would leave me with red and purple bruises . <p> She also did massage on my shoulder and back areas to loosen any tissue structures that might be constricting the nerves which lead to my hands . <p> As well as the deep tissue massage she showed me a variety of stretches . These were n't just hand stretches , there were stretches for my back , arm and neck as well . She was trying to work on the whole length of where the problem might be coming from . <p> Another DSE visit <p> The physio wanted to see how I used my computer equipment . As my employer would n't pay for an onsite visit ( it was n't covered by the insurance ) , they arranged for the DSE assessor to visit again . <p> He once again looked at how my desk was set up . He made an additional recommendation . He said that I should change from using a full size keyboard to a mini-keyboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do from the mouse to the keyboard might be causing problems . <p> The extra travel distance is caused by the numeric keypad of a full sized keyboard . I 've highlighted in red the amount of travel when you use a full sized and mini keyboard in the photo below . <p> He took photos of me using my equipment which I was able to send to the physio . <p> Back at the physio <p> The physio was able to use the photos to make another suggestion . She thought that my mouse was causing me to twist my arm in an unnatural way . She recommended an ergonomic mouse . <p> She had a number of different ones which I was able to borrow , and after experimenting I settled on a vertical grip mouse like the one in the photo below . I bought it from Helashop ( who do n't  seem to exist anymore ) , but there are loads of other ergonomic mice available from Amazon as well . I 'd advise you to try them before you buy , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next photo you can see the difference one of these mice makes in the position and angle of my arm , as opposed to using a standard mouse . <p> Two mice are better than one <p> I made a further change in my desk . I started using a second mouse . For the left hand I used a standard mouse , and I used the ergonomic mouse for my right hand . It does take a while to get used to using a mouse with your other arm , but you can do it if you practice for a few weeks . <p> By using two mice rather than one you can spread the load more evenly over both arms , rather than having your dominant arm take most of the damage . <p> After 8 years , what worked , what did n't <p> I 've had knee and arm numbness for 8 years now , at varying degrees of severity . First of all these are the things that I found did n't help me . <p> Wrist braces " I found these too tight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you use a computer all day then make sure it is set up correctly . Any slight problems in the way you use them build up over time . Ask your employer if they can arrange for an assessment . <p> Physio " Physio was very helpful , both to help me understand the causes of the problem , and to help with the treatment . It was definitely worth treating the back and shoulders as well as the specific wrist area . <p> Stretching " I found the wrist , shoulder , neck , and back stretches reduced the severity of the problem . If you ca n't motivate yourself to stretch regularly ; a yoga , pilates , or dance class may help you . <p> Wearing a jumper or wrist band " This is n't a recommendation you often hear , but I find that keeping my wrist covered by fabric helped a lot . <p> Ergonomic mouse " I did find my right arm was more comfortable when using the ergonomic mouse . <p> Using two mice , left and right " Two is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two arms . <p> A mini keyboard " The reduced amount of travel of my arm between the mouse and mini keyboard help as well . <p> Computer timer " I recommend you have a timer on your computer to remind you to take regular breaks . It is very easy to lose track of time , and end up spending hours using the computer without a break . 213587 @qwx1073587 <h> 5 Responses to " Wrist and arm pain when using a computer " <p> Unfortunately the Law is so vaguely drafted as regards screen breaks , any employer can drive a coach and horse through it . Basically the employer can claim that leaving the computer for 1 or 2 minutes per hour means staff are getting screen breaks . There is no definition as to the length of a break so 1 second can be a break or blinking and eye can be a break as there is no minimum length . My employer claims going to the printer occasionally fulfils the legal obligations . The DSE staff , pressurise the staff into giving the right answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets an impossible availability target of 85% for the day which includes tea breaks . They comply with the bare minimum of the law , free eye tests etc but exploit the weakness of the law to the max , cutting themselves a massive amount of slack . Another problem is in the shape of computer desks . In order to cram as many desks in as possible and through sheer bad design , desks are frequently too narrow ie there is not enough depth in the desk , so the operator can rest their wrists on the table and sit at a comfortable distance from the screen . Minimum sizes of fonts need to be regulated , as I often encounter software with microscopic font sizes . Another problem is lack of fresh air in large open plan offices , with no access to windows . Staff are cooped up like battery hens . Lack of fresh air and exercise , hot humid environments etc lead to poor performance which managers counteract by micromanaging , high targets , pressure and constant monitoring . This is all in the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My best advice is to learn to use the mouse with both hands and switch over frequently it only takes a few days . Nevertheless I still developed tendonitis in both forearms / wrists and once the tendons are sensitised , it is very hard to get rid off . <p> I have also suffered since uni with back pain and a numbing arm with shooting pain . When I went to my GP she told me to stop sitting at my desk ! Helpful So I went to an osteopath privately . It was much better after seeing the osteopath a few times , and since becoming more aware of my posture and desk setup etc I have been better long term . There really needs to be more awareness about preventing these symptoms to start with ! I feel now I 'm just staving off later-life pain ( I 'm 25 ) . I was blissfully unaware as a student . <p> Im surprised by a small keyboard tip , purely because I feel I hunch up more when I 'm typing on a small keyboard . Good tips though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just felt like it was making my arm more numb . <p> Its worth noting that the timer prompting a break is also useful for reducing impact on your vision ! <p> the top on my left hand was swallon and hurt now my whole arm is hurting I can not raise my arm to comb my hair . I work on a computer that is sitting on a banquet table all day , do you think this have something to do with it . <p> Hi Donna , if the pain gets worse when you use the computer that could be the cause . You really should see a doctor ! <p> A banquet table does n't  sound very ergonomic ! If it is too high for the keyboard/mouse maybe you should try to position the keyboard/mouse at a lower level . I sit my keyboard/mouse on a plank of material which I put on my lap . 
@@119850940 @8850940/ <p> If you 've ever wondered what a million pounds ( -1,000,000 ) looks like this post may help . Unfortunately I do n't have a million pounds , but I do have one single twenty pound note . Here it is : <p> I also have a ruler , a calculator , and a copy of Paint Shop Pro . I 'm therefore going to create a million pounds out of -20 notes . To do this I need to know the dimensions of the -20 bank note . Each one is 149x80mm with a thickness of 0.113mm . A stack of 100 notes with a value of -2000 will therefore be just 11.3mm high . Or 1.13cm if you prefer . <p> Here is -2000 with some mystery legs to give you a sense of scale . <p> Of course your -2000 stack will only look like this if you use fresh new banknotes straight off the printing press . If you build the stack out of used banknotes it wo n't look so neat because of all the crinkles and folds . <p> What does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred thousand pounds ( -100,000 ) look like ? A bit like this photo , 9 stacks , each with a bit over eleven thousand pounds in it . A nice block of money I 'm sure you 'll agree . <p> What does one million pounds look like ? <p> So what does a million pounds look like ? I 've built my million pounds out of 25 blocks of -40,000 . Each of these blocks is 22.6cm high . So my million is about 45.2cm high with a single block of -40,000 at the front . One million is made of 50,000 -20 notes . <p> What if instead of being in a big block , all the notes were in a single pile ? If that were done we 'd have a stack of notes 5.65m high . To put that in perspective I put the stack next to a London double-decker bus . You can see that one million is a bit higher than a bus . <p> There are a few more all important questions to answer . <p> Would one million pounds fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film or crime drama where the villain brings a brief case full of bank notes to a meeting how much would fit in there ? If it is filled with -20 notes then we could fit about -100,000 in a brief case . <p> If we are dealing with -50 notes then we could fit about -250,000 in a slightly bigger brief case . <p> As for bringing a million pounds in a brief case " it is n't going to work . <p> Would one million pounds fit in a suit case ? <p> With a suitcase you can transport much more serious money . You can definitely fit a million in a suitcase using -20 notes . And using -50 notes you can easily lug two million pounds around . <p> What would one million pounds weigh ? <p> One million pounds using -20 notes would weigh about 50kg ! You 'd have to be pretty strong to be able to carry it . If you put it in a suitcase and tried to check it on to an aircraft you 'd be racking up some serious excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to pay for it ! <p> Using -50 notes your million would weigh about 22kg . This would almost fit into your usual 20kg airline allowance . And if you put some of the notes in your hand luggage you 'd completely escape any excess baggage charge . <p> If we go back to the suitcase example -100,000 of -20 bank notes in a briefcase would weigh about 5kg . If you add in the weight of the briefcase you still have a fairly portable brief case of cash . <p> This is fantastic ! I wonder if you really printed all money and cut them did you printed back of the note too ? Where are they now ? Have you ever try to use it ? What kind of paper did you used ? How did you know the thickness of the -20 note is 0.113mm , such a delicate number . Sorry I got little excited , too many questions . Anyway congratulation for your work . I am very impressed . <p> Hi Matsuko . I did n't  use any paper to do this it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just digitally made a small bundle of notes , and then duplicated it many times to produce the large stacks of money : ) <p> I found the exact dimension for the bank notes from the Bank of England website . <p> Haha !

@@119850943 @8850943/ <p> About 5 years ago I started developing a lump on my leg on my thigh . It grew to the size of a small marble .

A year ago I spotted that it had grown larger . It had now reached the size of a large marble under my skin . I went back to the doctor and this time we decided to get it removed .

This waiting area was full of other people in surgical robes either waiting for their surgery to begin , or sitting there under observation after their surgery was complete . <p> More waiting was involved , until the surgeon appeared and lead me to another room . This room was like a doctors room . It had a movable bed ( plastic , not fabric covered ) , and lots of cupboards . Another nurse was in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some questions and took a look at my lump . She explained what she was going to do .

She shaved the area and then using a marker pen drew a few lines onto the lump where she was going to cut . She then swabbed some liquid ( I 'm guessing it was iodine ) onto the area to sterilise it . <p> Next was the anaesthetic .

More injections followed until finally she was satisfied that the area of my leg would not feel anything . <p> As I was lying down I fortunately could n't see exactly what she was doing . I saw her holding a scalpel blade . I do n't  know exactly when she started cutting into my leg .

If she could n't get it out intact then there was a risk that a piece could get left behind which would start growing again . <p> She also told me that it was quite firmly attached at the bottom so it would require a lot of cutting to remove . She continued cutting and snipping for another 15 minutes . I did n't  feel any of it . All I could feel from my leg was a numb feeling caused by the anaesthetic . Similar to the numb feeling you might get from a dentist anaesthetic . <p> Finally she announced that it had been removed ! <p> She checked that there were no pieces left and then got ready to sew me back up . Doing the stitches ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be straightforward . She used 6 stitches in the area . She told me that they usually have the ends cut short but in my case shed leave them long so they did n't  come undone . There was a risk as the incision was in a mobile part of my leg . <p> On top of the main stitches she stuck some paper stitches down so the main stitches would n't move about . I had a look at the wound at this point and the sight was not great . It was as if someone had cut a one inch hole into my leg and then sewn it back up which of course is what had happened . <p> She then put a giant plaster over the stitches and finally wrapped a bandage tightly round my leg . <p> She told me that I should take it easy today , and warned that my leg could be very painful once the anaesthetic wore off . I could take some standard pain killers if I needed them . I was to take it easy for the next few weeks but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No running , sports or anything stressful for my leg , but normal walking would be fine . In two weeks I should go to a nurse at my doctors practice to get the stitches removed . I was also told not to get the wound wet . I could shower if I kept my leg away from the water , but definitely no baths . <p> It all sounded like it had gone very smoothly . Little did I know that the surgery was only the start ! <p> Before I left the operating room she showed me the cyst in a bottle . It was white , quite spherical and the size of a large marble . It looked a bit like an eyeball ! <p> Afternoon recovery <p> After the surgery I was told to sit down in the waiting area and have a drink and a biscuit . 10 minutes later I was allowed to leave . <p> It was quickly apparent that walking with an anaesthetised , stitched up leg was to be a slow affair . I made it to be bus and managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leg up and tried to rest it as much as I could manage . For several hours the area of my leg that had been operated on remained very numb . Slowly the numbness started wearing off , to be replaced with a sharp painful stinging sensation . <p> I 'd been told that I could take painkillers if I needed them . The problem is that you do n't  know how much the pain is going to increase by . I decided not to take any pain killers unless the pain got really bad . <p> For another few hours the anaesthetic wore off . The pain did increase but it was manageable . It was most noticeable when trying to move or walk . <p> I had to sleep on my back that night as my leg was too painful ( and too fragile given that it had new stitches in it ) for me to put any pressure on that leg . <p> The next day <p> The next morning the pain had died down considerably . I was able to hobble around , but my limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible as I knew that I needed to give my wound a chance to heal . <p> Recovering <p> Over the next two weeks the pain reduced more . I was able to take the bandage off in the first week but the large plaster remained covering my wound . I had no idea what was happening underneath , but I was hoping that the hole was closing up . <p> It was no longer painful when sitting or walking , but the pain was there if any pressure was applied to the area . I still couldnt sleep on my side . <p> As the days wore on I could walk more and more normally . I thought it must be getting better . <p> Visit to to the nurse <p> Two weeks after my surgery I visited the nurse to have the stitches removed . I could n't visit the nurse at my doctors practice as they were dealing with a mice infestation , so I went to the Soho Walk-In Centre . You do n't  need an appointment to go here , but you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived after work and after filling in the form they gave me , I had to wait nearly two hours before I was seen . <p> The nurse was very friendly and after questioning me asked me to sit on the bed . First she removed the giant plaster and then started removing the paper stitches . I was watching as she did this . <p> The paper stitches are stuck onto the skin ( like match stick wide pieces of masking tape ) . The adhesion is fairly strong so a bit of pull is needed to remove them . As she took them off it became very obvious that my wound was still completely open . Only the main stitches were holding each side of my skin together . <p> She spotted that one of the longs ends of one of the stitches was sticking inside my leg . Perhaps this was making it harder for the wound to heal . She re-positioned the end part of the stitch and told me that it was clearly too early for the stitches to be taken out . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another giant plaster over the wound . She told me to come back in a week . <p> Before I left I did find out that in order to avoid a two hour wait it would be a good idea to get there just before 8am when it opened . <p> A week later <p> A week later I went back to the Soho Walk-In Centre . As suggested I got there before 8am . There were already a few people waiting . At 8am the door was opened and we were let in . I filled in the form and after about 10 minutes was collected by another nurse . <p> She removed the giant plaster , and then the paper stitches . The wound looked pretty similar to a week ago . It still was n't closing up . <p> The nurse told me that she would have to remove the stitches anyway . She said that there was a limit to how long they could be left in . She removed the stitches which is very quick and painless by the way and then cleaned up the wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the two edges of skin together and then put another giant plaster over the top . She gave me some giant plasters so I could replace the plaster a few times and told me to come back a week later . <p> The next two weeks <p> Over the next two weeks I visited the Soho Walk-In Centre three more times . Each time my wound would be examined , cleaned and be re-dressed . Each time when I saw the wound again it did n't  appear to be much better . Each time I was told to come back in 3-5 days . <p> One one occasion to save me a visit one of the nurses gave me a dressing kit so that I could re-dress the wound myself the next time . And I was given a supply of the Mepore giant plasters so I could change them every few days . <p> On another of the visits a gel was squeezed into the wound which was supposed to encourage the healing process . <p> A breakthrough <p> It was now four weeks since my surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if the wound could be infected . In fact one of the nurses had wondered this but after getting a second opinion had decided it was n't . <p> On visit number 6 to the Walk-In Centre the nurse I saw told me she believed the wound was infected . She explained that this was why it was n't healing up . She cleaned and re-dressed the wound . Over the actual wound she put an inadine sheet . This is a small piece of fabric which is soaked in iodine . Iodine helps to kill bacteria . She also gave me a prescription for Flucloxacillin an anti-biotic which is similar to penicillin . I was to take this three times a day for the next week . <p> The Flucloxacillin caused me no problems apart from one day when I had a lot of chest tightness . On my 7th visit to the nurse I mentioned this side-effect but was just told to keep taking it . <p> On my 8th visit I saw real improvement to the wound . It looked like the anti-biotic had killed the infection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed up . Rather than putting a giant plaster over the wound the nurse put a thin see-though skin-like layer over the top of it . She said this would help the scab that was over the wound to break down and would speed up the healing process . <p> The end <p> Six weeks after my surgery I made my 9th visit to the Soho Walk-In Centre . My wound was now fully closed up . The nurse took off the skin-like layer , cleaned the wound and put another one of the skin-like layers over the top . She told me to leave this layer on for another week . She told me that there should be no need to come back ! <p> Indeed this was my last visit to the nurse , after taking the final skin-like layer off I was able to leave the wound exposed . It still had a large scar over the area , and there was a indent where the cyst had been but at least I could have normal baths , and showers again . <p> Over the next 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared and the indentation is still there but it is good to have got rid of the lump even though the whole experience was a lot more hassle than it should have been . <p> Nice post ! I am getting a cyst removed this monday on my left shoulder . I 've had it drained 3 xs and it came back again . I showed the surgeon that drained it last time and he said that it needed to get cut out . This time it is n't infected or very large so hopefully it wont be painful when it is removed . Thanks ! <p> Hmm , well I had mine removed 3 weeks ago . It was about the size of a kidney and directly in the middle of my back , just where my bra strap crosses horisontally . I 've started the self medicate on antibiotics which I got for a rout canal , as I am quite worried about the wound . Stitches are supposed to disolve now , but there is no evidence that it is happening . Also I do n't  think the wound is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took them 1 hr and 15 min. to cut it out of my back , directly on my spine . I also keep having this pain to the left of the wound and it feels like the whole area now contains a smaller lipoma that could fall out if I move to much . The area underneath and around the stitches does not seem to heal well from the inside out . God help me , I just pray it heals quickly . <p> For you folks still waiting a similar procedure , I 'd suggest take time out from work and plan a month long holiday to watch television and read at home ! <p> I have a lipoma on the right side of my waist , its about the size of a cricket ball . <p> I found the lump eight years ago when it was diagnosed as a lipoma by my GP . <p> 8 weeks ago the GP looked again and said it was fine , although huge in size . Two weeks after another GP sent me to a cancer specialist as a precaution , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be benign . I am now awaiting removal by surgery.mainly due to the size and location , its very noticable and irritating if wrong waistband worn .. so awaiting surgerywill update after . <p> I was diagnosed with a Lipoma a few weeks back , which is located over the back of my shoulder which has been growing at a slow pace for the last 3 years but over the last year has been quite painfulorignally i had believed it was a muscle tear from injury , but decided at the beginning of the year to investigate due to the pain and size , as it about the size of a tennis ball . <p> It was only confirmed after having an MRI Scan.so will be attending back at the hospital next week to book in for a surgey appointment.due to size and pain that it causes .. <p> I just had one taken out of my thigh in Spain . The stitches came out in 2 steps . 10 days and 14 days . It looked the same as yours . I healed fatser . I am flad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I recommend taking them out if you have insurance or can afford it . My doctor had much difficulty removing it , I just hope he got it all , as if it comes back , I cant go through this all again . <p> I had one removed from my thigh a few years ago . I have a number of them on both thighs , but this one was so large that it showed through my pants leg . The doctor showed it to me after it was out and it was almost the size of a golf ball . But the wound was quite deep . The sides did not meet and as it healed , it left a deep " crevice " in my thigh . It is quite noticeable and I ran out of creative explanations for it " That 's where the bear clawed me . " " Got that in a bar fight . " But at least it does n't  show through my pants leg . <p> I had a lipoma removed Sept 4 2009 . I had it done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in BC Canada . The lipoma took 10 years to grow from aprox 2 cc to around a small hand fullmaybe 5oz by volume directly over my right S.I . joint on my lower back . It was at the site of chronic pain which they ( Doctors ) say is a coincidence . Other practioners ( chiro , massage ) said having a big lump like that right over the joint could possibly interfere with free movement and lead to pain . I think it makes a difference having it gone . I am healing quite well but would have liked more post op info . I paid $900 for removal by a cosmetic surgeon . He explained the procedure very throughlydid extra work with three layers of stitches to ensure no crevice . <p> I had 2 large lipoma removed from my forearm today in London at the Ealing Hospital ( no cost as it was done on the NHS ) . My external stitches were proper stitches unlike your paper stitches plus I was told to remove the bandage on day 2 and allow the wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an antibiotic cream to apply each day to stop the wound drying out ) . <p> I am a chicken when it comes to pain but the initial injections were ok . <p> Had this lump on the back of my neck for decades . Started out as a minor mass then recently had grown to the size of a small golf ball . At first I thought it was a limpoma so I tried reducing it with green clay applications combined with Tea Tree oil . That did not do much . I decided finally to seek out a surgical solution . The Syrian doctor that operated was very good . The hardest part was the anesthetic injections . They felt like bee stings . Turns out it was a cyst . As I write this message I am about 50 hours post surgery and have started removing the bandage in the daytime to air out the incision . 4 stitches inside to avoid crevasing and six outside . Very nicely done . Should have done it long ago . <p> I have multipal lipomas . Several on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although they are unsightly , they do not cause pain . Wondering if you can remove several at one time ? Does lipo work or must they be cut out for best results ? <p> I have a very large lipoma on my left leg and I am going in tomorrow to have removed . After reading your story and I am really scared now and I hope all goes well tomorrow . I have put it off for over 15 years and it has grown bigger and bigger and bigger . <p> i have the same bump on my wrist . my doctor says its a cyst and that i should get it removed cause it hurts . i 'm going to call the hand surgeon to set up something . but there is a problem ! my cyst is partly under a vein and right next to another one . ive never had surgery before and am kinda scared ! <p> Under a vein ? wow . i actually work in surgery and have removed many cysts and lipomas . The tricky thing with cysts is that you cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " capsule " , which is thin fibrous tissue that forms the outer wal of the cyst. in a way , a bit easier that a lipoma removal because you do n't  always know if you are moving enough fat ( which is what a lipoma is ) . <p> it is interesting that your cyst is under a vein . if you are dealing with a hand surgeon , you are in good hands . I only have experience in general surgery , and their training is much more extensive . infact , in teaching hospitals that I am familar with , its the first year residents who get " stuck " having to do minor procedures like removing cysts and lipoma. they are both minor procedures and not much to worry about Jean . <p> if the incision site looks very redish and not closing when you go for a followup , you should be getting antibiotics , in my opinion . <p> I do have quite afew bumps all over my body now but most of the bigger ones are on my thighs the biggest almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count up of the bumps 4-5 years ago an it was aroun 18-22 , I 'm beginning to notice more growing around my belly and my back . I think I might have to look into getting them removed <p> I found a lump in my chest thought omg when the doctor called it a lipoma ( i got it confused with lymphoma ! ) Worse bit was the MRI and the surgeon telling me this could really hurt for 6 weeks . It was a different surgeon on the day medical staff and nurses were superb and we joked all the way i was determined to be brave and happy ! . The aneasethist was a joke too a nurse put my drip in after the aneasethist had made 3 poor attempts . Woke up after to be greeted by the most gorgeous blond nurse ever had no drama , healed up real quick scar is a mere pink line now , about 2 years after . I felt absolutely nothing even after the Op . Left a 3 inch scar i 'm proud of So do n't  get stressed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly harmless . However you should still see your doctor to get it checked out . Particularly as you say that one is growing . Always see your doctor about any growing or new lumps . <p> That is a pretty nasty scar , maybe it was done by the same person who disfigured our Boxer who had a benign tumor on its head . Poor dog ended up with a massive Frankensteins monster scar on the top of its head . From showdog to mutt in about 15 minutes <p> Hello Im Kaden And I 'm 19 Years Old I Have 7 of these all in different places the biggest is on my abdomen the size of a large marble . i 'm embarassed to even take my shirt off at the beach .. how much would it cost to get them removed ? ? ? <p> I have lot of lypomos in my body ( around 30 ) . On my shoulder one big lypoma is there and its not painful . 3 yrs back , I Contacted a doctor . He suggested me to do n't  remove it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lypoma . Because there may be damage to small nurves , when they do surgery . <p> Now the lypoma size is increasing day by day . I want to remove this . <p> Pls suggest me , which specialized doctor I need to contact and what are the good hospital in hyderabad . <p> I have had several lipoma cysts removed in my arms and have many more popping up that need removed because they are big and painful . I have had no problems with the surgery to remove them . I was put to sleep for both surgeries . They did not leave me awake for any of it . I would have wished to be awake but had no trouble any way . Go for it ! If it hurts , and is big and disruptive get it removed with no fear ! <p> I am due for surgery on a lipoma close to and along side my left shoulder blade . It is about the size of an egg and was found by a physiotherapist . It moves up and down and side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dragging feelind and the area it covers feels sort of numb . Three months ago I had surgery to my left shoulder to re attach muscles and file some bone away between the shoulder joint . I have recovered well from this and am nearing the end of physio but I am concerned that the limpoma might be attached to nerves or muscles which might be damage during its removal . Also how long it will be before I 'm able to drive . My doctor stressed that the removal was going to hurt a lot and that I would be left with a large scar . None of this bothers me but not being able to drive does ! <p> as my observation regarding this story .. when you have a small or a big surgery .. automatically as far as im concern , you need to drink an antibiotic , to fast healing the wound together with the pain reliever , you do n't  have to wait to feel the pain and weeks and months to drink antibioticantibiotic is a big help to any infections and viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him a large bump that has been growing on my thigh . He says it is possibly a cyst or a lipoma . It is now the size of a half dollar and is interfering with my activities . When I push on it is feels hard and not really movable . It also hits a nerve which makes my leg go numb . When I see a surgeon for this do I ask for a biopsy of the lump ? I have never had anything like this before and am scared because I also developed Lupus 4 years ago . Maybe this is a effect of lupus . <p> Hi Stacey , Cysts and lipomas are usually fairly easy to remove if they are just under the skin , so it probably is n't anything to worry about . Mine was on my thigh too , and they did the surgery with local anaesthetic . It is worth asking the surgeon if a biopsy is necessary . In my case they tested the lump after they had removed it , but it was nothing harmful . Good luck ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its under my knee . I 'm so scared to do it the surgery , I do n't  wan na have a big scarf on my leg : ( but i know that i should do it the surgery because it will groow bigger and bigger . It ; s really hard decission for me : ( <p> I have had a lipoma since I was 12 , I am 27 now . I have been checking it with the doctors regularly , all of them said to leave it . Now it grew a lot , It is very sore and inflamed . My GP told me that it is a sebaceous cyst and it is to be removed like a spot ? ? ? ? . I am very scared , I do n't  know why he is not referring me to the surgeon ! What should I do ? <p> Hi Anna , you should really talk to your GP about this . Or if you cant get good answers from him you should see another GP . Some GPs will do minor surgery themselves so maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get another GP at the same practice to remove my lipoma ( which was actually a cyst ) but when the other GP looked at it he thought it was too large to be done at the doctors practice which is when I was referred to the hospital . Good luck ! <p> Thank you for your reply . I am really concerned why is it that everyone actually does n't  take it seriously ! ! Now I am taking Flucloxacillin for the inflamation/infection and am really tempted to go and do this privately . I live in UK and that is why my GP does n't  want to refer me to the surgeon , as this is cosmetic so does n't  apply for the NHS . This is the 6th day treatment of antibiotic and does n't  help . It is very sore and smells horrible . Although it is not opened I am embarassed when at work and keep spraying perfumesoh God . I hope you all guys will never have this again on your bodies ! <p> I was reading all of the above and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as a quarter close to the inside of my right thigh . I have a question , my doctor , about a year ago , thought it was nothing to worry about , so I havent had it checked out anymore , but was wondering if I may have a lipoma . It seems to be just under the skin and its quite firm . It is constantly on my mind day in and day out . Did anyones lipoma seem to swell all around ? When I wear stretchy pants it looks like a have a fat roll on my leg . Its really embarassing and I do n't  like the feeling when my 2 year old sits on my leg as it gives off a funny sensation . Also someone mentioned their leg was going numb . Well my leg is also . I 'm just very nervous and would like some opinions . Def. making another Drs appt .. <p> I discovered yesterday that I had a lump just under my hair line . At first this freaked me out because I suffer from migranes. lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at it ( she 's a nurse ) and said she thought it was a lipoma . So I 'm going to get it checked out . She also said that lipomas are usally caused by high cholesterol so if you have lots you may want to get that checked out to stop more forming . <p> I had an unsightly apricot sized lipoma and cyst removed from the nape of my neck on June 8th . The surgery was done at my local hospital in Spilimbergo ( N. Italy , Friuli ) . I had the stitches out yesterday and the incision has healed perfectly . I never experienced any pain or infection . So while its possible to experience complications as with any surgery my MD. and surgeon appear to have been correct when they informed me that in the vast majority of cases lipoma removal is quite straightforwardGood luck <p> Oh , forgot to mention that here in Italy lipoma removal is covered by national health . My co-pay for the pre-op visit , surgery , and removal of stitches ( 3 visits ) was 32 euros ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American ) . Also , lipomas are not caused by high cholesterol , mine , as a vegan is exceptionally low . In fact , there is no known reason for lipoma formation although they do tend to occur more frequently after a certain age , especially in women . When I went to my M.D. , somewhat freaked out by this odd growth he just laughed and said , " Mary , its a gift of old age " ( I 'm 60 ) Ciao tutti and do n't  fret about the surgeryThe 5 or 6 anesthetic shots are n't  all that painful either . My surgeon sprayed a numbing agent on my neck before the shots and I hardly felt a thingCiao tutti .. <p> hi , i have two lipomas on my leg . one is on the thigh and the other is on my right buttock. the problem is that they are pretty large around the size of cricket ball and the one on my buttock is even bigger . besides the fact that they are obvious if i wear tighter pants , the one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i had planned to get it removed a few days back but then postponed . Does it really get healed in more than a month ? And the indentation part is scaring me. since yes they are a bit deep . and i 'm 23 years old not overweight . i 'm so scared . you think i should just leave it ? What 's worse ? scarring and indentation or lumps : S : ( <p> Hi Emma . Your lipomas sound very big I would n't want to have lumps that large in my body , but obviously you have to decide what to do about it yourself . <p> It is now nearly two years since I had the surgery and I still have the indentation and small scar . But as it is on my upper thigh it does n't  bother me . It is n't visible to anyone in public . <p> It shouldnt have taken so long for mine to heal the problem in my case is that the wound got infected which is always a risk with any surgery . <p> Maybe you should talk to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worried about any indentations after the surgery . If is inevitable that if there is a lump in your body , once it is removed there will be a space where it used to be . I do n't  know whether it is possible to do anything about the indentation only the surgeon could give proper advice about this . Good luck ! <p> Get those lipomos taken out . larger they get the more they may start hurting muscles and nerves . I had two taken out 2 days ago . already moving my arm without alot of pain . one was getting about size of softball on my shoulder and alot of it was deep inside that is was pushing on my arm muscles and causing pain . Glad they are out . Surgery was easy , got pain pills and only had to take 3 of them since surgery , so do n't  get afraid . Have it done soon . Get an orthopedic surgeon if near muscles . Good luck to all . I get to shower tonight and removed bandages , but can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> hi i 'm rajiv and i m also suffering from multiple lipomas all over my body , they are in peanut size and some are smaller than that . ok fine , they are growing in numbers , i have around 40-50. so no one has mentioned their diet may be it happens due to some similer kind of diet . ok i tell u what i usually take , i used to smoke . i started at a very young age , may be when i was at the age of 15 , now i m 32. i drink alcohol . and also having a habit of over eating mostily i take vegg diet , som time in a month i take chicken or mutton , i take eggs but not on a regular basis . the only reson i found in many years is alcohol and smoke and the last reason may be overeating and not doing workout ( lazy lifestyle ) . <p> if the above reasons do n't  come under the causes of lipoma then it may be genetic if you find any similarities that plz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only can find out the reason beause we only suffering these little b******* . <p> Thanks for Sharing the experience , although I 'm going to have my Lipoma removed in 3days time , I 'm really scared , its located a little beneath my shoulders at the back measuring 7 by 7cm . I ll be brave and I believe all will be well . However , what bothers me more is my fiancees Dermoid cyst located in the middle of his chest . Its tiny and hard , Please I need you to let me know whether it wo n't get close to his heart during the surgery because I do n't  want to lose him . Please reply <p> Going in today to have lipoma removed . Doing it in the Doctors office . It on the back of the neck area and is maybe the size of a small lemon . Had a CT scan last week . Doc said that it was not deep at all and is confident about removing it . Still the surgery is a 3pm and I am just a little bit scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a little bigger every year . Thanks for the story above and all the posts . <p> Back to Doc today . Hope they will remove the drain ( this is the forth day ) . Its draining about 12cc a day . Not a lot of pain but I am worried about the swelling . The lipmoa was about 6.5cm long . And maybe that round also . <p> Hi DB , How are you doing now ? May I ask who did the surgey , a general surgeon or plastic surgeon ? I have one on my neck at similar size . I am so afraid about the possible nerve damage . I am in DC area . Any suggestions ? Thanks . <p> I have small lump did n't  take notice , my husband even told me to have it check , until I asked a nurse friend to feel it and said I needed this lump to be removed . I checked in the Internet and read about your story , I am thinking of making an appointment to have it seen and check in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feels like a small hard tiny ball in my upper thigh ; ( . Let 's wait for the physicians to decide . <p> I recently diagnosed with a large lipoma located intramuscularly in the adductor brevis muscle inside the right thigh . It was found after I was hospitalised with severe abdominal pain located in the groin on top of my thigh and following a CT scan and MRI . I am trying to find a consultant to examine me to see what procedure and treatment needed and I can not find anyne in my area . Like everyone with lipomas most doctors just think they are simple conditions that need no medical intervention . They do n't  even realise that lipomas are painful and complicated depending on where they are . More work and medical research need to be done on lipomas <p> I was due to have a cyst the size of a walnut on my shoulder and a lipoma removed from my abdomen a couple of months ago on the same day . The cyst was removed under a local , but the surgeon started having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've had that done now and its all fine so I 'm due to have the lipoma removed next week under a local which due to its location I 'm really not looking forward to . The wound from the cyst extraction healed up quite nicely and stitches were removed after 9 days . The 2 inch scar does n't  seem to be looking any better though <p> i ad cyst removed on 31st of july all went well but now been referred to a different hos because they found sum thing in cyst i 'm soo scared does any one no wat it could be cause all i 'm thinking is the big C word y else wud i be referred hope sum 1 can but my mind at rest xx <p> I have several ( 15 -20 I guess ) lipomas . I had a few small marble sized lipomas removed from midrif area in office procedure small scars , no problems afterward . Last year I had a lump on my back just under bra line about 2 inches from spine . It bothered me everytime I would sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch my back ! So onto the Dr. We planned for the surgery and planned general anesthesia because of the location . Surgery went well 2 hours and it turned out to be 10 cm ( tennis ball ) and attached to muscles and tissue . To make a Longer story shorter .

@@119850944 @8850944/ <p> When taking photos with a digital camera it is useful to know how many photos will fit on your memory card ( SD , Memory Stick Duo , USB , etc ) , and know how large the JPEG images are . <p> There are a lot of tables out there showing this kind of information .

It can for example make the difference between your photo being 2MB in size or being 4MB in size . <p> This graph shows the JPEG photo size when using low compression ( which I 'm defining as 10:1 ) and high compression ( which I 'm defining as 20:1 ) . <p> My second graph shows how many photos you can fit on a 4GB card .

@@119850946 @8850946/ <p> Enzymes such as Catalase are protein molecules which are found in living cells . They are used to speed up specific reactions in the cells . They are all very specific as each enzyme just performs one particular reaction . <p> Catalase is an enzyme found in food such as potato and liver . It is used for removing Hydrogen Peroxide from the cells . Hydrogen Peroxide is the poisonous by-product of metabolism . Catalase speeds up the decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide into water and oxygen as shown in the equations below . <h> Formula : <p> It is able to speed up the decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide because the shape of it 's active site matches the shape of the Hydrogen Peroxide molecule . This type of reaction where a molecule is broken down into smaller pieces is called an anabolic reaction . <p> To test out how the concentration of hydrogen peroxide affects the rate of reaction first set up the apparatus below . <p> Aparatus picture not reproduced <p> 1 . Add 2cm3 of yeast to one test tube . Add 4cm3 of hydrogen peroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube . Use a pipette to measure out the volumes . It is very important to accurately measure the amounts of Hydrogen Peroxide , Yeast and water to ensure a fair test . <p> 2 . Pour the hydrogen peroxide solution into the test tube containing the yeast and immediately put the gas syringe bung on the end of the test tube , at the same time start the stopwatch . <p> 3 . Bubbles should start to rise up the tube and the gas syringe will move outwards , as soon as the gas syringe passes the 30cm3 mark stop the stopwatch and note the elapsed time down to the nearest 1/10th of a second . <p> 4 . Repeat the experiment with hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 16% , 12% , 10% , 8% , 4% and 0% . The 0% concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution is done as a control solution to show that at 0% concentration no reaction occurs . The different concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide are made by adding tap water to the 20% Hydrogen Peroxide in the correct amounts . The table below shows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solutions . <p> Concentration Of Hydrogen Peroxide <p> Volume Of Hydrogen Peroxide ( cm3 ) <p> Volume Of Water ( cm3 ) <p> 20% <p> 4 <p> 0 <p> 16% <p> 3.2 <p> 0.8 <p> 12% <p> 2.4 <p> 1.6 <p> 10% <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> 8% <p> 1.6 <p> 2.4 <p> 4% <p> 0.8 <p> 3.2 <p> 0% <p> 0 <p> 4 <p> 5 . Repeat all the tests at least three times so that an average can be obtained . Repeating the experiments several times will help to produce better and more accurate results as any inaccuracies in one experiment should be compensated for by the other experiments . Note all the results in a table such as the one below . <p> Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration <p> 0% <p> 4% <p> 8% <p> 10% <p> 12% <p> 16% <p> 20% <p> Time Taken ( Test 1 ) <p> Time Taken ( Test 2 ) <p> Time Taken ( Test 3 ) <p> Average of the Tests <p> Rate <p> The rate can then be worked out by <p> Rate=30/Average Time <p> This gives the rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am timing how long it takes to produce 30cm3 of oxygen . From these results a graph can be plotted with concentration on the x-axis and time taken on the y-axis . <p> I am using yeast catalase as opposed to catalase from apples , potatoes or liver because it is easier to get the desired amount of yeast catalase by simply measuring it off . To obtain catalase from a substance such as potato would involve crushing it and with that method you would never be sure of the concentration of the catalase . If the catalase was used up then another potato would have to be crushed and this could produce catalase of a totally different concentration which would lead to inaccuracies in the experiment making this an unfair test . <p> To ensure this is a fair test all the variables except for the concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide must be kept the same for all the experiments . Variables that must not be altered include : - <p> I predict that as the substrate concentration increases , the rate of reaction will go up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substrate hydrogen peroxide . When this saturation point is reached , then adding extra substrate will make no difference . <p> The rate steadily increases when more substrate is added because more of the active sites of the enzyme are being used which results in more reactions so the required amount of oxygen is made more quickly . Once the amount of substrate molecules added exceeds the number of active sites available then the rate of reaction will no longer go up . This is because the maximum number of reactions are being done at once so any extra substrate molecules have to wait until some of the active sites become available . <p> All the times are in seconds . The average results are all written down to one decimal place because although the stopwatch gives results to two decimal places it is impossible to get accurate times to two decimal places due to the fact that our reaction times are not fast enough to stop the stopwatch precisely . I then worked out the rates of the reactions with the equation <p> Rate=30/Average Time <p> From these rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reaction against concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide . <p> When the concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide is increased , the rate of reaction increases at a directly proportional rate until the concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide reaches about 16% . If you double the concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide then the rate of reaction doubles as well . When the concentration is doubled from 8-16% the rate goes up from 1.65-2.97 Cm3 Oxygen produced per second , which is an increase of 1.8 times . I would expect the rate to increase two times if the Hydrogen Peroxide concentration is increased two times because there are twice as many substrate molecules which can join onto the enzymes active sites . The reason that the number is less than two times could be put down to the fact that at 16% the Enzyme 's active sites may already be close to being saturated with Hydrogen Peroxide . There may also be some experimental error which causes the inaccuracies . <p> After 16% the increase in the rate of reaction slows down . This is shown by the gradient of the graph going down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the active sites are said to be saturated with Hydrogen Peroxide . Increasing the Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration after the point of saturation has been reached will not cause the rate of reaction to go up any more . All the active sites are being used so any extra Hydrogen Peroxide molecules will have to wait until an active site becomes available . <p> The theoretical maximum rate of reaction is when all the sites are being used but in reality this theoretical maximum is never reached due to the fact that not all the active sites are being used all the time . The substrate molecules need time to join onto the enzyme and to leave it so the maximum rate achieved is always slightly below the theoretical maximum . The time taken to fit into and leave the active site is the limiting factor in the rate of reaction . <p> To help make this experiment more accurate , I repeated it three times and then used the average of all the results to plot a graph with a line of best fit . I tried to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for all the experiments . However , in reality it is impossible to keep all the variables precisely the same . For example : <p> a ) There is a slight delay between pouring the Hydrogen Peroxide into the yeast , putting the bung on and starting the stopwatch . This will slightly affect all the results but as I carried out all the three steps in the same way for all the experiments it should not make any difference to the overall result . <p> b ) It is also impossible to precisely measure out the amounts of Hydrogen Peroxide , Yeast and Water each time . As the scale on the pipettes shows the volume to the nearest mm3 the volume of the solutions that I used should be correct to the nearest mm3 . The volume of gas in the test tube to start with is slightly affected by the amount which the bung is pushed down each time , if the bung is pushed down further then the volume in the tube will be less so the 30cm3 of gas is reached faster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reactions it is only possible to measure the time of the reaction to the nearest 0.1 second even though the stopwatch shows the measurements to the nearest 0.01 second . <p> The plotted results on the graph produce a straight line of best fit to begin with which then goes into a curve of steadily decreasing gradient . The only anomalies are the results at 8% and 10% . The result at 8% is slightly above the line of best fit and the 10% result is slightly below it . This is probably due to an experimental error involving one of the factors mentioned above . <p> This experiment could be improved in a number of ways . It could be repeated more times to help get rid of any anomalies . A better overall result would be obtained by repeating the experiment more times because any errors in one experiment should be compensated for by the other experiments . <p> Using more concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide would have produced a better looking graph and I would have liked to use concentrations higher than 20% to extend the graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached . <p> The problem of the delay between pouring in the Hydrogen Peroxide , bunging the test tube and starting the stopwatch could have been limited by getting another person to start the stopwatch when the hydrogen peroxide was poured into the tube . <h> Disclaimer <p> This is a real A-level school project and as such is intended for educational or research purposes only .

The bits at the front get you onto the boat . And the yellow bit at the back shows that I have paid extra for the cabin . <p> Boarding the A-Line ferry <p> Boarding was at 6:30am so I still had a little time to wait .

@@119850948 @8850948/ <p> I am planning to use two methods to measure how the population of yeast changes over time . Method 1 uses a haemocytometer whilst method 2 uses a colorimeter to measure the number of yeast cells each day . <p> A haemocytometer is a microscope slide which has an etched grid on it . It consists of a 1mm square known as a A square which is divided into 25 B squares which have an area of 0.04mm . These B squares are each divided into 16 C squares which have an area of 0.0025mm . <p> A colorimeter is a machine that is used to see how much light can pass through a liquid . It shows how much light is being transmitted through a sample of liquid . As the number of cells gets higher , less light will be transmitted through the sample . Special thin walled test tubes are used in the colorimeter so that they do not affect the amount of light passing through the sample . <p> To prepare the yeast solution do the following steps . <p> 1 . Measure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask . Cider is used to provide food for the yeast to grow in . <p> 2 . Using a 1cm pipette carefully measure out 1mm of yeast suspension and add it to the conical flask containing the cider . <p> 3 .

The change in yeast population can then be measured by using a haemocytometer and by using a colorimeter . <p> The Haemocytometer Test <p> 1 . First set up the microscope , place the cover slip on the haemocytometer slide between the two grooves and put the slide on the microscope . <p> 2 . A drop of yeast solution should be taken from the conical flask using a dropper pipette and put next to the cover slip . The yeast solution will be drawn under the cover slip by capillary reaction . <p> 3 . Focus the microscope so that you can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of yeast cells that you can see in 10 randomly picked squares . Note down all these results in a table such as the <p> 9 <p> 10 <p> Average <p> Day 1 <p> Day 2 <p> Day 3 <p> Day 4 <p> Day 5 <p> Day 6 <p> This haemocytometer test should be repeated daily for about two weeks . The results in the table can then be plotted into a graph . <p> The Colorimeter Test <p> The number of cells can be measured by with a colorimeter using the following method . <p> 1 . Calibrate the colorimeter by pouring 3cm of plain cider into a colorimeter test tube and placing the test tube into the colorimeter . Adjust the colorimeter so that with the plain cider it is showing 100% light transmission . Take the plain cider test tube out of the machine . <p> 2 .

Pour the yeast solution back into the conical flask . Put the muslin back on the flask and return it to the 40C oven . <p> Both the haemocytometer and the colorimeter method of measuring the change in yeast cell population should be repeated at daily intervals for roughly two weeks . <p> A graph of Cell Numbers against time can then be plotted using the data . To convert the colorimeter readings to numbers of cells a calibration chart should be used . <p> I predict that as the number of days goes up the number of yeast cells in the solution will go up . This will continue for a number of days until the rate starts to slow down and eventually it will stop going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rate will go up over time because the yeast cells reproduce asexually which means that they are able to reproduce very quickly . They also have the perfect conditions for reproducing . They are being kept at a temperature of 40C which is very near to their optimum living temperature . They have lots of food from the cider and they have a lot of space to reproduce in . The rate will slow down after a while because the yeast will start killing itself off with the alcohol which it produces as part of it 's respiratory process . This is known as a negative feedback reaction . <p> The Experiments - started to carry out the above experiments but after a few days decided to give up on the haemocytometer test because it was too time consuming . I carried out the colorimeter readings as written above and the results can be seen below . In order to get the number of yeast cells produced I am using a calibration curve so that by using the percentage transmission results the number of cells per mm can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment and these results were obtained . To make the colorimeter test as accurate as possible as well as my own results I used six other peoples sets of results and then took the average of each days results to work out how many yeast cells there are per mm using the calibration curve . <p> A graph of the log of the cell numbers against time was plotted . A log graph is used because the increase in the number of cells per mm over the 11 days is so big that it would not be practical to have a graph with numbers that large on it . This graph shows the total cell numbers both living and dead . <p> The number of cells increased as the time went by as I had predicted . It increased as a fairly steady rate which can be seen on the Log graph . The population is able to increase at this rapid rate due to it 's asexual reproduction . When the yeast cell is ready to reproduce a bud starts to grow out from it ? s cell membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break off and become a new yeast cell . This is shown in the diagram below . not reproduced <p> These two yeast cells are then able to reproduce making four cells then eight then sixteen and so on . The yeast cells have plenty of space to grow in and lots of food from the cider . They are also being kept at 40C which is close to their optimum temperature for living . The number of cells does not keep doubling in this way . This is because the cells start to die through natural death and they are also killed by the alcohol which the yeast produce as part of their natural respiration process . <p> From day 3 to 4 the Log number increases from 6.87 to 6.95 which is an increase in cell numbers from 7413102 to 8912509 . This is an increase of 20% for one day . From days 8 to 9 the Log goes up from 7.22 to 7.30 which is an increase in cell numbers from 16595869 to 19952623 which is an increase of 20% for one day . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very steady . <p> After day nine the rate of population increase starts to slow down which is shown by the decreasing gradient on the graph . From day 10 to 11 the Log goes up from 7.37 to 7.41 which shows an increase in cell numbers from 23442288 to 25703958 which is an increase of 9.6% for one day . This is a fairly large drop in the expansion of the population of yeast . The rate of increase from day 10 to 11 is half that of the increase from day 3 to 4 . <p> The rate has started to decrease by 9 and 10 because the yeast is starting to be killed off by the alcohol . This alcohol is produced as a by-product to the yeast 's respiring . The alcohol poisons the yeast which causes it to die . This is known as a negative feedback reaction . The increase in yeast cells numbers leads to less space for them to reproduce so they are having to compete for space . The cells which do n't have enough space will soon die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cider so this could lead them to die . The increase in alcohol and the lack of space starts to kill the cells off and so after 9 to 10 days the rate of increase in cell numbers slows down . If the experiment was continued for a few more days then I would expect the rate to stop as by then all the yeast cells would be dead . <p> The graph plotted of cell numbers does refer to the total number of cells both living and dead . If just the number of living cells was counted then the number of cells would start by rising at a slow rate as reproduction is only just beginning ( Lag Phase ) . The numbers of yeast cells would then rise at a very fast rate before levelling off ( Log Phase ) . By the time C is reached the alcohol levels have built up so the birth rate is equal to the death rate causing the population to remain constant . After D the numbers would then start dropping as the yeast cells die from lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death phase . The theoretical curve is shown below . not reproduced <p> To help make this experiment more accurate , I used seven sets of results and then used the average of all the results to plot a graph with a line of best fit . I tried to keep all the variables the same for all the experiments . However , in reality it is impossible to keep all the variables precisely the same . For example : <p> a ) It is also impossible to precisely measure out the amounts of Yeast or cider when making the solution .

@@119850949 @8850949/ <p> The rate of photosynthesis is affected by a number of factors including light levels , temperature , availability of water , and availability of nutrients . If the conditions that the plant needs are improved the rate of photosynthesis should increase . <p> The maximum rate of photosynthesis will be constrained by a limiting factor . This factor will prevent the rate of photosynthesis from rising above a certain level even if other conditions needed for photosynthesis are improved . This limiting factor will control the maximum possible rate of the photosynthetic reaction . <p> For instance , increasing the temperature from 10C to 20C could double the rate of photosynthesis as the plant 's enzymes will be closer to their optimum working temperature . As the temperature is increased , molecules in the cells will be moving at a faster rate due to kinetic theory . If the temperature is raised above a certain level , the rate of photosynthesis will drop as the plant 's enzymes are denatured . They will therefore be more likely to join onto the enzymes and react . <p> The amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photosynthesis . If the plant does not have enough water , the plant 's stomata will shut and the plant will be deprived of CO . It is difficult in normal lab conditions to prove that water directly affects photosynthesis unless a heavy isotope is used to trace the path of water . <p> Chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis . This can be proved by studying a variegated leaf . It is however very difficult to study how different levels of chlorophyll in the plant will affect it 's photosynthesis rate . This is because in a variegated leaf the cells either contain chlorophyll or they do n't . <p> Carbon dioxide concentration will directly affect the rate of photosynthesis as it is used in the photosynthesis reaction . It is also easy to change the amount of carbon dioxide that the plant receives . <p> Light is also directly used in the photosynthesis reaction and is easy to change in normal lab conditions . Carbon Dioxide and Light are the factors that I will change in the experiment as they are easy to change and measure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photosynthesis , such as how much the amount of CO2 decreases over time . This is however difficult in normal lab conditions . I will instead measure how one of the products of photosynthesis ( oxygen ) increases over time . I am planning to use the following method for my experiment . <p> The apparatus is set up as below with the syringe full of the 0.01M solution of NaHCO3 solution . Two marks 10cm apart are made on the capillary tubing . <p> The syringe is placed 0.05m away from the lamp . <p> Using the syringe plunger the meniscus of the NaHCO3 is set so that it is level with the first mark . <p> A stopwatch is then started . The meniscus should gradually move down the capillary tube as the elodea produces oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis . As the oxygen is produced it increases the pressure in the syringe and so the meniscus is pushed down the tube . <p> When the meniscus reaches the level of the bottom mark the stopwatch should be stopped and the time should be noted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NaHCO3 <p> Light Intensity 1/d ( m ) <p> 0.00 ( Distilled water ) <p> 0.01 <p> 0.02 <p> 0.05 <p> 0.07 <p> 0.1 <p> 400 <p> 278 <p> 204 <p> 156 <p> 100 <p> 25 <p> 11 <p> 4 <p> The light intensities have been worked out using the following equation <p> Light Intensity = 1 / Distance ( m ) <p> 6 . Using the same piece of elodea and the same distance between the lamp and the syringe the experiment ( steps 1 to 5 ) should be repeated for the other concentration of NaHCO3. 7 . The experiment ( steps 1 to 6 ) should then be repeated at each different distance between the syringe and the light for all the NaHCO3 concentrations . The remaining distances are 0.05m , 0.06m , 0.07m , 0.08m , 0.1m , 0.2m , 0.3m , and 0.5m. 8 . The entire experiment should then be repeated three times in order to obtain more accurate data and to get rid of any anomalies that may occur in a single experiment . <p> Measuring the volume of oxygen is more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a different size . In order to make this experiment as accurate as possible a number of steps must be taken . <p> The experiment should be carried out in darkness with only the light from the bench lamp reaching the elodea . <p> The same piece of elodea should be used each time in order to make sure that each experiment is being carried out with the same leaf surface area . <p> The amount of NaHCO3 solution should be the same for each experiment . 20mm should be used each time . <p> The lamp should be at the same height for each experiment . It should be level with the syringe each time . <p> The distance should be measured from the front of the lamp to the syringe . Although taking these steps will make the experiment more accurate , it 's accuracy is still limited by several factors . <p> Some of the oxygen will be used for photosynthesis by the plant . <p> Some of the oxygen will dissolve into the water . <p> From these recorded times I will work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rate Of the Reaction = 1 / Time ( s ) <p> Using these rates I plan to plot a graph of the rate of reaction against light intensity . <h> Light <p> I predict that if the light intensity increases the rate of the reaction will increase at a proportional rate until a certain level is reached , the rate of increases will then go down . Eventually a level will be reached where increasing the light intensity will have no more effect on the rate of reaction as there is some other limiting factor . <p> Light is needed for photosynthesis in plants . When chloroplasts in the leaf 's cell are exposed to light they synthesise ATP from ADP . Oxygen is produced as a by-product of the photosynthesis reaction . Therefore increasing the concentration of light will increase the amount of ATP being synthesised from ADP and so more oxygen will be released as a by product . <h> NaHCO3 <p> I predict that as the concentration of NaHCO3 increases the rate of the reaction will increase at a proportional rate . Eventually increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors will be limiting the rate of photosynthesis . Carbon dioxide is needed for the photosynthesis reaction . It is used to make the organic products of photosynthesis . If the elodea is able to absorb more CO2 then the rate of photosynthesis will increase as the plant is able to make more of the organic compounds . The plant is given CO2 in the form of NaHCO3 . <p> Pooled results from the group were used .

It shows how the amount of CO2 and light affect the rate of photosynthesis . Lines of best fit were drawn for each CO2 concentration to make up for any inaccuracy in any individual result . The line of best fit gives a good picture of how the overall rate of reaction is affected by the light and CO2 . <p> I will analyse the results for how the amount of light and CO2 affects the rate of photosynthesis . <p> My prediction that the rate of photosynthesis would go up if the light intensity and NaHCO3 levels were increased proved correct . As the elodea absorbed the light and CO2 it produced oxygen gas which increased the pressure in the syringe . This pushed the air bubble in the capillary tube down . The chloroplasts produce ATP and reduce NADP to NADPH2 when exposed to light . It is at this stage of the reaction that oxygen is produced as a waste product . <p> As predicted when the light intensity increases so does the rate of photosynthesis . I predicted that a level would be reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rate of reaction as there would be some other limiting factor which limits the rate of the reaction . The rate increases at a steady rate as the light intensity increases until near the end of each line where the rate of increase decreases . This is either because the photosynthesis reaction has reached it 's maximum rate of reaction or another factor is limiting the rate . As 6 different CO2 concentrations were used I can see that the first five reactions are not occurring at their maximum rate as there is the 0.1M NaHCO3 rest which is occurring at a faster rate then the other 5 . The photosynthesis reactions of the other five test must therefore be limited by the concentration of CO2 to the plant . <p> As predicted when the NaHCO3 concentration is increased the plant in able to get more CO2 which causes the rate of reaction to go up . I predicted that once the NaHCO3 had been raised above a certain level increasing the rate further would have no effect as there would be other limiting factors limiting the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was increased the rate of photosynthesis was able to go up . The plant therefore made more oxygen as a waste product . At a NaHCO3 concentration of 0.1M once the light intensity gets above 300 the rate of reaction slows down very quickly . This could be because photosynthesis is occurring at it 's maximum possible rate or because another limiting factor is limiting the rate of reaction . <h> Distilled Water <p> With the distilled water the rate of reaction went up from 0.1 to 0.4 when the light intensity was increased from 100 to 400 . This is a 4 times rise which is quite large . The curve on the graph does however level out quite soon showing that the rate is being limited by the lack of NaHCO3 in the water . <h> 0.01M NaHCO3 <p> At a light intensity of 4 the rate is 0.06 but this rises to 0.6 when the light intensity is brought up to 400 . The curve is very shallow and levels off towards a light intensity of 350 - 400. <h> 0.02M NaHCO3 <p> The amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rate also finishes off twice that of the 0.01M experiment . This would surgest that there was a directly proportional relationship between the amount of NaHCO3 and the rate of reaction . <h> 0.05M NaHCO3 <p> The curve for the 0.05M NaHCO3 is steeper than the previous curves . The rate rises to 1.9 at a light intensity of 400. <h> 0.07M NaHCO3 <p> The 0.07M NaHCO3 test produces a line which is steeper than all the previous curves . The plant is using the extra CO2 to photosynthesise more . As the plant has more CO2 the limiting factor caused by the lack of CO2 is reduced . This test did produce a big anomaly . The rate for a light intensity of 400 is 5 . By following the line of best fit I can see that this result should be more like 3.5 . The elodea for this test was very close to the light source . It is possible that it had been left here for a while which caused the lamp to heat the elodea up . This would have increased the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photosynthesis rate . <h> 0.1M NaHCO3 <p> The 0.1M NaHCO3 produced the steepest line . Near the end of the line it looks as if the rate of reaction is hit by another limiting factor . The line goes up steadily but then between a light intensity of 300 and 400 levels off very quickly . This would surgest that at a 0.1M NaHCO3 is sufficient for the plant to photosynthesise at it 's maximum rate with it 's current environmental conditions . Increasing the NaHCO3 concentration after this level would therefore have no effect unless the next limiting factor was removed . <p> The fact that the curve levels off so quickly indicates that there is another limiting factor limiting the photosynthesis . It could be temperature . These tests are being carried out at room temperature so the temperature would have to be raised another 15C before the enzymes in the plant 's cells were at their optimum working temperature . More tests could be done by using water that was at a higher temperature to see what effect this would have on the photosynthesis rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without affect other factors . For instance the actual amount of oxygen released by the plant is slightly more than the readings would surgest as some of the oxygen would dissolve into the water . At a higher temperature less oxygen would be able to dissolve into the water so the readings for the photosynthesis rate could be artificially increased . <p> It is also possible that the photosynthetic reactions in the plant are occurring at their maximum possible rate and so can not be increased any more . <p> The light is probably not a limiting factor as all but one of the curves level off before the maximum light intensity of 400 is reached . The maximum light intensity that the plants can handle is therefore just below 400 . <p> Water will not be a limiting factor as the plants are living in water . They therefore have no stomata and absorb all their CO2 by diffusion through the leaves . <p> Some was used by small invertebrates that were found living within the pieces of elodea . <p> The higher light intensities should be quite accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light spreads out . the elodea will also get background light from other experiments . <p> The lights are also a source of heat which will affect the experiments with only a small distance between the light and the syringe. this heating could affect the results . <p> Using the same piece of elodea for each experiment was impractical as the elodea 's photosynthesis rate decreased over time . By using a different piece of elodea for each experiment did create the problem of it being impossible for each piece to have the same surface area . <p> As the tests took place over a two day period there will be some inaccuracy caused by factors such as temperature . There was no practical way for the long tests to be kept at a totally constant temperature for the two day period and they will probably have cooled down at night and then warmed up in the day leading to a slight inaccuracy . <p> It could be repeated more times to help get rid of any anomalies . A better overall result would be obtained by repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compensated for by the other experiments . <p> Each person should have done their experiments in a different room to cut out all background light . <p> All the experiments should be done sequentially . <p> A perspex screen could have been placed between the light and the syringe to reduce any heating effect that the light may have . <p> The experiment could have been carried out with higher NaHCO3 to see if increasing the concentration would increase the rate of photosynthesis , or if a concentration of 0.1M NaHCO3 produces the maximum rate of photosynthetic reaction . <h> Disclaimer <p> This is a real A-level school project and as such is intended for educational or research purposes only .

@@119850951 @8850951/ <p> The surface area to volume ratio in living organisms is very important . Nutrients and oxygen need to diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cells . Most cells are no longer than 1mm in diameter because small cells enable nutrients and oxygen to diffuse into the cell quickly and allow waste to diffuse out of the cell quickly . If the cells were any bigger than this then it would take too long for the nutrients and oxygen to diffuse into the cell so the cell would probably not survive . <p> Single celled organisms can survive as they have a large enough surface area to allow all the oxygen and nutrients they need to diffuse through . Larger multi celled organisms need specialist organs to respire such as lungs or gills . <p> Cresol red dye is an acid / alkali indicator dye . In the alkali conditions of the gelatin it is red or purple but when it gets exposed to acid it turns a light yellow colour . <p> Gelatin is used for these tests as it is permeable and so it acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required sizes and the hydrochloric acid can diffuse at an even rate through it . <p> I am not using any blocks bigger than 20 x 20 x 20 as a preliminary test found that it was only practical to use blocks of 20mm or less as anything bigger than this would take longer than the amount of time that we have to do the experiment . <p> 2 . A small beaker was filled with 100cm of 0.1 molar Hydrochloric acid . This is a sufficient volume of acid to ensure that all the block sizes are fully covered in acid when dropped into the beaker . <p> 3 . One of the blocks is dropped into this beaker and the time for all the red dye to disappear is noted in a table such as the one below . <p> Dimensions ( mm ) <p> Surface Area <p> Volume ( mm ) <p> Surface Area / Volume Ratio <p> Test 1 <p> Test 2 <p> Test 3 <p> Average Time <p> 4 . This test should be repeated for all the sizes of blocks three times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each block to ensure that this does not affect the experiment ? s results . <p> 5 . The surface area / volume ratio and an average of the results can then be worked out . A graph of Time against Surface Area to Volume Ratio can then be plotted . From this graph we will be able to see how the surface area affects the time taken for the hydrochloric acid to penetrate to the centre of the cube . <p> I predict that as the Surface Area / Volume Ratio increases the time taken for the hydrochloric acid to penetrate to the centre of the cube will go down . This is because a small block has a large amount of surface area compared to it ? s volume so the hydrochloric acid will have a large surface area to diffuse through . A larger block has a smaller amount of surface area in relation to it ? s size so it should take longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse into the centre of the cube . The actual rate of the hydrochloric acid diffusing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when the surface area / volume ratio goes up it will take less time for the hydrochloric acid to reach the centre of the cube . <p> In all the blocks of gelatin the rate of penetration of the hydrochloric acid from each side would have been the same but all the blocks take different amounts of time to clear because they are different sizes . As the blocks get bigger it takes longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse through all the block and so clear the dye . It takes longer to reach the centre of the cube even though the rate of diffusion is the same for all the cubes . <p> As the volume of the blocks goes up the Surface Area / Volume ratio goes down . The larger blocks have a smaller proportion of surface area than the smaller blocks . The smallest block has 1.4mm of surface area for every 1mm of volume . The largest block only has 0.3mm of surface area for each 1mm of volume . This means that the hydrochloric acid is able to diffuse to the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The acid took 48 minutes to diffuse to the centre of the largest block but only 1 minute in the smallest block . A living cell would not survive if it had to wait 48 minutes for oxygen to diffuse through it so living cells need to be very small . <p> When the surface area to volume ratio goes down it takes longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse into the cube but if the ratio goes up then the hydrochloric acid diffuses more quickly into the block of gelatin . Some shapes have a larger surface area to volume ratio so the shape of the object can have an effect on the rate of diffusion . <p> It is important that cells have a large surface area to volume ratio so that they can get enough nutrients into the cell . They can increase their surface area by flattening and becoming longer or by having a rough surface with lots of folds of cell membrane known as villi. picture not reproduced <p> The villi vastly increase the surface area of the cell whereas the cell which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? s volume . Both cells above have an volume of 1cm . The cell on the left has a surface area of 3cm but the cell on the right with villi has a surface area of 10cm . The cell membrane is made up of a lipid bi-layer with many proteins integrated into it . picture not reproduced <p> Oxygen can diffuse easily through the membrane and Carbon Dioxide and other waste products can easily dissolve out . The concentration of oxygen in the cell is always lower than outside the cell which causes the oxygen to diffuse in . Gases will always dissolve from an area of high to low pressure . The concentration of carbon dioxide outside the cell is lower than the concentration in the cell so the carbon dioxide will always dissolve out of the cell . <p> Single celled organisms such as amoebas have a large surface area to volume ratio because they are so small . They are able to get all the oxygen and nutrients they need by diffusion through the cell membrane . <p> Larger organisms such as mammals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need special systems such as the lungs in order to get enough oxygen . Surface area to volume ratio is very important in lungs where a large amount of oxygen has to get into the lungs . The lungs have a very large surface area because they contain millions of sacs called alveoli which allow oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream . By having millions of these alveoli the lungs are able to cram a very large surface area into a small space . This surface area is sufficient for all the oxygen we need to diffuse through it and to let the carbon dioxide out . <p> To help make this experiment more accurate , I repeated it three times for each block size and then used the average of all the results to plot a graph with a line of best fit . I tried to keep all the variables except for the size of the gelatin blocks the same for all the experiments . However , in reality it is impossible to keep all the variables precisely the same . For example : <p> a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gelatin block each time . I measured the sizes to the nearest mm so the sizes of block that I used should be correct to the nearest mm . <p> b ) When the gelatin blocks are dropped into the beakers the base of the block comes into contact with the bottom of the beaker which reduces the surface area of the block that comes into contact with the hydrochloric acid . <p> c ) The results will be slightly inaccurate as the moment when the gelatin block has lost all it ? s dye is a matter of opinion and not something that can be measured precisely . <p> d ) Due to the fairly slow speed of our reactions it is only possible to measure the time of the reaction to the nearest 0.1 second even though the stopwatch shows the measurements to the nearest 0.01 second . <p> The graph produced shows a smooth curve with a decreasing gradient as the surface area to volume ratio goes up . The only anomaly is the result for the 5 x 5 x 5 block . The result here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph . The results for the 5 x 5 x 5 block ranged from 4.53 to 7.02 seconds with an average of 6.15 seconds . The line of best fit for the graph suggests that the average should be around 3 seconds . The anomalous result was probably due to experimental error as a result of this being the first block size that I used in the experiment . The most likely explanation is that I was unsure of how to judge when all the dye had disappeared and as a result delayed pressing the stop button of the stop watch . As the experiment progressed with the other block sizes I probably got better at making this judgement . <p> 1 ) It could be repeated more times to help get rid of any anomalies . A better overall result would be obtained by repeating the experiment more times because any errors in one experiment should be compensated for by the other experiments . <p> 2 ) Using more shapes and sizes of gelatin block would have produced a better looking graph . <p> 3 ) Variables that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of diffusion may also be affected by temperature , strength of acid and volume of acid <p> 4 ) The block could be suspended in the hydrochloric acid so than none of it ? s surfaces are in contact with the wall of the beaker . A small cradle could be used to suspend the blocks in the acid which would mean that all six sides of the cube should be in contact with the acid .

I am working my way through about 10 certified copies of my marriate certificate and have found that some banks will certify one copy if its for something related to them but others ( inc. my local Halifax ) will take a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : o ( <p> Im stuck with the final 3 ( not related to any banks ) so will definately give the post office a go ! <p> The fee to certify a document by a solicitor is -5 the -2 is charged per exhibit attached to the document so you 'll never find a solicitor who will do it for -2 , sorry . Not sure why you were quoted -70 -80 that is the sort of fee for a notary . Hope that clarifies it for you . <p> I am banging my head against the same problem to close my dead mothers accounts where proof of identity is required . My bank ( alliance and Leicester ) used to certify copies but now refuse for external use , and my mothers bank wont certify unless they know me personally . The assurance company will check through Experian who check things like register of electors , but I have just moved , so the register is not up to date for me . <p> I spoke to the assurance company who are asking for the certified copies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at my risk . So as the card part of my driving licence is ok for them , it is on its way , recorded delivery . Sorted ! <p> A few tips . The Post Office will certify it is a standard service . However , print off the web page which says that they do it , and take it with you , otherwise you will meet with blank faces and an absolute assurance that they can not certify copies . Also , find out if the requestor has a local agent who can certify the copy for you that should be free . Try approaching the solicitor who did the conveyancing on your house worked for me , and it was free . However , rest assured that the whole process is frustrating in the extreme . <p> Just a note of caution re the post-office ID-check service depending on what you 're doing , it might not be good enough . <p> I 've used it successfully a few times , and thought I now had a reasonably easy way to provide certified I 'd whenever necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-office-certified copies to a distant solicitor that were dealing with , and its been rejected as not meeting the requirements . <p> Apparently the current money-laundering legislation has very preicse requirements , and the post-office I 'd service does n't  meet these . It has to be done by solicitor or similar . Think this is because it has to be someone that is trained/registered for this legislation , also they have to provide individual name and contact details so it can be tied back to them ( and it has to be possible for the recipient to contact them if necessary ) . A stamp and initials from post-office counter is n't enough . <p> It seems ridiculous that we have this strict legislation but apparently no provision for how " normal " people are supposed to satisfy it and a post-office service that isnt good enough to satisfy the rules . <p> Anyway , Im now hunting for a local solicitor that is willing to do it and wo n't charge too much . <p> Mikes posting is an accurate lay summary of the issue . Any legally qualified person can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to the local county court offices , where they you would be possibly assist , for the prescribed fee -5.00 and -2.00 for each attachment . Be prepared for a possible queue , county court office staff are underpaid and overworked . <p> As a practising barrister I do provide this service through the post at Berwyn House Chambers 151 Tennyson Road bedfordshire LU1 3RP <p> Simply post docs along with instructions , SAE and Check with guarentee number with exp date , on the back for the total amount due . The charge is the prescribed fee for each doc requiring original certification , and any cost to you for posting and the SAE ; eg , Qualification cert , and a transcript is two original docs in their own right . <p> My Clerk always gets copies out in the post at close of business on the day received . <p> I think everyone is getting confused here about this " solicitors for -5/-2 " item . <p> Solicitors are obliged to charge a fixed fee of -5 for administering the oath when you swear and affidavit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees only relate to this activity only , not to anything else . <p> You are talking here about CERTIFYING whether a copy is a true copy of an original . For that activity , solicitors can charge whatever they like . <p> Of course , the Post Office can not administer oaths on affidavits/exhibits , but if you can find a cheaper option than a solicitor to certify a copy , then of course you are welcome to do so ! <p> I have just had my Post Office certified I 'd document rejected by an overseas bank so the PO is not always acceptable . I am now back to searching for a cheap alternative- very frustrating ! Another badly thought through requirement <p> The Post Office service complies with the anti money laundering regulations ie if you need this service for say opening / transferring a share ISA or other bank account . Of course they operate ISAs etc themeselves . The form is stamped and signed and complies with the regulations . The second post above neatly provides the answer in this useful thread . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  give out this useful and clear information themselves . As regards the electoral roll there are two versions ( 1 ) open to everyone and ( 2 ) a version not open to everyone which you can request to be on . If you are on the second , when you try to transfer an ISA or open a bank account , you may run into this problem , even if your address / name already verified by the first institution has not changed . It is a pity the Electoral Roll is misused in this way eg by BBC Television Licencing and junk mailers , credit reference companies . It should simply be used for one thing an electoral roll . The Government should keep a central register of names / addresses to comply with anti money laundering regulations instead of all this palaver . <p> I am trying to open an account with Barnsley building Soc . They say that copies must include the wording " certified true copy " the Post office say they will write " this copy is a true likeness " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not acceptable . I do not know if I can get the Post Office to change the wording , but I doubt it . <p> They charged -2 for each page signed . It was quick an easy ( and cheap ) . The solicitor I dealt with was charming . I might use them for the conveyancing on my property so theyll get something nice out of it too . <p> I 'm a Solicitor and believe we can charge what we like for certifified copies . I never charge because I only ever certify for friends ( or friends of friends etc ) . The process takes a very short time so if I were you just pop in to your small local high street Solicitors and ask , many will be happy to do it on the spot . If you are quoted a higher fee then haggle with them and go elsewhere . If you use a postal service you will want to pay for recorded delivery both ways . <p> I would also agree that when posting personal and valuable documents it is safest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certificate of posting , this can then be used as proof of postage . <p> Thank you for writing this postIve just come back from Royal Bank of Scotland where they declared they could only certify me if I was applying for a mortgage- no matter that I had an account with them ! <p> Much obliged &amp; thanks for the info , as I had already phoned around and had difficulty to get a soilicitor in Bham where I live who does this . Finally booked an appointment with one who was going to charge -10 per doc . Hence a great saving of -23 by going to the post office . <p> Applying for an Amex card . Their requirements are absurd . Not only must the copy state that it is a true copy of the original but that the photographic image on the document/original is a true likeness of the actual person . The solicitor I went to refused to commit to that and would only certify the copy of the passport I had . Sending that in but half expect to be turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Anyone else have this problem ? <p> Need to apparently send in a certified copy of my Passport to the National Insurance People so that they can age verify me so that they can issue an Age Exception Certificate so that I do not have to pay NI any more and the specifically stated they willl NOT accept a postmasters signature but I culd go into a Job Cemntre and get any old tom dick or harry to verify it ! ! !

You just saved me over -200 ! : ) I needed my university certificates ( x2 ) and a transcript copy certified and notary in London quoted me as -60 each certficate copy , or -90 if 2 done together and -135 for transcript !

@@119850963 @8850963/ <p> Floorboard squeaks and creaks can be very annoying but there are a few ways you can try to fix them . <h> Screwing floorboards down <p> If individual floorboards are squeaking one potential solution is to screw them down to the joists . You 'll need to locate where the joists are . This is usually very easy as you can see the existing nails/screws that are holding the floorboards to the joists . <p> When screwing into floorboards you need to be very careful to avoid any water/gas/electricity supply cables/pipes . You can use a pipe detector to help you locate them . <p> If you put screws very close to the existing nails there is less chance of hitting anything important . <p> I used a mix of 1.5 inch and 2 inch wood screws . They need to be long enough to go through the floorboard and into the joist . <p> After locating which floorboard was squeaking I drilled a pilot hole . I used a drill bit with an attachment that drills the countersink at the same time . I set the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill through the floorboard , and not into the joist . <p> Then I could pop the screw into the hole and use another drill to drive it into the joist . It can be very useful to have two drills , one for drilling holes , and one for screwing down the screws . This can save a lot of bit swapping . <p> I found this method to be effective where an individual floorboard was squeaking . I did n't find it helped in the case where a joist was squeaking . <h> Expanding foam filler <p> Where an individual floorboard was squeaking the noise was limited to that floorboard . In some cases the squeak was activated across the joist along a series of floorboards . For these squeaks screwing down the floorboards did n't seem to remove the squeak as it did n't  prevent the joist from moving . <p> I tried a different technique . I got some large expanding foam filler canisters . Either 750ml or 825ml . These cost from -8--11 each . <p> I then drilled a hole next to the creaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hole does not go into the joist , it goes into the cavity next to the joist . As this is drilling into the floor cavity you have to be especially careful not to hit any pipes or wires . Make sure you use a pipe detector , and do n't drill any further than the depth of the floorboard . You can see a typical hole that I drilled in the photo above . <p> I sprayed in a bit of water ( the instruction on the expanding foam say this is necessary for the foam to cure ) . <p> Then after shaking the can I sprayed the full contents of it into the cavity . Then I left the foam to harden for a few hours . This technique has successfully removed the squeaks from my floorboard joists . <p> It may be a good idea to wait a few weeks before putting down any flooring in case you find any other areas that need treating . <p> I 'm guessing this technique works by immobilising the joist and the surrounding floorboards . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . <p> The space under my floorboards is very small " it is only about 4 inches . This technique may well not work if the space under yours is much larger . <p> I 'm also not sure how long term this solution is . It has now kept the squeaks away for about one month . It is possible that over time the foam will compress and the floorboards will start moving again . I 'll update this post some time in the future with more results .

@@119850966 @8850966/ <p> The last time I reviewed a stand alone GPS data logger it was the GlobalSat DG-100 , a functional but not very stylish box for recording GPS tracks . <p> The new i-gotU GT-600 GPS Travel &amp; Sports Logger from Mobile Action ( disclosure : they sent it to me for free ) has the same SiRF Star III chipset as the DG-100 , but it comes in a smaller and more attractive package . <p> You 'll want a GPS data logger if you want to record your travel and sports tracks ( walking , running , cycling , sailing , etc ) and tag your photos with their GPS locations . Recording this GPS information will allow you to examine your route on the computer later on , and see exactly where you were when you took your photos . <p> i-gotU GT-600 hardware <p> The GPS measures just 46+41.5x14mm and weighs only 37g . It is made of shiny white plastic , and there is a soft plastic case around it ( presumably to protect it if you drop it ) . Here is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And this is what is inside the packaging . You get the GPS data logger , a USB cable , a velcro strap , and a mini install CD . If you have Windows 7 you wo n't need the CD you will have to download the software from their website . <p> Here is a closer look at the sides of the unit . On one side is the cable connection , and on another there is a hole which you could use to attach a wrist strap . <p> Here is the underside of the unit , the holes in the casing are there for you to feed the velcro strap through . <p> The velcro strap allows you to attach the GPS unit to your rucksack , bike , boat , etc . Ideally you should have the unit positioned so that the front faces clear sky . Here is the unit strapped to my bike , ready for a cycle around the city . <p> i-gotU GT-600 in use <p> There is only one button on the GT-600 . Just hold it for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will light up . You then need to wait for 30-60 seconds for it to get a lock on the satellites . <p> How long it takes depends on how many satellites are above visible from your current location , and also on cloud cover . In ideal circumstances it could get a lock in about 30 seconds . The time will also be reduced if it was on in the last few hours as it will still know the positions of some of the satellites . Once it has a lock then both the red and blue lights will start flashing . <p> Once it starts recording you can do whatever you want ; Walk , run , cycle , sail , and it will log your position every 5 seconds . The unit is water resistant so it should be ok to use in the rain . <p> Remember to check the units flashing lights regularly to make it is still recording . It can be very annoying if you get home and realise that only half your journey was recorded because a thick cloud or other GPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The battery lasts about 30 hours if you log every 5 seconds ( longer if you increase the logging interval ) and is charged by the same USB cable that you use to transfer the GPS data . <p> The unit can store 262,000 way points ( locations ) so if it is logging every 5 seconds this will be enough for 363 hours GPS tracks . More than enough for most adventures ! <p> To make the battery and memory go further it has a motion detector built in . If you are still for a while ( perhaps you have stopped for lunch for example ) it will stop recording . They claim that this will give you an extra 20% logging time . <p> Holding the button for a few seconds will turn the unit off . Because the button is easy to press I 'd recommend that you do n't keep the unit in your back pocket . If you do you may well accidently turn it off when you sit down , or bend over . Either keep it strapped to your rucksack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful to place it so that the button wo n't be pressed . I find it works fine when put in the front pocket of my rucksack . The logging might now be quite as accurate as it would be if it had a view of the clear sky , but it is good enough . <p> To sync your data to your PC you just plug it in via the USB cable and start up the @trip PC software . <p> i-gotU software <p> The i-gotU GT-600 GPS data logger comes with three pieces of software . <p> @trip PC which is the software you 'll want to use if you want to manage your trips and geotag your photos . <p> Sports Analyzer which shows your GPS tracks in a view that allows you to easily see average speed , calories burned , and when you did each of your activities . <p> Where I am which simply shows you where you are now on a map . <p> I 've mainly been using @trip PC . After importing the GPS tracks you have the option to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more GPS tracks along with the associated photos . If you have synced multiple tracks you can go back and create new trips for the other tracks later on without having to sync again . <p> You can choose which photos you want to include in the trip . When you 've chosen them the software can add GPS location information into the image . <p> After creating the trip you 'll get something a bit like this . It shows you the route you took , and the locations of all your photos . You can play ' the trip and watch a moving icon go along your route . The photos you took will pop up as the icon reaches them . <p> You can customise the look of your trip . The view above is the basic view , and the one below is a sporty view which shows a graph of your speed and a few sporty facts about your trip such as total distance , and average speed . <p> The @trip PC software is easy and quick to use for viewing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks is an sensible way to delete rogue way points ( sometime you 'll want to manually clean up your tracks a bit ) . You can get a list of all way points , but when you have thousands of them it can take several minutes to find the one you want . The software should ideally let you select one or more way points by clicking on them to allow speedy moving or deletion . <p> In the version of the software I used ( 2010.06.09 ) there were some UI annoyances , and other problem such as slow syncing , and unreliable communication with the hardware on my Windows 7 machine if you have done a sync , you cant delete the data on the device unless you unplug and replug the device back in you get a Failed to clear log data . ( Error=4 ) . But you can work around all these issues . <p> If you are only interested in sports tracking and are n't going to geotag any photos you can use the Sports Analyzer software instead . This is a simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distance , calories burned etc . <p> i-gotU GT-600 advanced configuration <p> Using the @trip PC software there are some advanced options you can configure . You can set the GPS unit to only record at certain times of the day . And you can set how frequently the unit logs your position . <p> Sharing your trip <p> If you do n't just want to keep your trip to yourself you can share it with just a few clicks . The @trip PC software can upload your tracks and photos to the @trip server . You have the option of uploading the photos to the @trip server ( it will shrink the photos for you ) , flickr , or Picasa . <p> Your free @trip account only give you 100mb of space on the @trip server so I 'd recommend creating a free Picasa account to your save your @trip account space for the GPS tracks . A Picasa account will give you 1024mb of photo space .

The unit is small , easy to use , and has worked reliably during my two weeks of testing . The software makes it very simple to view your trips on your PC , geotag your photos , and share them all on the internet . I 'm just hoping they release a software update to sort out the minor problems and bugs that I found . <p> Where to buy <p> If you are in the UK the GT-600 is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked it was slightly cheaper from Maplin . <p> I started having a problem where @trip PC suite would not load ( at all ) . But Sports Analyzer still loaded . I tracked it down to a corrupt sub folder in this resource directory C : **33;36;TOOLONG ActionatripResource . If you are having this same problem and want to try to track down which folder is corrupt . <p> Backup the whole resource folder ( C : **33;71;TOOLONG ActionatripResource ) so you can restore it later . <p> Rename one of the sub folders in this directory and try restarting @trip PC . The corrupt one will probably be one of the ones you 've edited most recently . <p> Repeat until you find the corrupt one . You have found the corrupt one when @trip PC starts . However you 'll now see that in @trip PC all the trips belonging to the resource directories that you renamed have disappeared . <p> Exit @trip PC . <p> Now restore the whole resource folder from your backup , and then delete the corrupt sub folder . <p> Restart @trip PC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt one ) . Youll have to recreate the corrupt trip if you want it back . <p> An extra bit of info if you are digging deeper : A list of the sub folders is stored in C : **33;106;TOOLONG **35;141;TOOLONG . When you successfully manage to load @trip PC again it will delete the entries for the folders that you renamed . You need to restore from your backup ( point 5 above ) so @trip PC knows about the non-corrupt sub folders that you renamed . 213587 @qwx1073587 <h> 21 Responses to " i-gotU GT-600 GPS data logger review " <p> Great review . I have this as a gift -your review gives a much better idea of what you can do with it than the manual does ! A couple of points not covered : 1 How do you delete old trips so that new trips do n't  just fill up the memory ? 2 If you are away for 3 weeks without your PC , how do you charge it up ? Presumably buy a mains charger with a USB socket ? <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC UI . Also the device has a circular buffer recording mode , so it can automatically overwrite old data as new data is recorded . I prefer to delete old data though it seems to sync faster and more reliably with the PC that way . <p> 2 . Yes the battery is sealed inside so you will need access to a computer or USB charger if you are away for a while . <p> cpt jack they claim the the battery lasts about 30 hours ( I 'm not tested this though ) . I 'm not sure from their specs whether that is with the motion detection mode on or off . But I 'm guessing that is with it on , as manufacturers usually quote the best possible battery life . <p> Hi Andre you can export the data as a CSV ( which you can view in Excel ) as long as the data is still on the logger and it is currently plugged in . The software is n't able to export the data as CSV from what is stored on the PC . For reference theses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and accurate reply . Another question popped up in my mind . The specification sheet on the manufacturers website claims the unit supports WAAS and EGNOS . I could n't find any confirmation of this in reviews or forums . If true , does it really improve accuracy ( over western europe , mainly Belgium-France ) without impairing sampling rate or battery discharge rate ? <p> Hi Bach yes it can be used as a GPS if you connect it to a netbook . It can show your position on Google Maps , Bing Maps , or Yahoo ! Maps . However you will need an in-car internet connection for your netbook for this to work . I 've never tested this feature myself so I cant vouch for how well it works . <p> Excellent review , great work , thanks for taking the time to write all this up , its very helpful . <p> I 'm planning a trip to Canada this year and I 'm looking for a device to track my movements and also use this data to geo-tag my photos while i 'm out and about . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not have access to a PC , so I take it I could charge this unit with a USB to mains adaptor but just wondering about the track recording if there is enough room for such a time frame ? <p> Also are you able to export the tracks to GPX file format , I do this for my current tracks and upload these to my Google maps profile , can this be done ? <p> From the @trip PC application you can export the data as both GPX and CSV . <p> The unit can store 262,000 waypoints which should be 363 hours if you record one point per 5 seconds . You can adjust the recording frequency . I 've never tried to record data of this size so I 've no idea how reliable it is . The most I 've recorded is 6-7 hours of data . <p> Hi Rick , I 've found all GPS units Ive tried ( including this one ) are fairly useless at recording altitude . They only work well for longitude/latitude recording . The exception to this is if you are recording a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not quite happy to the sensitivity . I would love to record flight trips and it seems to be quite hard even the unit would be in contact to aircraft passanger window . I know I know , its aircraft glass but in same time my HTC Desire was able to record track . <p> I do n't  know if this IgotU GPS circuit has some altitude &amp; speed restrictions for " not use it as military purposes " as the problems I had seems to be just on high altitudes and speed ( 33000ft @ 1100kmh ground speed ) . Anyone other noticed ? <p> Its very difficult to get info from the IgotU logger if you do n't  use want to use the trip PC software . It would be much better if the company would respond to information queries , support request and the likes . <p> If you you need an easy way to obtain gpx data tracks without running there buggy software then look elsewhere . <p> Does anybody knows what is the accuracy of the tag ? Not for the altitude but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a centimeter scale , or meter scale ? I can not find any concrete figure about this on igotU website . <p> I am unable to reset the sampling time of my 600 to f.e. 15 seconds , the shift to do so does not work . I can set to a bit more than a minute by using the second lower shift but not the upper shift . Any idea to solve this ? Han <p> Does anybody knows what is the accuracy of the tag ?

@@119850968 @8850968/ <p> The surface area to volume ratio in living organisms is very important . Nutrients and oxygen need to diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cells . Most cells are no longer than 1mm in diameter because small cells enable nutrients and oxygen to diffuse into the cell quickly and allow waste to diffuse out of the cell quickly . If the cells were any bigger than this then it would take too long for the nutrients and oxygen to diffuse into the cell so the cell would probably not survive . <p> Single celled organisms can survive as they have a large enough surface area to allow all the oxygen and nutrients they need to diffuse through . Larger multi celled organisms need specialist organs to respire such as lungs or gills . <p> Cresol red dye is an acid / alkali indicator dye . In the alkali conditions of the gelatin it is red or purple but when it gets exposed to acid it turns a light yellow colour . <p> Gelatin is used for these tests as it is permeable and so it acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required sizes and the hydrochloric acid can diffuse at an even rate through it . <p> I am not using any blocks bigger than 20 x 20 x 20 as a preliminary test found that it was only practical to use blocks of 20mm or less as anything bigger than this would take longer than the amount of time that we have to do the experiment . <p> 2 . A small beaker was filled with 100cm of 0.1 molar Hydrochloric acid . This is a sufficient volume of acid to ensure that all the block sizes are fully covered in acid when dropped into the beaker . <p> 3 . One of the blocks is dropped into this beaker and the time for all the red dye to disappear is noted in a table such as the one below . <p> Dimensions ( mm ) <p> Surface Area <p> Volume ( mm ) <p> Surface Area / Volume Ratio <p> Test 1 <p> Test 2 <p> Test 3 <p> Average Time <p> 4 . This test should be repeated for all the sizes of blocks three times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each block to ensure that this does not affect the experiment ? s results . <p> 5 . The surface area / volume ratio and an average of the results can then be worked out . A graph of Time against Surface Area to Volume Ratio can then be plotted . From this graph we will be able to see how the surface area affects the time taken for the hydrochloric acid to penetrate to the centre of the cube . <p> I predict that as the Surface Area / Volume Ratio increases the time taken for the hydrochloric acid to penetrate to the centre of the cube will go down . This is because a small block has a large amount of surface area compared to it ? s volume so the hydrochloric acid will have a large surface area to diffuse through . A larger block has a smaller amount of surface area in relation to it ? s size so it should take longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse into the centre of the cube . The actual rate of the hydrochloric acid diffusing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when the surface area / volume ratio goes up it will take less time for the hydrochloric acid to reach the centre of the cube . <p> In all the blocks of gelatin the rate of penetration of the hydrochloric acid from each side would have been the same but all the blocks take different amounts of time to clear because they are different sizes . As the blocks get bigger it takes longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse through all the block and so clear the dye . It takes longer to reach the centre of the cube even though the rate of diffusion is the same for all the cubes . <p> As the volume of the blocks goes up the Surface Area / Volume ratio goes down . The larger blocks have a smaller proportion of surface area than the smaller blocks . The smallest block has 1.4mm of surface area for every 1mm of volume . The largest block only has 0.3mm of surface area for each 1mm of volume . This means that the hydrochloric acid is able to diffuse to the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The acid took 48 minutes to diffuse to the centre of the largest block but only 1 minute in the smallest block . A living cell would not survive if it had to wait 48 minutes for oxygen to diffuse through it so living cells need to be very small . <p> When the surface area to volume ratio goes down it takes longer for the hydrochloric acid to diffuse into the cube but if the ratio goes up then the hydrochloric acid diffuses more quickly into the block of gelatin . Some shapes have a larger surface area to volume ratio so the shape of the object can have an effect on the rate of diffusion . <p> It is important that cells have a large surface area to volume ratio so that they can get enough nutrients into the cell . They can increase their surface area by flattening and becoming longer or by having a rough surface with lots of folds of cell membrane known as villi. picture not reproduced <p> The villi vastly increase the surface area of the cell whereas the cell which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? s volume . Both cells above have an volume of 1cm . The cell on the left has a surface area of 3cm but the cell on the right with villi has a surface area of 10cm . The cell membrane is made up of a lipid bi-layer with many proteins integrated into it . picture not reproduced <p> Oxygen can diffuse easily through the membrane and Carbon Dioxide and other waste products can easily dissolve out . The concentration of oxygen in the cell is always lower than outside the cell which causes the oxygen to diffuse in . Gases will always dissolve from an area of high to low pressure . The concentration of carbon dioxide outside the cell is lower than the concentration in the cell so the carbon dioxide will always dissolve out of the cell . <p> Single celled organisms such as amoebas have a large surface area to volume ratio because they are so small . They are able to get all the oxygen and nutrients they need by diffusion through the cell membrane . <p> Larger organisms such as mammals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need special systems such as the lungs in order to get enough oxygen . Surface area to volume ratio is very important in lungs where a large amount of oxygen has to get into the lungs . The lungs have a very large surface area because they contain millions of sacs called alveoli which allow oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream . By having millions of these alveoli the lungs are able to cram a very large surface area into a small space . This surface area is sufficient for all the oxygen we need to diffuse through it and to let the carbon dioxide out . <p> To help make this experiment more accurate , I repeated it three times for each block size and then used the average of all the results to plot a graph with a line of best fit . I tried to keep all the variables except for the size of the gelatin blocks the same for all the experiments . However , in reality it is impossible to keep all the variables precisely the same . For example : <p> a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gelatin block each time . I measured the sizes to the nearest mm so the sizes of block that I used should be correct to the nearest mm . <p> b ) When the gelatin blocks are dropped into the beakers the base of the block comes into contact with the bottom of the beaker which reduces the surface area of the block that comes into contact with the hydrochloric acid . <p> c ) The results will be slightly inaccurate as the moment when the gelatin block has lost all it ? s dye is a matter of opinion and not something that can be measured precisely . <p> d ) Due to the fairly slow speed of our reactions it is only possible to measure the time of the reaction to the nearest 0.1 second even though the stopwatch shows the measurements to the nearest 0.01 second . <p> The graph produced shows a smooth curve with a decreasing gradient as the surface area to volume ratio goes up . The only anomaly is the result for the 5 x 5 x 5 block . The result here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph . The results for the 5 x 5 x 5 block ranged from 4.53 to 7.02 seconds with an average of 6.15 seconds . The line of best fit for the graph suggests that the average should be around 3 seconds . The anomalous result was probably due to experimental error as a result of this being the first block size that I used in the experiment . The most likely explanation is that I was unsure of how to judge when all the dye had disappeared and as a result delayed pressing the stop button of the stop watch . As the experiment progressed with the other block sizes I probably got better at making this judgement . <p> 1 ) It could be repeated more times to help get rid of any anomalies . A better overall result would be obtained by repeating the experiment more times because any errors in one experiment should be compensated for by the other experiments . <p> 2 ) Using more shapes and sizes of gelatin block would have produced a better looking graph . <p> 3 ) Variables that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of diffusion may also be affected by temperature , strength of acid and volume of acid <p> 4 ) The block could be suspended in the hydrochloric acid so than none of it ? s surfaces are in contact with the wall of the beaker . A small cradle could be used to suspend the blocks in the acid which would mean that all six sides of the cube should be in contact with the acid .

@@119850973 @8850973/ <p> The Sun provides the energy to turn the water in the plants into a vapour causing it to evaporate into the leave ? s internal air spaces before diffusing out of the stomata into the air . This is known as transpiration . As the water evaporates out of the top of the plant it creates a suction on the column of water below it in the xylem . The upwards force on the column of water created by transpiration and the downwards force due to gravity created a tension in the column of water . <p> As the upwards pull is greater than the downwards pull the column of water moves up the xylem . Cohesion tension theory tells us that it is the evaporation of water from the leaves which causes the upwards movement of water . The water molecules have a high cohesion as they are polar and so are electrically attracted to each other . They are held together by hydrogen bonds . The column of water does not tend to break as it has a very high tensile strength from the bonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf as the leaf has a high water potential and the air has a low water potential so the water molecules pass down the concentration gradient from the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells into the leave ? s internal air spaces before diffusing out into the air . <p> Transpiration is needed to keep the cells of the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells moist as this allows carbon dioxide to dissolve before diffusing into the cells for photosynthesis . The stomata open in the day to let carbon dioxide diffuse in , and to let oxygen diffuse out as part of photosynthesis . At night photosynthesis is unable to take place due to the absence of light so the stomata are closed to reduce water loss . <p> Light causes potassium ions to be pumped into the guard cells which lowers their water potential and so water diffuses into the guard cells causing them to go turgid and so open . At night potassium moves out of the guard cells into the surrounding cells so the water diffuses out of the guard cells causing them to close . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water uptake from the roots which causes the plants to suffer from water stress . To combat this ABA is produced by the plant which causes the rapid pumping of potassium ions out of the guard cells which closes them and so reduces the water loss by transpiration . <p> For this experiment a simple potometer will be made to measure the rate of water uptake from the plant . The potometer is the easiest way of measuring this and is quite accurate as well . The experiment is limited by the fact that the potometer measures the total water uptake and not just the transpiration rate . <p> I am planning to use the following method for my experiment . <p> 1 . A privet shoot is cut under water in a large bowl about 1 inch up the stem . This should remove any blockages that are within the xylem when the shoot was originally cut . In order to stop the xylem vessels from being crushed when the shoot is cut , it should be cut diagonally with a razor blade . The end of the privet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was cut in order to prevent any air bubbles getting into the system . <p> 2 . The capillary tube should be completely filled with water by submerging it into the same bowl as the privet shoot . <p> 3 . The capillary tube should be attached to the shoot underwater being careful to make sure that there are no air bubbles in the tube . <p> 4 . The joins between the capillary tube and the shoot should be sealed with Vaseline to make sure that the system is water tight . <p> 5 . Making sure that the open end of the capillary tube remains underwater the plant can be raised out of the water and clamped above the bowl of water in an upright position . <p> 6 . The whole system should now be full of water and completely air tight . As the plant transpires it will pull water up through the tubing . This apparatus will measure the total water uptake . <p> 7 . Allow the apparatus to equilibrate for about 5 minutes . As this is the control experiment the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a bench lamp . There should also be no wind in the area that the experiment is taking place . <p> 8 . Introduce an air bubble to the system by holding the apparatus out of the water until a bubble forms . <p> 9 . Measure how far the bubble has risen up the capillary tube every thirty seconds for five minutes . When measuring the distances your eye should be at a 90 angle from the bottom of the bubble . This way parallax error can be avoided when looking at the scale on the ruler . You also must measure from the same point of bubble every time in order to ensure consistency in the measurement taking . I am planning to take all my measurements from the bottom of the bubble . The distances travelled should be noted . <p> Diagram Of The Potometer not reproduced <p> The test should be repeated 5 or 6 more times so that an accurate average of the rate of water uptake can be obtained . After each experiment the tubing can be refilled with water by placing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air bubble out of the tube . <p> 10 . The air temperature of the room should also be noted . This test will give the rate of transpiration under normal inside conditions . These set of results are a control set of results against which the other results can be compared . <p> It is very important that the whole apparatus is air tight as if any bubbles of air were to get into the xylem then transpiration would not occur . This is because any air bubble would break the continuous column of water which is usually present in the xylem and so the water molecules below the air bubble would not feel the upwards pull from the above water molecules . The xylem would soon fill with air in a process called cavitation . The plant is cut under water an inch up it ? s stem in order to get rid of the bottom part of the xylem which may have an air bubble in it . Doing this makes sure that the shoot which will be used in the experiment has water in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated but this time changing the following environmental conditions . <h> Wind <p> To measure how wind affects transpiration a hairdryer or fan that blows cold air can be used to blow the leaves . The fan has to be fairly close to the leaves but not so close that it will buffet the leaves as this may cause the stomata to close . <h> Humidity <p> The shoot will be enclosed in a transparent plastic bag . The humidity will soon increase as the water vapour which has been transpired will not be able to leave the bag and so will stay around the plant thereby increasing the humidity . <h> Light <p> The windows will be covered and the lights dimmed to make the conditions darker . <h> Surface Area <p> The surface area of the leaves of the plant can be reduced by vasolining the leaves on the top and especially to the bottom side of the leaf . The bottom side of the leaf is where the stomata are so this is where most of the water loss in the plant occurs . Applying Vaseline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so water vapour will be unable to leave the leaf through this leaf . The effect that this has on the rate of transpiration can be measured . The surface area of the leaf that has just been vaselined can be measured by drawing around the leaf on some graph paper . The surface area can be worked out by counting the squares . This vaselining technique can be used on more and more leaves till all the plant ? s leaves are vaselined . <p> Each experiment should be replicated several times in order to obtain more accurate data and to get rid of any anomalies that may occur in a single experiment . I will note the results in a table for each 30 second period in all the experiments . <p> From these recorded distances I will work out the rate of water uptake for each 30 second period for all the experiments . Using these rates I plan to plot several graphs of the rate of water uptake against the time for various environmental conditions . I shall plot the results for the same environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these environmental factors has on the rate can easily be compared . <p> I shall also work out the volume of water taken up per minute . This can be worked out with the following equation . <p> I predict that if the wind is increased the rate of transpiration will increase . In the control test where there will be no wind a band a water vapour will be able to form in the air spaces of the leaf and around it as water transpires out . This will reduce the water potential gradient between inside the leaf and the air so the rate of transpiration will be reduced . If air is blown across the leaves by the wind or in the case of this experiment a hairdryer , this band of water vapour will be blown away and further water vapour will not be able to accumulate . This will lead to an increase in the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the air and so the rate at which water transpires into the air will increase . <p> I predict that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for transpiration is halved then the rate of transpiration will be halved . This is because the plant loses almost all it ? s water through it ? s leaves so if it loses the ability to transpire through half of it ? s leaves then the plant will only lose half as much water through transpiration . The amount of surface area that the plant has should be directly proportional to the rate of transpiration . <p> Secondary results that were taken in January 1998 under controlled conditions were provided . The environmental conditions were measured with electronic probes . These results showed the distance that the air bubble had travelled up the capillary tube over a period of 4 minutes . <p> Using these results I worked out the rate of travel up the capillary tube for all the experiments . I also averaged the duplicated experiments to give me an average set of results for experiments 14 and 15 , and also an average of experiments 11 and 12 . I averaged experiments 1 , 2 and 9 to produce control data for the rate of travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared . <p> The sheet of secondary results is shown on the next page . The results table with my extra calculations for the rates of uptake and the averages of the duplicated experiments are shown on the page after that . not reproduced <p> Graphs of the rate of uptake against time were drawn by me for the surface area of the leaves and the wind speed . <p> I will analyse the results for the surface area experiments and the wind speed experiments . <h> Surface Area <p> The graph shows that as the surface area goes down , the rate of transpiration goes down . This would seem to prove my prediction . When the surface area of the plant ? s leaves available for transpiration is reduced , the rate of transpiration is also reduced . When the surface area of the leaves is reduced from 5058mm to 2773mm ( which is a decrease of 46% ) , the rate of transpiration decreases 50% which would seem to suggest a directly proportional relationship between the surface area and the rate of transpiration . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2773mm to 659mm ) the rate of water uptake only reduces by 33% . This would suggest that perhaps the rate of transpiration is reducing at a directly proportional rate but that the rest of the water is being used for photosynthesis . When the plant had a large surface area only a small percentage of water was lost due to photosynthesis . When the plant ? s surface area for transpiration was reduced the effect of photosynthesis on the water loss was a lot more noticeable . <p> Photosynthesis was able to continue because the leaves were still on the plant and receiving light , they must have had enough carbon dioxide left in the photosynthesising cells for photosynthesis to continue after the stomata had been blocked by the vasoline . If the plant had been left for a longer period of time then the carbon dioxide levels in the photosynthesising cells would have dropped and so the rate of photosynthesis would also have reduced . <p> The main anomaly with this graph is that it shows the control results , ( surface area of 5997mm ) with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant had a leaf surface area of 5058mm . <p> By looking at the provided raw data sheet it can be seen that the first two control experiments with a surface area of 5997mm ( 1 and 2 ) would give an average rate of 0.9cm/minute which would make the rate higher than the experiment where the surface area was 5058mm . However it is the third control experiment ( number 9 ) which drags the average rate down to below that of the experiment with less surface area . I believe the reason the rate for control experiment 9 being significantly lower than experiment 1 and 2 is due to experiment 9 being done straight after experiment 8 where the light level was reduced to 21% . This reduced light level will have slowed down the rate of transpiration to the extent that it had not had time to recover when experiment 9 ( the third control experiment ) was started . The reduced light level would have caused the stomata to close which would have resulted in less water being able to transpire out of the stomata . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 2 . <h> Wind <p> Wind moving past the leaves caused a large increase in the rate of water uptake . When there was no wind in the control experiments the average rate of water uptake was 0.85cm/minute . When the wind was added at 0.98m/s , the transpiration rate increased to1.1cm/minute , ( an increase of 23% ) . <p> As I predicted , increasing the wind increases the water uptake rate . Increasing the wind speed to 1.1m/second further increased the transpiration rate to 1.13cm/second . The rate was much slower in the control test because in the absence of wind , a band of water vapour was able to form in the internal air spaces of the leaf and around the leaf as the water vapour transpired out . This reduced the water potential gradient between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells inside the leaf and the air so the rate of transpiration was reduced . When air was blown across the leaves by the hairdryer , this band of water vapour was blown away and further water vapour was not be able to accumulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradient between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells inside the leaf and the air and so the rate of transpiration into the air increased . <p> a ) The experiment measures the total water uptake which includes water used by the plant as well as the water lost through transpiration . Though most of the water ( 90 - 99% ) is lost through transpiration , a small amount is used by the plant for photosynthesis and so this experiment is not able to tell us the exact rate of transpiration . <p> b ) It is often difficult to change just one environmental condition without changing another . For example the lamps used to give the leaves the maximum possible light intensity in the experiment will also have the effect of slightly heating up the leaves . This could cause the rate of transpiration to go up . <p> c ) These experiments were carried out one after another without leaving enough time for the plant to equilibrate after each experiment . For example , after the light intensity had been reduced to 21% in experiment 8 , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate to rise to it ? s normal level . Therefore , experiment 9 which was a control experiment produced a significantly lower average rate than the control experiments 1 and 2 . <p> d ) There was a general deterioration in the results as the experiments went on . As the experiments were carried out the water would have warmed up to room temperature . This will have caused bubbles to form in the xylem as the air started to dissolve out of it . These air bubbles could have caused a loss of cohesion tension in the leaves , which may have lead to cavitation in the xylem . This cavitation would have reduced the number of working xylem in the stem and could account for the reduced rated of uptake in later experiments . <p> 1 ) It could be repeated more times to help get rid of any anomalies . A better overall result would be obtained by repeating the experiment more times because any errors in one experiment should be compensated for by the other experiments . <p> 2 ) More time should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the next experiment was started . This would have reduced the number of anomalies caused by the sudden exposure of the plant to completely different conditions when the previous effects of the last experiment ? s conditions had not had time to wear off . <p> 3 ) The water used in the bowl could have been allowed to warm up to room temperature before the experiment began . This would have stopped the air in the water from dissolving out and leading to cavitation in the xylem vessels . <p> 4 ) A different method of carrying out the experiment could have been devised that would measure the rate of transpiration instead of the total water uptake . <h> Disclaimer <p> This is a real A-level school project and as such is intended for educational or research purposes only .

By take home money ' I mean the salary plus dividend remaining after all taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left for you to spend . <p> The lines stop at the point where the maximum amount of money has been extracted from the company . <p> Here is a simplified version just showing a turnover of -60,000 . Note that the y-axis starts at -30,000 . <p> You can see that your extracted money goes up at first as your salary increases because you are making use of your personal allowance . Then it hits a very obvious peak after which income tax and national insurance kick in . <p> The maximum amount of money extracted is reached by paying salary at the national insurance secondary threshold level which is -144/week or -624 per month giving an annual salary of -7488 . <p> In the above graph you can see that someone can take nearly -47,000 net out of the company .

You might spot that the Take home money and the Total Tax are perfect mirror images of each other , and the two together add up to the turnover . <p> The dividend is the declared dividend paid to you which does n't  include the 10% tax credit .

You can see that if you increased your salary from the secondary threshold level of -7488 to -15,000 you and your company would be paying an extra -1500+ of tax . <p> The final graph shows the income tax and national insurance . <p> I hope this is all correct if you spot any mistakes do let me know and I 'll fix them .

Not entirely sure what it was for , and if I 'd been in an English speaking country I might not have bothered , but here I thought it was best to get all the insurance I could get . <p> He also gave me a brochure which had some reasonable road maps of Naha in it , and a 1000 petrol voucher which could be used at certain petrol stations . <p> I was told I had to fill the tank just before I finished with the car ( Japanese for full tank is mantan ' ) . This car needed regular ' petrol . <p> And I re-confirmed that I would be leaving it in the hotels car park overnight for them to collect in the morning . <h> Driving in Naha <p> The car was an automatic and it took a little while to get used to . If you are used to a manual then the main difference is that you do n't need to worry about the clutch . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is move it from park ' to drive ' to get going .

Normally you 'd have to pay depending on the distance traveled , but as they were letting everyone use the express way for free there was nothing to pay . <h> Petrol stations <p> You will probably have to visit a petrol station at some point .

The lock ' will then lower and you can drive your car away . You may only have a limited time to do this so do n't wait too long ! Do check the prices before parking some can be very expensive . They often have different prices for peak and off-peak hours . <p> The second type is the barrier car park where you collect a ticket on the way in . On the way out you put the ticket in a machine and it tells you how much to pay . When you pay the barrier will open . <p> The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited space . You will see tall windowless metal towers dotted about . There are the roulette car parks . You drive you car in through the door and when you leave the car will be rotated inside so that another space becomes free . <p> To get the car back there may be an attendant , or there may be a fully automated paying machine . You will then need to reverse your car onto the circular turning table which will spin your car around so you can drive straight out onto the road . <h> Returning the car <p> At the end of my Naha driving day I parked in the hotel car park . It was one of those car parking spaces where once you 've parked the car a barrier rises between the front and back wheels . <p> As I was n't going to be around when the rental company man collected the car I left the keys at the hotel reception , and I also paid the overnight parking charge in advance .

Buy a proper pump from a bike shop . <p> Here is the 100 yen bike pump attached to the wheel . Both the bike pumps I got from the 100 yen shop sprung leaks after a few minutes of use . And the plastic of the red one cracked after attempting to blow up the tyre . It is technically possible to inflate a tyre with one of these pumps " I just would n't recommend it ! <p> This is what happened to that cheap bike pump after attempting to inflate the tyre for about 10 minutes . <p> I came to my senses and bought a better bike pump . This time costing me 2940 from a sports shop in a local Youme Town shopping centre . The photo on the left shows the pump and the clip . The one on the right shows how the clip for the English/Dunlop/Woods value attaches to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for attaching a pump . Instead of screwing onto the valve , the clip squeezes the pump onto the valve . It works though . You get an airtight connection as long as you do n't  alter the angle of the pump too much . <p> And using one of these you 'll find the tyre much , much easier to inflate . Ive estimate that you 'll be able to inflate the tyre 20-30 times faster than with the 100 yen pump . 213587 @qwx1073587 <h> One Response to " Puncture repair in Japan " <p> thankyou very much for the information . i recently bought a bridgestone sprinter bicycle which is of course is japanese but very well made , maybe 20 years old now . there is the old english valves on the wheels and recently i had a puncture and so here i am researching but very happy now that i know the name of the valves . i remember as a child these valves on our bicycles in england . i live in thailand now . today i will fix my puncture and put new rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this site is great . thanks again . tom van gat 
@@119850988 @8850988/ <h> Related <p> A few weeks before leaving the country for a three month holiday I got a letter telling me I 'd get a new debit card soon . Obviously I did n't want it to be delivered in my absence so I went to the branch and told them that I did n't want a new card to be sent out , and that I would re-order a card when I was back . The staff member did some typing away on the computer . I was assured by the staff member that no card would be delivered whilst I was away . <p> On returning from holiday I found that a new debit card had been delivered . I tried it and found that the card did n't work . They had posted me the card and it was cancelled by the time I got home . <p> I went to the branch and waited patiently in branch for 20 minutes without being acknowledged or being told there would be a wait , whilst the customer service guy dealt with another customer . <p> When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be re-activated .

Inside was a NatWest debit card . I 'd asked for it to be delivered to the branch , but here was a debit card arriving at my door . <p> I phoned the card activation line and they activated my card . <p> I went to the cash machine , put my card in , and typed in the PIN number . I got a message saying the card had not been activated and was now cancelled . <p> How can this be " I just activated it ! <p> I phoned their customer care line and told them what had happened .

She could , but it was not the latest card ! <p> After a bit of talking we figured out what had happened . The guy in my local branch had in fact ordered two cards for me at the same time . The first had gone to my home address , and the second was going to be sent to the branch . <p> When I called up the card activation line the lady activated the latest card ( the one going to the branch , which I had not yet received ) . This was a reasonable thing for her to do as she would n't expect there to have been two cards ordered for me . So the card which arrived at my home had not been activated which is why it got cancelled when I put it in the machine . <p> I said I was worried as their security system of activating the card when it arrives in the customers hand had not worked . Because of the mistake made by the bank employee my card was now active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would investigate and someone would call me back in the week . I gave her my mobile number as I was going to be out at work all week . <p> A few days later when I got home I saw a message on my home answering machine . It was someone from NatWest . Despite me telling her to phone me on my mobile she had called me back on my home phone . The message from the lady said that she would call me back tomorrow and she left a reference number . <p> I called the number and had to wait about 10 minutes to get through . I gave my reference number . The man who answered it gave me what information he could . He said he would add a note to the file telling the lady to call me back on my mobile . <p> The next day I arrived home and found another message on my answering machine .

@@119850997 @8850997/ <p> I have spent a lot of time in the past few weeks helping a friend whose flat is under attack by clothes moths . The species in question is known as the common clothes moth , the webbing clothes moth , or if you are really posh , as tineola bisselliella . <p> There have been clothes moths in this property for many years eating the carpets but it is only recently that damage to clothes was spotted . This initiated a massive operation in order to protect the remaining clothes and get rid of the moths . Here are some photos of the chewed up carpets and clothes . The carpets here are wool and they really like them ! <p> If you do n't  know what a clothe moth look like here are some images . They are only about a centimetre long but are very destructive . They lay their eggs on cotton or wool clothes and carpets . The clothes moths themselves do not eat the clothes . It is what hatches from the eggs that causes the damage . <p> The larvae are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a brown / red head . When they hatch they start eating your clothes / carpet . Later they turn into moths . <p> The clothes moths and larvae like dark undisturbed places such as under your bed , desk or in your wardrobe . When I closely inspected the carpets I spotted hundreds of eggs along the edges of the carpet under a desk . The eggs are tiny much smaller than a pinhead . <p> When I lifted the carpet there were thousands more along under the skirting board . I tried to vacuum the eggs up but this required a lot of scraping with the hoover as the eggs were well stuck on . Even after a lot of vacuuming I still could n't remove all the visible eggs . <p> I tried getting rid of the eggs , moths and larvae by using moth sprays from Robert Dyas . They do kill the moths and larvae but not the eggs . You can kill all the moths and larvae but then the next day there will be a whole load of fresh larvae to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took them all to a laundrette in black bags . They were then hot-washed them to remove any eggs , the black bags were thrown away ( in case they contained any moth eggs ) and then the clean clothes were put in new black bags . I then took the clothes to my ( non-moth infested ) flat to keep them safe until the problem is sorted . <p> When it became clear that the home sprays werent able to get rid of them completely , the landlord was contacted who arranged for a professional to come into the flat . When the pest control guy visited he explained that the eggs are virtually indestructible . He said he would spray the carpet with a chemical that would kill any live clothes moths or larvae . The chemical would remain on the carpet for two weeks ( no vacuuming in the mean time ) killing any larvae which subsequently hatch . After two weeks the carpets would be sprayed again . He was very confident that this would get rid of the problem . Well have to wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moth problems right away before they cause real damage . <p> Household moth killers may work against small numbers of moths but are unlikely to help if you have an established infestation . <p> If you have clothes moths then consider replacing and wool carpets with synthetic ones . <p> You can use lavender scented moth repellers in wardrobes to keep the moths away . However they are not fully effective some moths do n't  seem bothered about the scent ! <p> Vacuum regularly to increase the chances of removing eggs . However even vacuuming wont get rid of all of them as the eggs are usually stuck to the carpet fibres . <p> Try to avoid having dark undisturbed areas in your rooms . e.g. if you have lots of junk under your bed try to move it elsewhere or get rid of it . This will reduce the number of hiding spaces for them . <p> If the infestation is established then you may have to get a professional in . This could cost many hundreds of pounds .

I have found out that the chemical is called Ficam W. After each spraying moths started re-appearing after 5-6 days . There will be a third spraying in a few days and maybe even a fourth ! <p> Moth Update 11th August 2008 <p> The first two spraying failed to get rid of the moths so my friend decided to move out . I gather from the remaining flat mates that the moths are still there and the landlord did n't  bother to get a third spraying even though it would n't have cost him any more ! <p> Unfortunately the problem is not over .

Any advice would be greatly appreciated . <p> Have just gone on line and found this website . How depressing , I have joined the crowd with the problem of moths in my carpet . I do n't  yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively start checking . Does anyone know if changing the fitted wool carpet to synthetic does the trick ? I cant move out of the flat as I own it ! <p> Fingers crossed- myself and my boyfriend have found the source we think . <p> We have one of those beds that has storage under the matress , we found what looks like patches of eggs . We 've vacumed the whole area , added Rentokil paper which according to the packaging kills moths , larvae and eggs . its a rather dusty flat but now we shall be keeping it spic and span at all times . We have been useing Mottlock natural traps for the last 6 months- which do seem to attract the males from the spirit of nature website . <p> As from the above comments we are yet to see an improvement but will keep you updated . We are just off to the laundrette to boil everything . He s very upset as they have eaten through an antique blanket . We are getting rather good a swatting though ! <p> I also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three jumpers ruined with holes . A fairly expensive cashmere jumper was the worst hit and today I see a hole in my boxer shorts ! <p> This is clearly going to be a nightmare to get rid off despite hoovering ( wooden floor ) and having a search about for the larvae . I have only seen a couple of moths flying about which have been squatted . I 've put out the balls that you get from the dry cleaners.I do hope they bugger off though I cant afford to replace all my clothes ! <p> We 've got the case bearing type , first noticed about 7 years ago . The larvae are relatively easy to spot , as long as they are on the surface , as they look like grains of rice . <p> They do n't  seem to be muching on clothes or even my cashmere overcoat but then they probably came with the wool carpet we bought 10 years ago ; they find that delicious . <p> We tried the phermone traps but that just confirmed we had a continuing infestation . Theyll even grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made fibres . <p> I do n't  think well ever get rid of the problem as long as we have the carpets but have brought it under control by being thorough in doing a full dig them out and hoover , including lifting edges , which they love . This is to make sure they never get to be adults . The fewer adults there are the fewer new eggs get laid . A monthly spring clean would stop them completely but I only do this quarterly and means moving out all furniture from the edges and getting down with torch and pointed tweezers to dig away at the fibres . At tleast the holes are only under furniture such as our beds . <p> The reason I think well never get rid of the moths is that there must be millions of eggs dormant within the pile waiting for their turn and you cant kill the eggs except by soaking with chemicals that would be harmful to humans . <p> I 've just found this website when researching how to get rid of moths We have no carpets in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good look at the carpets soon to see if they 're the source of our problems ! We 've bought a sticky Moth catcher that they attract to then they stick to it for every room , and got ceder wood for the cloths cupboards You say your friend actually MOVED OUT of his flat because of moths ? ! Are we going to have to do that too ? We cant afford a professonal at the moment and your professonal did n't  even do the job right <p> Hopefully you 'll be able to get rid of them yourselves . My friends infestation was so bad that even the professional couldnt get rid of the moths after two visits . The carpets needed to be replaced and the landlord just was n't willing to do this . In the end there was no choice but to move out as the place was too horrible to stay in largely due to the moths . <p> Sounds like you are taking some of the correct steps . Make sure you are vacuuming regularly as well and try to find out where the eggs are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating them ! <p> Sorry to hear about your infestation they are n't  easy to get rid of : ( <p> My friend actually managed to get compensation from the landlord for the damage that had been done to her clothes and for the stress that had been caused . He gave her a months rent in compensation . It was n't easy to get it though she had to tell the landlord that shed complained to the University housing office he was one of their registered landlords which meant that he had signed up to a code of conduct . One of the rules is of course that the flats should be free from infestations . <p> I have no idea what help you can seek in France ( I 'm assuming you are in France ) but I would hope that every landlord would have a duty to keep your home free from infestations ! Check to see if it is mentioned in your contract . You are then going to have to do more research to see what options you have in your country . <p> I 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothsWe have a moths infestation for 8 months now . We had already a professional treatment 3 times , all the cloths washed and sent to the dry cleaner twice . The carpet is eaten everywhere ( we 've got 95% of carpet in the house ) and my children are still playing on an infested carpet . now my landlord is telling me that it is my responsibility and I should pay for the carpet . <p> ADMIN could you please tell me what happen when your friend moved , did he has to pay for the damages caused by the moths ? If you have any advice , that would be great , I am French and I do n't  know what to do , where to ask for help . <p> For several weeks now I have been plagued by unseen " MONSTERS " that left large patches on my carpets , curtains , bedding , wallpaper , clothes and even my poor dogs fur . I have been on the brink of a nervous breakdown trying to find the source as well as clean everything in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin bags to store everything I had washed and with 4 small children there is an awful lot to wash , dry and store . I contacted my housing officer who inspected my house and told me it was all in my head and that I should consider visiting my doctor for stress . I then contacted enviromental health and explained that I could hear " snap crackle &amp; pop " type sounds coming from the bags I had stored the clean items in and told them about the carpets and furnishings that seems to be decaying and they sent round an inspecter . By the time they came I had collected what looked like flakes of paint or paper along with cotton looking pods and what I thought was chipboard flakes . I had been searching the internet to identify what I had found and the symptoms of my home and so many things were similar that it really made me paranoid and in my head I had everything from parasitic free living worms to stachybotrys " dry mould spores " infesting my home and worrying it would cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything and after finding these " chipboard flakes " in my food cupboards I had no choice but to throw away every item of food and refused to bring any food into the house until the problem was resolved , so I have been paying for meals . I have wrecked my home by taking up carpets and skirting boards and removing wallpaper so that the enviromental health officer could see the damage caused because even my kitchen is infested , under cupboards and along skirting boards and walls . <p> When the officer came round she looked at the damage and said the decay was natural and it is an old house so I should expect some decay . she also said the stuff around the skirting boards was dust and grease . she told me I needed to calm down and start using my kitchen again and not to go looking for things that were not there and that I should pay more attention to cleaning ! ! I have always been a clean and tidy person , bourdering OCD so I was mortified to hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . The house was fumigated and all that was found after was more chipboard flakes lol . <p> After finding this site yesterday " many weeks after a constant battle " I went looking for evidence of moths and BINGO I found everything I needed to identify the cause . The chipbooard flakes were actually wings . The carpet damage , and the " dry mould " is actually droppings from the moths . The whole house was wallpapered by L&amp;Q using some kind of embosted paper that the moths obviously love so everything is half ruined . I have lost thousands of pounds already with damage and infestation and for so called experts to not identify this problem , I am totally disgusted ! L&amp;Q have classes clothes moths as " PESTS " therefor I am responsible for all internal infestation and repair . I feel like setting light to the house and walking away . Its amazing what tiny little creatures can do to your life . Now I have to deal with this problem and try and rebuild my home as well as my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the info in here , you really have taken the world off my shoulders <p> OMG- I can not believe the above Im compleately freaked out 4 weeks ago I discovered a top ( wool ) with 12 tiny holes i cleaned my wardrobe and found one dead moth . I trawled the internet somehow missed this thread and saw pictures of the moths I cleaned every press / drawer in my room and threw out loads . While i cleaned my room i put all the clothes in the bathroom and those that i washed in a black bag and brought to the kitchen where i emptied them onto the floor for washing No other clothes appeared damaged 2 days later i found one moth in the kitchen last week i found another i have been finding moths since in my bedroom and in the bathroom and hall they ( so far ) are in no other room I found 3 under my bed and a dead one in between the base and matress.I have a carpet in my room and am so worried now like Joanne I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . I do n't  know how bad the problem is or have i an infestation . I have found maybe 20 approx over the last 4 weeks On the ceiling / around the doors / inside curtains / in the evening ( dusk ) . I never really open my window in my room except for recentlywhen the weather has been warm I work away from Limerick and so am only at home at weekends which gives them loads of time without being disturbed . I do n't  know what to do or how bad it is and do not know how they got in in the first place . I have hung lavender bags in the wardrobes and hot press I have the sheet things and I alos bought a trap thing which i have left at the end of my bed . I alos got a spray I will see next weekend how effective the products are . Can anyone help PLEASE ! <p> O and also when I went to the chemist to buy the moth killers etc the lady sadi that I was the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know if they were clothes moths but that there seems to be an infestation of them at the moment and suggested that it is maybe due to the warm weather . i do n't  know I just want them gone . <p> I 'm battling them too ! Last year I was sent down to London for 6 months with work and when I returned to my flat in Leeds I kep seeing a few moths in different rooms . After a couple of weeks of swatting them I realised there must be a bit of a problem and looked on the internet and realised it was more than likely the common clothes moth . I did a full search of the flat and found the main infestation was under a heavy wardrobe in the main spare room which is never moved the moths had munched about 2 foot of wool carpet under the wardrobe ! I found larvae here too , but nowhere else . <p> I bought some spray off the internet and religiously vacuumed every room including in all nooks and crannies and moved all furniture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did this a couple of times over 2 weeks or so . Whilst not as many as before , after a week or so I 'd still keep finding one or two live moths here or there in different rooms . After trying again for a couple more weeks I figured I needed the pros in , so called Rentokil . <p> Theyve charged me -207 for 3 full sprays , although importantly I did make them amend their booking form so that it said " 3 full sprays or more as required " . They spray the whole floor area in each room , rather than just at the edges near the skirting board as obviously if a moth lays any eggs not at the edges , the infestation will start over again . After the first 2 sprays ( 8 days apart ) I again began to see a couple of moths ( but literally only about 3 over the period ) here and there . I had the third full spray last Friday ( 26th June 2009 ) and the chap absolutely soaked the place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel is I 'll need more than one more treatment . At least now however they do seem to only be re-appearing in the main spare room where theyd munched that carpet . My worry is that theyve somehow laid tons of eggs under the carpet which will continue to slowly hatch etc . Apparently the eggs are pretty hardy . <p> Rich What was the name of the spray that you bought on the internet ? I have n't seen any eggs or damage to the carpet yet but I am going to buy a magnifying glass and torch and check all the carpets this weekend . This is a nightmare . <p> It was " Pro-Active C for Moths " from Pest Control Direct , but as I say , I spent over -100 on that stuff before I got Rentokil in and really the whole floor surface area needs spraying and not just the edges/skirting , so I 'm very dubious of it . I 'm beginning to think that where the main infestation was I 'm going to have to pull the carpet up and get Rentokil to spray both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet that you need to spray 2 feet from the edges on both the top of the carpet and underneath it to make sure you zap it all . Its SO annoying ! <p> You really should have a good look in your house . If you 've found 20 in the last 4 weeks , then to be honest , that 's more than I 'm finding ( although I 've obviously had 3 professional sprays ) and you must have an infestation somewhere . My guess is it will be in the carpet somewhere that 's rarely disturbed under a wardrobe , bedside cabinet , chest of drawers etc . Good luck and let us know how you get on <p> Ok Update Week 5 : Found No moths this week in my bedroom or bathroom and the moth trap was empty I checked under bed in wardrobe shook curtains etc and no moths I moved my desk and found no moths However I did find a lot of the " white cotton like / cakey stuff on the carpet and around the skirting not much . but i hoovered it up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a spot of paint was dropped on the carpet ( Its not paint as the cream carpet is only 5months old and all painting was done prior to carpet being laid . ) I can not see any damage to the carpet So progress acheived upstairs for now . <p> HOWEVER . last night mother ( Who believed I was exaggerating the problem and it was all in my head ) decided to clean the kitchen cupboards . and the results are not good . While any presses containing seasonings sauces strong scented foodstuffs did n't  contain any moths also these cupboards are used every dayin a corner dark press rarely used which has rice and pastas. &amp; cups she has found approx 15 moths even inside in an opened lasagne pack all moths were alive . no dead ( the dead ones are the females i assume ? ) also mother mentioned htat she has seen them previously in cups and took no notice as it was just the odd one . And so basically i believe that we may have na infestation in 2 kithcen cupboards Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room as the laundry would be taken from the clothes line outside ( somethimes at dusk ) and left in kitchen for sorting in the kitchen . and as i said previously the windows / door of my room is rarely open and i am there only at weekends . so i think after that saga we have a big problem . <p> I have bought 2 traps for the kitchen cupboards and lavender bags . so I am off home on Thursday night so will investigate further . <p> I have advised mother that we may need to get the professionals in if we can not control them she has said that as it is summer you can expect to see them and once we control and wach them it will be ok . <p> Limerick , are you sure yours are the common clothes moth ? I believe there is a species of moth that goes for food instead rather than the protein found in wool/clothes etc . At least if you know they 're mainly in the kitchen then the outbreak should be fairly easily contained and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat I 've kept all the doors to every room closed to try and prevent them spreading . If they 're only in your kitchen cupboards then with vacuuming and spraying I 'm sure you 'll shift them pretty quickly if they are the clothes moth , as they wo n't have much food to live on . Just make sure they do n't  spread into other rooms where you have carpets and wools etc . Good luck . <p> OMG OMG OMG : ( : ( : ( I have a moth infestation I moved into an apartment on the 25 April , I noticed the moths straight away but as I knew nothing of the HUGE problem they cause I just killed every one of them I sawuntil I went on holiday in June and when I returned the buggers had taken over ! ! ! The damage to the carpets was apparent when I moved in but I presumed it was wear as the apartment is old . On Sunday I decided to check my clothes for damage , its now Thursday and I am feeling depressed the more damage I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to the eye until the clothes are washed , and then only when between wet and dry . Dresses , jackets , jumpers , jeans , tops , almost everything is damaged ! Mostly along where I had folded them my clothes were clean . My agent had a guy over to spray on Tuesday . After reading your post and all the others I am now annoyed as well as on the verge of crying . I did ask the spray guy about the larve etc and he laughed the problem off . He did n't  even spray under the TV press , the blinds etc .. Moths are still present , they are not as many but they are definately still here . My agent said he would cover the damage of my clothes , does he know that I am a girl who spends most of her money on clothes ( I do n't  really drink etc ) ? ? ? What will he say when I tell him I spent 220 on one dress , 179 on another , 100 on jeans ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ALL my clothes are ruined apart from a couple of t shirts , even my trackie bottoms are threadbare after washing a few times ! ! The damage to my clothes becomes more obvious the more times they are washed : ( I found an artice on a reputable website telling that they damage 12cm of clothing in a minute ! ! ! : ( : ( I agree , they have made short work of my silks , wool jumpers , swimwear , EVERYTHING ( except as I said my t shirts ) . <p> Sorry to hear about all your clothes moth problems they are very destructive insects . <p> My friends situation is a bit different . She spotted the moths soon after moving in and complained to the landlord . The landlord did nothing . She complained many other times about the carpet moths by email and in person . Each time the landlord did nothing . <p> Her flat had signed up the her Universitys code or practice which says that the accommodation should be pest free . As she had previously complained multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of conduct she was able to lodge a complaint against the landlord with the University housing service . <p> The landlord did finally give her a months rent as compensation . She moved out as soon as she got this . <p> The damage only affected a small portion of her clothes so we were able to get them out of the flat , hot wash them , and move them to her new place in time . <p> Unfortunately for you it probably is one of those act of god situations . You have n't previously complained to the landlord so he would n't have been given a chance to fix the problem . <p> I 'm no lawyer but I doubt there is anything you can do to force him to compensate you for all your clothes . A goodwill gesture might be the best you can get . <p> Moths are very hard to get rid of so you might have to consider moving unless they are completely eradicated . Certainly do n't  go buying lots of new clothes just yet ! Theyll just be eaten again . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store any new clothes in . Youd just have to try very hard to make sure that the eggs do n't  get laid on any of the new clothes . <p> Oh now I am even more depressed .. on closer inspection of the t shirts I mentioned , they too are damaged : ( EVERYTHING both my daughter and I own are damaged .. the moths truely went to town in the apartment ! ! ! I contacted my agent to tell him of the cost to my clothes and he now wants proof of purchase etc .. I do have receipts and lazer card transactions . BUT , he also asked me did I not have contents cover and that there was no way the landlord would cover the cost NO insurance company covers the cost of moth damage , it is an act of god or uninsurable : ( ! ! ! ! ! so , he is coming over to have a look but as I say it is not covered and all I can hope for is a goodwill jesture . Did your friend get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ? After a couple of washes the real damage becomes apparent-things my daughter and I had worn most often ( and of course our favourite items ) are now showing very visible signs of large almost circular threadbare areas and can not be worn ( unless we try setting a new trend of moth eaten clothing lol ) I have to laugh or else I 'd cry ! The hardest thing I had to do last week was tell my little girl ( 10 yrs old ) all her clothes are ruined : ( I actually lied to her when she produced her build a bear teddy and its clothes to which there is also damage .. as I said , everything we own is ruined . marie : ( : ( <p> this is all horrible ! We have just discovered alot of larvae in my dauthers room . She had a dark corner with some toys and there was some uneaten food which must have attracted them . Do n't  know how long they 've been there as there must have been over 100 larvae attached to the toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten away . I have now lifted the carpet and am going to replace it . I feel I need to also lift the underfelt as although i cant see any more larvae , i do n't  feel we should take the risk of them being in the underfelt and eating threough the new carpet . <p> This really is horrible ! ! ! I am really freaked out by what i have read ! This week i have found at least 5 items of clothing with holes in ( not the clothes i never wear , oh no , all my best items of course ) . I have n't actually seen a moth in my flat , well not that i remember . The holes are really big though , i 'd say about 4 by 4 cms . Can moths do this much damage or could it be something else . I 'm pretty sure its not mice as i cant find anything at the bottom of my wardrobeand i have a cat ! I sprayed some standard fly and moth spray in my wardrobe this evening , will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wool sock with a hole in earlier in a completely different draw ! Please help.any advice would be gratefully received ! ! <p> Contact your local council who should have a private tenants advice line , or your local housing office if you are in a council property . They will tell you your rights . <p> I am so fed up and stressed out by our moth problem , in a way it makes me feel better that other people are getting as stressed as me , it means I am not overreacting ! <p> We had a moth problem in our previous flat so I assume we brought them with us to this flat , which we own . Weve done loads of cleaning and how found places with infestations . Today we found some under the iron door stop that we barely use . Since we 've done lots of cleaning we seem to only be finding one eveyr few days instead of a couple a day , so I hope it is getting better . <p> Hi Annie , Yes moths can cause that amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are coming from . Carefully check the carpets and in other dark places for signs of moth eggs and larvae . If you can find where they are coming from then you can specifically target your moth killer . <p> Thanks for the advice . I cant believe how much damage they have done to my clothes . Is this likely to be a seasonal problem , if I 'm unable to locate them will they die off in the winter ? Emily this is just the beginning of my problem and i am pulling hair out alreadyi seriously sympathies ! <p> I have had a moth problem since moving into my new home nearly 2 years ago , though in the last 6 months its a whole lot worse . I have 3 children and almost all our clothes ( and its quite a lot with 3 kids ) have holes in them . I have only ever saw appx 5 moths in the last few months although our clothes have been eaten since i moved here . The previous tenant had carpets and the whole place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff was removed before i moved in . I am assuming that they were here before i got here as i have never had this problem before . I have had rentokil out who charged near -400 for 3 treatments which i could ill afford , but the moths are even worse than ever . Due to a problem with my debit card , Rentokil havent been able to take the money off me and have sent threatening letters . I expected Rentokil to be able to rid me of the moths so did n't  think of getting any guarantees if the treatment did n't  work and as it has n't  im certainly not paying up . I did ask my council first , before Rentokil , whether they could help but they said they did n't  deal with moth infestations . Does anyone know if i have any rights with regard to this ? Its so utterly depressing , i do n't  think i 'll ever get rid of them . I cant move out either as i cant afford to , but then as i read on this site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have with them ( apart from eating all our stuff ) is that they are making me itch so i presume that the things are eating the fabrics as i wear them . Should i just throw out all the moth eaten clothes ? ( wont have much left tho ) . Would this help ? I do n't  have any carpets in my flat and i do n't  know where the root of the problem is . Even the bloke from Rentokil couldnt find the main cause ! I feel like like walking out of this flat and making myself homeless its that bad . Maybe then the council will help . Any advice from anyone would be much appreciated . <p> Lulu , is it your home or the councils ? If the latter then they will be under a duty of care to get rid of the moths . Having said that , I 'd strongly recommend using Rentokil they charged me -215 initially for 3 treatments ( I 'm in Leeds ) but I made sure that on the form/paperwork they included the wording " 3 treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 treatments over 8 weeks and touch wood ( fingers and everything else crossed ) I have n't seen one moth now in a good few weeks , but I 'm keeping vigilant ! So I 'd go back to Rentokil , sort the payment problem and tell then you 're happy to pay so long as they will give you treatments until they are eradicated at the end of the day if you 're paying hundreds of pounds they need to get rid of the problem for good , otherwise you 're paying good money for nothing . <p> I 'm surprised you 've got a big problem if your home is not carpeted . Do you have a loft have you checked up there ? Or cupboards you rarely open with clothing in ? My major infestation was in the carpet under a heavy wardrobe that was never moved . At one stage I also telephoned the British Pest Control Association , so they 're worth a go too if you 're tearing your hair out . Any clothes that are moth eaten need to be washed at temperature or stuck in freezer to kill any eggs/larvae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a council property . I called local CAB office yesterday and they told me that the council do not have to deal with problem as its not in their policy . They advised me to call Environmental Health which i did and am waitng for return call . However did this before and they said they did n't  deal with moths but only gave advice , so unless their policy has changed they wont help . I also spoke to Rentokil again and their area manager is coming out Monday so i will def. get the form changed to say " until the pests are eradicated " , before i pay up . It would be impossible for me to freeze all the clothes ( as 3 kids and myself ) but can you let me know what temperature to wash them on . Previously man from Rentokil said a 60degree wash would do it , is this the advice you got ? Thanks , Lulu <p> Reading the comments on here has filled me with some form of comfort by knowing I 'm not the only person suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel so traumatised and upset by it . I live in an old 3-floor house in London . Petrified of creepy crawlies at the best of times I notice every single bug in the house and was quick to realise that there were too many moths flying around for it to be just to be Summer-time moths coming in through any windows . I do now believe that the whole house actually has an infestation . <p> I work in fashion and as a result , have tons and tons of beautiful clothing in a variety of different fabrics . I see months flying around all the time recently and occasionally see them resting on bits of clothing ( probably laying eggs though I now realise ) ew ! I have consulted pest control who have advised that I wash all my clothes ( this will probably take weeks ) and bag them up until after he has fumigated . As I have been washing my clothes , I have first been inspecting them . I have not yet found any damage to clothing and I 've looked extremely hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was damage ? Or is it something that take a while to spot , e.g. it becomes more apparent the more times you wash things ? <p> The moths I see are tiny little , almost cream-coloured things and when you kill them , they seem to just resort to dust/powder , rather than being particularly fleshy ( if that makes sense ) . Presumably these are babies ? In which case , there must be parents hanging around somewhere . Ew , yuck , I 've got goose bumps just thinking about it ! Does anybody know whether these typically sound like clothes moths ? <p> About a year and a half ago , moths began blossoming out of a bag of ( avian-quality ) peanuts we had purchased for our winter bluejays and kept in a kitchen crock . For a year we tried " green " methods of deterrence : lavender and orange sachets , sticky traps . About six months ago we began purchasing aerosols of P-I from an extermination company with some results , and then began bombing hard-to-manage spaces like the attic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About the same time , I found someone to clean my grandmothers Persian rugs luckily ! and this third-generation rug specialist , an Armenian , began turning over all the Persians as well as the Turkish and Greek rugs on walls and tables and showing me my infestation . Worms ! Larvae ! My stomach turned . Then the hunt began . Blankets , an antique linsy-woolsy , more rugs , sweaters , skirts , my late aunts mink hat ( Yikes ! Who even remembered I had it ! ) , you name it everything went into the dry-cleaners or the laundry or into the garbage . Aged prematurely with all the long cycles , the washing machine broke down . That 's good I began to wash recklessly and shrank some lovely things . But now I have a new , larger machine . A good sleuth now , I even found pregnant females in the kitty litter . ( Females crawl , mostly ; the males fly hip-high . ) I have spent my summer vacation vacuuming cracks , filling cracks , inspecting sticky traps , blocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks lining the chimney . ) In the last month , Ive called in the professionals , and things are a bit better , but they do n't  seem to be using their imaginations . They spray the baseboards and any holes I have n't yet plugged , but the moths keep coming . They 're giving me a third visit and will bomb the rooms that are still messy with moths . Sometimes I think the only way to get rid of the moths is to dynamite the house , but then I imagine the moths rising from the smoke , hundreds of them , and dispersing , not killed at all . <p> The common temperature wash to get rid of them seems to be 60 degrees , but i 'm no expert ( this is whatve Ive seen on the web time and time again ) . Get Rentokil in to sort as you suggest as ( again touch wood ! ) I 've not had any moths now in a good few weeks ( I check every room daily ! ) , which I 've never had before since this whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole surface area of the floor AND if your clothing has been munched ( it was only my woolen carpet they munched , not any of my clothes in my wardrobes thankfully ) then ALL of your clothing needs to be washed or frozen and then placed in sealed containers or bags and then Rentokil should also spray your wardrobes or wherever your clothes were stored , otherwise there may well be eggs in there . During my treatments I literally had bags of stuff everywhere in the bath , on beds etc , so that none were on the floor as the little blighters love laying under bags/boxes etc that are rarely disturbed . Good luck . <p> Rachel , The cream/gold moths are the common clothes moth which is what I had in my flat . As I said above , they only ( I say only but there was a 2 foot x 1 foot patch of carpet that was totally munched threadbare under a wardrobe that was never moved ) munched my woolen carpet ( all the rooms bar kitchen and bathroom had woolen carpet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may well be munching your carpets/rugs. do you have carpets ? The adult males are probably what you see on your walls etc as the adult females do n't  often venture from floor level they love being in dark undisturbed places where they can lay their eggs . The young larvae are actually the things that devour the fabrics , the adults do n't  do any damage at all . Again , as I said above , mine took 4 whole sprays of the whole flat floors , over 8 weeks before seemingly theyve gone . You definitely definitely need at least 3 or 4 treatments and make sure if you 're pying good money that you make sure you get them to agree that for your money they will do treatments for you until they are eradicated , no matter how many treatments it takes . Good luck . <p> About 2 months ago , small light to dark brownish moths started buzzing around a plant in my house . Then , they spread all across the house . All we did was kill them ; we did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months later on August 25th , another moth , of many , flew into my sons room . He got fed up and searched every nook and cranny for that single moth . My daughter suggested cleaning the room ( because it was very messy ) . So , my son started throwing all of his clothes in the hamper and sweeping the floor ( because we have hardwood ) . He swept under his bed and found small , almost oval shaped worms squirming around . He also told me that he found some 2 or 3 hanging onto the corners where the walls meet . He started emptying out his entire room leaving all his stuff in the hallway . We washed some of the bed sheets and pillow cases in our washing machine using hot water in hopes to kill some of the worms , or larvae ( I guess ) that are most likely hiding there . I need help . My daughter considered an exterminator , but my son just wants to do it himself ( using the sprays and what not ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have carpet and no one in my family has reported holes in their clothing or sheets . <p> I feared writing on here that mine had gone would be a case of " famous last words " and lo and behold , last night I found 1 live moth in the kitchen and 1 in the spare bedroom ( where the previous main infestation was ) AAAGGHHH ! Have just phone Rentokil and they 're coming back out for another spray . As I 've said above , when you do initially get Rentokil in and pay your money , make sure you get them to agree to do treatments until the blighters are totally gone . Its like Groundhog day <p> Are n't  they disgusting ! I discovered we had moths about 2 months ago . I was i 'll in bed with flu and I noticed about 3 of them over a few days flying about at dusk , my husband killed them and I thought nothing more of it ! When I was better I cleaned our bedroom and vacuumed under a chair in the corner of the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2p . I then put 2 and 2 together and realised what had happened . I moved the bed out and there were quite a few more small patches of eaten carpet and lots of pieces of what looked like oat flakes behind the bed . I was horrified . I vacuumed up and then searching the net for info and found this site . We immediately ripped up the carpet and we threw out the bed and mattress , it was a divan with a base , I could n't bear the thought that it may be infested ! We have since laid hard flooring , we had to rip off the skirtings . I washed all the clothes in our fitted wardrobe , it took days and days . Incidentally I tumble dried everything on low , even my delicate clothes and they were fine , I believe this would kill anything if it were in your clothes . I bought lots of those vacuum seal bags and all our seasonal clothes , spare duvets etc are now stored in those . Everything in my wardrobe is in plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear plastic shoe boxes and all our shoes are in those . I put lavendar bags in our drawers and cedar rings . Thankfully nothing in those and no damage to our clothes . In our front spare bedroom we have the same wool carpet as was in our bedroom . I have only noticed 1 small patch about the size of a 5p and touch wood it has not got any worse . I am keeping all the bedroom doors shut to hopefully stop them spreading . We have noticed a few moths in the last weeks but hoping that we are on top of the problem . I found 2 tonight in our bedroom where they first occured . I do n't  know where they can be from as there are no nooks and crannies and a new floor . I am hoping they will have nothing to live off now . We have n't moved back in yet , still decorating , the gloss paint is very pungent maybe that bought them out the ones I saw . <p> I am concerned that we have a sisal carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Apart from that we only have 1 carpet left . They freak me out the thought of crawling things in the house yuck ! I will NEVER have carpets again after this experience . I bought a magnifying glass but have never seen any of the larvae people describe . <p> I am only just 12 But when cleaning my room i came across alot of moths flying around I just ignored it but as i cleaned futher i came across a corner of my room with a blanket i hadent lifted for months So when i picked it up there were around 90 dead ( or alive ) moths I am considering hovering them up Will this help ? <p> ok so i just had a large ( maybe 2+2 inches ) dark moth fly out of my wardrobe . Should i be worried ? Being insured for $30 000 against flood , theft or fire i would seriously die if my beloved clothing collection became damaged And i have had a moth prob in my kitchen in the past which was solved by though sealing and cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences on this site , literlly brought to tears by a few , can anyone tell me what they think of my circumstances . x <p> Desperation is an understatement . Weve been in our house for 33 years and the webbing close moths became apparent last September . Few flying adults were seen back then . Now In July I either caught or pheromone trapped 60 . In August it was 83 . <p> The whole year I 've spent going over every inch of this 7 room house . Every thing washable has been washed at least twice . Every thing else has been dry cleaned or frozen on the back porch last winter . ( It gets cold in Wisconsin ) <p> Ive used Ortho pyrithrin spray and vacuumed constantly . I even had an exterminator in , but they just send a kid with a tank . I presently have about 10 pheromone traps around . <p> Here is the mystery . I cant find the source or any damage . The state entomologist who identified the moths thinks the source might be outside our living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It might have started that way , but I suspect the part wool berber carpet that we had installed about 10 years ago . Another idea is that , since this is and old house there might have been a low level of moths that were spurred on by getting wool carpet . Big mistake . I 've seen them flying in every room except the kitchen and bath . <p> The only two options that I can think of is either have all the carpets in 6 rooms , the hall and stairs steam cleaned or have them all removed and refinish the hardwood floors . <p> Annie from what I have read they can live in the mild winters we have the in the UK , particularly as we keep our homes warm . <p> Bethany that does not sound like a clothes moth , they are small and beige and you would see several of them around . <p> Connell tell you mum to look at this website for advice on how to deal with them . <p> Rachel so far most of my clothes have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything made of wool including my lovely cashmere coat . in the flat they seem to be more interested in our wool carpet . <p> Some advice for everyone : they can live in wood furniture ! I lifted up an old chest of draws and tipped it on its side , and there were literally hundreds of eggs living in the cracks of the legs . It is a very old piece of furniture , and the wood was quite cracked . I have thrown it away . There are holes in the carpet where the wood was in contact with the floor , they have eaten the carpet . <p> I 've spent ALL my spare time for the last week and a half cleaning and washing . We have wool carpet throughout the flat , and I have found them under every piece of furniture , seen lots of eggs by skirting boards . Ive spent hours vacuuming , particularly along the floorboards , and laid down moth strips from Robert Dyas which seem to be working as I 've found dead ones and a dead larvae next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we stored a lot of boxes . I 've had a massive declutter so that we have the minimum on the floor . I washed blankets etc that were rarely used . <p> I have been in tears with the amount of eggs Ive found , I doubt I have managed to get rid of them all . Havent seen any moths today , but it is just a day . If my huge clean up has n't  worked , then I will bring in pest control . <p> Rentokil told me to store items in black bin bags . I did this after washing and lo and behold i noticed a little hole in the bin bag when i was transferring them to plastic box . Ive prob . contaminated all our clothes now by doing this as problem seems much worse . Everything i wear itches ( and i havent got that much left ) . I went to visit a relative the other day and while there i was literally watching my top being eaten i.e. a separate hole appeared to rival the others ! This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na go crazy . I had to leave straight away coz now i 'm worried i will pass them on to everyone else . Rentokil not got back to me yet but it seems i signed the contract for just 3 treatments and i have no guarantee . If they think i 'm paying them , theyve got another thing coming . My rant over and i hope your latest hit finally sees the moths off . Regards , Lulu <p> Joanne , i just read your post and i too could hear the same noises comimg from my curtains . Youve just made my day , coz i had been on the internet seeking answers to do moths make noise and could n't find anything . So , no i do n't  think you are mad ! Lulu <p> Emma We have taken up all our carpets , having inherited moth in our new house . We seem to have more than ever . I have heard that the eggs can live in the cracks in the floorboards , which makes sense as carpet fibres fall through them , and presumably there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chimneys , old mouse nests etc ) in a 120 year old house . <p> I have heard of an insecticide dusting powder which can sit undisturbed for several weeks ( as it is under the boards it wont affect humans is the theory ) , Does anyone know anything about this ? Any thoughts on whether it might work ? Where might I buy some ? <p> Since the eggs are impervious to attack something that might kill newly hatched larvae before they breed would be ideal , would n't it ? <p> Sheila , touch wood neither myself or hubby have seen any signs since I last posted on 27th August . I am hoping that I managed to catch it in the early stages and have sorted it , who knows I will keep you updated . We have a click loc floor over the boards now so there really are no holes left to come from . Do you plan to put new floors down or keep the floor boards ? May be a good idea to use some sort of sealent if so , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk about . I am still keeping my other bedroom door shut that has the last remaining wool carpet but touch wood looks fine in there too , but there are stories about eggs living 6 months etc are n't  there so I do n't  suppose you really know for ages . I think it is a good sign not to see the moths flying about though or even find dead ones . <p> Have people tried the thicker plastic hoover shrink bags , I got these off the internet and I think theyd be much more protective than the thinner dustbin bags . I am hoping if they do n't  have anything to feed off they will get lost ! <p> We had the most awful experience today . My husband discovered last week that his mother had a moth infestation when he thought he spotted one in her carpet and she showed him pheromone traps in her wardrobe covered in trapped moths . She has no idea of the nightmare that awaits her . But husband thought it would be worth trying some of these traps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought them home today , opened the packet to show me , and instantly a cloud of 30 , 40 , 50 moths flew up out of nowhere . ( We only see at most 5 a day on the walls , but recently have lost two kids coats to moth damage , and as I am expecting a baby v soon I am more stressy than usual . . . hence need for action ) . <p> At first we thought he must have brought them from his mothers flat , and he hurled his clothes and bags out into the yard , but as we leaped gracelessly around our bare floor boarded recently refurbished kitchen killing them , they just kept coming out of nowhere . Likewise upstairs moths out of nowhere in our carpetless house . Just now I checked the newly laid trap on our bedroom floor to find to my horror perhaps 10 . Thankfully there were none in the firmly closed wardrobe which I had just cleaned out and sprayed , and divested of our winter coats which are now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This means the moths are definitely in the cracks and crannies in the floors and skirting boards , in the door jambs , the window frames , and in the spaces between the joists . We cant afford to put down new hardwood flooring I imagine that well-sealed flooring would help to prevent them breeding or at least escaping , but clearly they are very hard to stop . I am ordering dusting powders as well to try and kill larvae , and we hope that the traps will collect adult moths before they breed the effect was so instantaneous that I have hope that we can hope for the best . <p> I do n't  trust any of the products really , but what else is there ? Cedar , lavender etc are all useless , it seems to me , except in that prevention is better than cure . I do have a lemon sachet in my sweater shelf which i credit with having spared my cashmere so far that and the plastic bags they are wrapped in . We live in a big Victorian house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected before we moved in , and it takes me days to clean from top to bottom not a complete spring clean even but just thorough hoovering and dusting and tidying cupboards . So I feel worn out already . <p> But do you know , it occurs to me that I do n't  even mind of no-one ever reads this it makes me feel a whole lot less lunatic to know that other people need to write about their moths too . Thank you everyone ! <p> Ill post again after the baby to let you know whether there has been any improvement in case anyone is in fact reading this apart from Emma . . . <p> Hi Sheila , oh no , that is horrid , I feel so sorry for you , I bet that really freaked you out , it certainly is n't the kind of stress you need before you are expecting too . I really hope the traps and powders work for you . Good luck with the baby ! Emma <p> Hi Sheilia can totally sympathise , i have 3 children and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when i leave them on the radiators to dry . I have no rugs carpets etc. which is why , i guess , the clothes are their main food , so i agree with you that they must be in all the nooks and crannies . A friend advised me to buy a mastic gun and tubes of decorators caulke and fill every hole possible , if only at least to elimate areas where the main source could be ( as no-one can find it , even Rentokil ) . I was given some traps from my council and whereas before i very rarely saw the moths , since they were put down they seem to be flying everywhere . So obviously the traps do work although i 'm disgusted to see so many of them . I 've got all my kids clothes in plastic boxes and i only take them out in the morning to iron them before school or going out . Its a bloody nightmare and takes over your life . Will let you know how i get on when ive filled in all the holes . Lulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a fortune that we never had ! The moth traps do seem to mean that they fly around everywhere and it is vile . But after about 3 weeks of traps they are reducing in numbers . The traps filled up very quickly in the first week now we only have a couple a day . We have tried everything now , and the traps are the most reliable . I bought the dusting powder and the entire house looked like Pompeii for a week , covered in heaps of brown dust it did kill some moths but I have no way of knowing the effect on eggs and larvae .. I also have strips of Rentokil insecticide paper which is meant to kill moths larvae and eggs in the wardrobes . But we also decided to try the mini smoke bombs , which we set off in all the bedrooms and finally in the cellar . And though I hesitate to speak too soon , it seems to have swung the balance in our favour . I think ours are mainly in the cellar . We are planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortnight . I do n't  know for sure whether they work , but the flutterings have decreased noticeably . Unless its the cooler weather . ( What I do know is that Protector C spray is useless a puddle of it will kill a moth , but its definitely not residual ) . So I will update in a month or so to let you know whether the intensive campaign of bombs works . What I have n't figured out is whether the self-help products arevany different to the so-called professional products in other words what can Rentokil do that we cant do cheaper ? Sile <p> Hi .. thank god for this blog . We have found an infestation at the weekend in our dinig room . I was hoovering every half hour . We are going to rip the carpet up to try and find the eggs and in the meantime Nippon spray have halted them crawling out and up the walls . Where do I get the smoke bombs and traps from . thanks . <p> I went out to a concert tonight and was having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itd been eaten away ! My gorgeous Paul Costello coat that I only bought last year and cost me -200.00 . My evening was ruined ! At first I thought that maybe it was cigarette burns or someone in the restaurant had spilt something on it , but when I looked closely , there was no residue and it was all very neat and clean ! I could hardly wait to get home and I checked on the sofa where my coat has been lying for a couple of months ( its a winter coat and the sofas in the guest bedroom ) and low and behold what did I find crawling around ! ! ! I went straight onto the internet ( what a blessing ) and within minutes found a mugshot . That was 2 hours ago . Since then Ive been back and forth between my computer and the guest bedroom . I 've squished 5 , but by the sounds of it there could be hundreds of eggs . I cant see any eggs , but apparently they 're smaller than a pinhead . Its too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbours ) and I suppose I feel slightly better having read other peoples horror stories of the many items of clothing they 've lost . I lost a cashmere sweater once to the blighters but that was years ago and the problem did n't  reoccur . Now I 'm starting to panic slightly as the holes in my coat are dreadful . I suppose I should throw it out , but I feel just awful as it cost me so much money and until it had holes in , it was my all time favourite coat ! I cant see any holes in the sofa or any of the other fabrics left on it ; some were cotton , others sythentic . The bugs just seem tove gone for the coat . Does this mean if I get rid of the coat the problem will go away ? Or should I keep the coat and just squish the monsters when I find them ? ? ? I 've learnt my lesson and will NEVER leave clothes lying around on the sofa ever again . But here 's my question does this mean we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy woollen or cashmere clothes ? I thought in an ideal world we were supposed to go for the natural alternative where possible . Help .. Im confusedand under attack ! <p> Well we seem to have made a break through , after doing sooo much cleaning under furniture and along skirting boards . We literally moved everything that was in contact with the floor several times over around a month to clean . <p> Over the last 6 weeks I 've kept up the regular moving of everything in contact with the floor , but less frequently . 2 weeks went by without seeing any , then saw 3 within a few days . Again around 2 weeks went by and then saw a couple . Around 2 weeks has gone by since then . Now when we move the furniture to clean underneath , we are only finding the odd cocoon or cluster or eggs , rather than lots . <p> So the secret of our success seems to be not storing things under furniture , e.g. under the bed , which is where we saw the most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using moth paper and the hanging moth repellant from Robert Dyas . <p> We have been holding off switching on our heating , as the warmth makes it easier for them to breed . I am concerned that once we do we may see a resurgence . Fingers crossed we do n't  . <p> Hi everyone ! Its good to hear that you seem to be making a breakthrough Emily . I 've never seen any eggs so I 'm not sure what I should be looking for . My father stripped the covers off the sofa where my coat had been lying and its been to the dry cleaners . Sadly my cashmere coat had to go : - ( I put a teddy made from mohair in the freezer for a week . I could n't see any damage on him , but he was on the sofa so he had to have a cold spell for a while . I 've also thrown out a pair of woollen trousers that had holes in . I killed one moth that appeared , to my horror , in my bedroom , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Emily you 're absolutely right . The trick is to not store things in dark cosy places that are going to be undisturbed for long periods . I think I need to take out all my clothes from the wardrobe and cupboard and give everything the once over . Man does this take over your life ! Apparently the larvae feed on animal products such as wool , cashmere , silk , fur , because they like to eat keratin , a form of protein . Yuk ! <p> Well it had been over a month without seeing any , and for the last couple of weeks I 've been daring to believe we had got rid of them . But tonight we saw one . I know it is only one , but that means there is still something going on . Frustrating . <p> It is definitely much better than it was though . <p> HP in answer to your question about whether we should avoid buying woollen carpets etc someone was saying on here that they have a moth problem despite having no carpets . <p> The battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults . Ive been over every inch of this house and came close to having the carpet removed . I still havent found a source or any damage . I think its taking up my whole life.and mental health . <p> Weve pulled back the carpet and put down powdered boric acid and diatomaceous earth between the quarter rounds and tack strips . We found only a rare moth casing , but spooked up a few adults . With 6 carpeted rooms , stairs and a long hall it took some time . <p> I use pheromone traps from Insects Limited . http : **25;390;TOOLONG Since I have webbing clothes moths I use the traps that sit on the floor . I 've found that the more adults in the trap , the more they catch so do n't  toss out the old ones . The entomologist that I talked to said that they communicate in ways other than pheromones so that when they are trapped and still not dead they attract others . <p> I cant imagine where they are coming from , but the other entomologist thinks it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . *tearing my hair out* <p> I have also had the pleasure of moths eating my clothes and reading all your comments is a real help ! So I 'm trying my best to do everything I possibly can to kill them . But I have one question do I have to throw out my clothes that have holes in them , or can I just get them dry cleaned ? Does anyone know ? <p> Amy I would throw them out but maybe that is over the top . It is better to be safe than sorry . I had a bag that had loads of them in it , and I washed it at a very hot temperature , but after it had dried out more of them emerged . <p> Well I have n't seen any since that one over a month ago . Just before Christmas I had another big clean , moved all the furniture and found no evidence except for one dead moth . I think we have finally got rid of them . I would like to think that cleaning lots and lots under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as possible in contact with the floor ( e.g. not storing things under the bed ) seems to have done it , plus using anti moth paper . But I suspect that the particularly cold winter has helped . We have made an effort to keep out flat cool during the winter ( wearing lots of clothes instead ! ) to try to keep the moths away . <p> we even bought a new washing machine but we still had the problem . We have n't seen many moths in our house , the annoying thing is they only seem to eat my Husbands designer clothes . I bought him a Hugo Boss T Shirt to start replacing his clothes , it came out of the machine fine . I put it in the bathroom with my ironing ready to to the next day , as I started ironing it I found one hole . He wore it albeit complaining , I washed it again and started to iron it ( today ) only to find at least ten more holes ! This is now driving us mad Has anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of their clothes eaten ? We have tried everything , I may even more house , but will I bring them with me ? Cie England . <p> Hi everybody . I bought a new coat in the sales to replace the one eaten by the enemy . Well see how long it lasts . It was comforting to hear the tale of woe told by the shop assistant in John Lewis . She said that she 's battled against the blighters for years ! <p> I understand that its predominantly animal products they go for , cashmere , silk and fur , but what I do n't  understand is how fast they work . If you check your clothes every day and shake them out would that work ? But manhow time consuming ! <p> The shop assistant in John Lewis said that the only solution shed found was to store her clothes in those vacuum packed plastic bags ; you know the ones you have to use a hoover to suck out all the air . However , this only solves the problem of clothes you 're storing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be interested to know what the t-shirts made out of . Where was it in between ironing and the next holes appearing ? <p> Amy-if you can either wash your clothes on a really hot wash or put them in the freezer for a while then they should be ok . I threw out my woollen trousers because I did n't  want to wear them with holes in . I 've kept one of my jumpers . Stupid really because the holes in the back near the top in a really obvious place so I cant wear it anywhere I 'll be taking my coat off ! <p> I 've just put some horrible chemical hanging things in my wardrobes and balls in plastic that are supposed to smell of lavender but actually smell revolting . However I agree with Emily that the frightfully cold Winter were having must surely help to put them off . <p> Cie-Ive just been thinking . Are you sure its moths and not the washing machine that 's causing the holes ? I had a similar problem years ago when a washing machine wrecked an item of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was becasue the spin cycle was too viscious . Worth considering ! HP <p> HAS ANYONE ELSE MORE EXPERIENCE OF INSECTICIDAL SMOKE BOMBS ? I 'm very interested to read all these comments . My house is about 150 years old and was really badly treated before I moved here 10 years ago . I have been waging a war on destructive moths since I discovered several damaged pieces of clothing . I have been using moth balls , brought in Spain and impregnated cards in the wardrobes . Very frequent cleaning is difficult to undertake and I have trouble moving the furniture around on my own . I have a particularly badly damaged wool carpet in my study which I have cleared to lay a new synthetic carpet . After I take up the old floor covering I need to tackle the cracks between the floor boards . Ive read that there is an organic spray product called Oa2ki or would FortefogF be better ? What do people think ? <p> Seen lots of mid brown moths around and found a whole load of white tube types things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting holes in cotton t-shirts and the woollen clothes have been left alone . Admittedly the clothes have been sitting about in my ironing pile . I 've also had big chunks of carpet eaten around the edge of the living room . Has anyone else had mainly cotton clothes eaten . What sort of moth does this sound like ? Do n't  think I could cope with washing everything ( especailly as some things ca n't be washed hotter than 40 degrees ) and clearing and cleaning all wardrobes and cupboards . Anyone found a cheap &amp; easy solution to the problem ? <p> I have recently found lots of tiny holes in my t-shirts . I have already got lavender sheets in my draws and closets , as lavender is supposed to repel moths . The sheets are not working and the holes are driving me crazy . My draw is made out of cedar as well , so I have no new ways of getting rid of the moths . Can anybody help ? <p> I have a serious infestation of carpet moths and have decided to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laminate flooring , but am concerned that the moths might want to eat this too , can anyone advise me please <p> Dear all , I was glad to find this blog and feel that I am not alone in this horror . I hope when I am writing this your troubles have gone already . But I feel I need to write about my experience and maybe someone will find this information useful . <p> I have been dealing with moths for such a long time now that it looks like forever . First , when it happened I honestly thought I will just run away from it , which I tried by cleaning everything I could and moving into another apartment . Unfortunately , moths do not mind travelling too and if you have unnoticed eggs in your furniture , cloves or anywhere else they will sure come with you . As frustrating as it is I am now getting over this horror . Even though I am not entirely finished with it yet , I hope that Rentokil will get me there . <p> Before I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control company named company <p> I talked to them explaining that moths was a longstanding problem in my house . They somehow ignored it , so I ended up paying over 200 pounds for nothing , i.e. , 2 treatments lasting 15 minutes each , mind you , I have two bedroom flat , it is not one room we are talking about . The results of their efforts were catastrophic for my wardrobe , since I relaxed thinking that miracles do happen and after two visits my moths would disappear , and of course it did not . <p> When I rediscovered that the problem is in fact increasing I called company , and it turned out they LIED about 3 months warranty they promised to provide . Instead of helping , they said that I brought it on myself again by buying new stuff , but they agreed to give me a discount for the nest two treatments , so now I was supposed to pay another 100+VAT . I panicked and agreed . <p> However , at the same time I invited Rentokil to come in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion I made is this : Rentokil is cheaper , since they do not charge you twice or thrice ( I am going through my 4th treatment next week , and only paid once -200+VAT in total ) Rentokil is much more professional , since they go to your flat and inspect it before the treatments are made ( company never even suggested inspecting ) And above all Rentokil stays with you through this painful process really trying to help you out , instead of adding charges and insults to the already devastating experience . <p> Hi , I 've just begun going through this horrible experience . Reading this has freaked me out all the more coz up until now i was just going by other websites that said Vacuuming did the trick . But it has n't  worked . I 'm now arranging for Rentokil to come in and inspect my flat . Does anybody know if ripping out the carpets and changing the floor to laminate wood flooring might solve the problem for good or is the problem likely to recur even with laminate flooring through the underlay ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooring you mentioned above ? <p> Have not yet changed the flooring due to the expense that is going to be involved , but will hopefully be doing so in a couple of weeks and will let you know the outcome asap . The moths I have only seem to be interested in my wool carpets and as yet touch wood have not made their way to my clothing , have put up some rentokil moth traps in my wardrobes however just in case . Can you believe it is National Moth Weekend this weekend and they want us to preserve moths habitat and lifestyle lol ! ! ! ! Good luck Sue , let me know how you get on . <p> I must have picked up moths from my old rented flat where I discovered a woollen slipper had been eaten but was oblivious then to exactly what a problem these things are . I have now bought a house and my lovely antique carpet wall hanging is infested . They seem to have spread to another small rug which i just threw out because it was n't hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clothes . Aaaaarrrgghh ! ! ! ! The rug where the main infestation is is too big to fit in a domestic freezer and although I could probably fit it in a launderette machine , I do n't  know if washing it may damage it . Anyone know what the best way to treat it would be ? Do these sprays really work if you use them enough ? <p> reading all these stories has made me hope to god i have got rid of these pests .. i noticed loads of these clothes moths flying round my flat and sitting on walls bout 4 days ago.i turned the place upside down hoovering and cleaning but they always returned .. yesterday i went mental and scrubbed the place top to bottom moving furniture etc .. it was only when i went to empty the hoover that i found the nest ! ! that 's where the little b .. ds had made there homeso i hope that 's the last of them .. i squished 2 or 3 this morning , and havent seen 1 sinceso check the hoover folks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pests . I have never had such a problem before and its horrifying ! Do they get in your mattresses ? ewww ! <p> I have put everything into tubs , and all my clothese into clothing bags and vacuumed sealed bags , and all my stored items are sealed also . They got into our valuable turkish rugs , and so I have vacuumed and sealed these also with mothballs . I 'm so depressed by all of this and quite overwhelmed . Everything is in sealed bags and I do n't  feel comfortable in my own home any more . <p> My neighbour ( I live in a condo ) had to rip all her shag rug out and put down laminate . I think they probably got into my unit via the hallway . People have complained about the smell in the hallway , but in my opinion they should be happy that I am so vigourously fighting these pests . <p> Hi , i have clothes moths and Rentokil identified that I have the common clothes moth ( supposedlyIm not quite convincedthey knew what they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten times , we have used smoke bombs and various insecticides.we hoover daily , we can not find a source.nests , have sealed crevices , bought a new mattress and we are currently at -2000 worth of damage to colthes only . I have been replacing clothes since last January and fighting this problem for a year and a half now.I today took everything with a whole in it from the house . I have laundered clothes to the point of ruin , tumble dried , frozen and steam ironed seams . I have emptied my entire house regularly and inspected clothes for evidence of larvae and never EVER seen one . My clothes get eaten when I am wearing then and my stomach itches all the time whereby I wonder if the larvae are actually on me . I have tried absolutley everything and I keep a very clean homeI have now resorted to double sided tape across my carpets , Shave &amp; Vac sprinkled everywhere but no hoovered upand my wardrobes and drawers filled to the brim with fragrancestill nothing works . I have had my loft fumigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as very difficult to empty all of the time ) . I am relived to see others have suffered from itching and had their clothes eaten whilst wearing them because people I know think Im completley nuts .. which is n't helpful and their assistance to hoover and clean would be better . I have been told there is n't any product on the market that will kill moth larvae and research tells me these things can remain in their larvae stage for over a yearand keep eating ! So.any tips would be welcomed as an elderly person said to me when I was trying to deal with themyou will just have to live with them.I somehow think he knew that they do not go once you have themwell not for a while from what I can see on former posts . Good luck I am considering dry ice nowbut somehow i do not think these things are in cracks and crevices ans they seem to eat the same item of clothing on more than one occassionI even think I have both types of moth ( never found a case thoughor seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( <p> a tipbecause we have childrenwe used to when we got undressed put our soiled clothing straight into soakand set the washing machine to go on in the middle of the night ( as they even seem to get in there ) this preserved clothes for a little while longer .. but I have to be honest an say " they got the item in the end " . They never ever eat my gym clothing that I have worked out ? ? ? So I just wore a new top that i did n't  want to get eaten to the gym howeverit is now ruined : ( Today I felt like selling my home.but i know this is n't the solutionwe have purchased kittens though as we feel they will catch anything crawling around at night ( even though my top eaten today whilst I was wearing it was during the day light hours ? ? ) I feel better now but feel bad as I know anyone reading this will feel worse . its a very bad problem to have : ( <p> Hi guys-just scrolling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with moths the best way to get rid of them is if you can freeze the contaminated items at -40 , this is not likely for many of us but even a freeze for a week or 2 in a domestic freezer might help . It does kill the eggs and larvae , but if you have something tasty the moths will find it again ( anything tasty is anything animal based with proteins or even cellulose ie : fur , feathers , leather , wool , silk , sometimes cotton , and even synthetics with small amount of natural fibres ) . So I suggest also getting some pheromone traps , this attempts to catch them before they mate and the cycle starts again . check out http : //www.histryonics.co.uk for traps etc- that 's who I use , also amazon does a whole load of stuff . <p> I 've got this problem too and will try to use Tick powder for dogs under the carpet to deal with this problem . I have no pets but will give it a try . Carpet under my sofa has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first house in April but little did I know that it was infested with Moths . I fear that maybe why the owners left . I did n't  realise what it was at first but there was hundreds of lava on the carpet and cellings and I would see a handful of moths daily . Since I have moved in I have ripped out the carpets and bleached each corner of the house . I have also ripped of the skirting boards in the living room and I am going to get the cracks plastered up . I am still finding moths and lava ! It is very depressing . I am finding the lava on the walls . Whilst the problem seem to quieten down once the carpets were ripped out it now seems , a couple of weeks later , to be going back to how it was when I first moved in . I am not sure what else I can do . Moving out is n't an option yet I do n't  fancy having to live with this . I have a one year old boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products but I also do n't  want him to have to share his house with these pests . Please help , apart from ripping out the carpets I cant think what else to do . I have so many clothes and blankets that the thought of lugging bags and bags full to the dry cleaners is a tall task ! Any ideas ? <p> That sounds like a bad situation ! Removing the carpets sounds like a good thing to have done if they were eating the carpets . <p> Have you found where the eggs are ? The moth eggs can stay active for a long time so if you do n't  get rid of the eggs you 'll keep finding new larvae and then moths . Killing the moths and larvae will prevent them from laying new eggs , but if you still have hundreds or thousands of eggs somewhere in the house then theyll keep appearing . <p> The larvae do n't  move too fast so the eggs are likely to be near to where you find most of the larvae . Kill the eggs , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones then the problem may be curable . <p> Hi , thanks for your reply . I have called rentokil and they are coming on Thursday so I shall see what they have to say . It is an odd situation because since ripping up the carpets I cant say where the larvae ( sorry previously wrote lava no volcano problems just yet ) is coming from . It was obvious before and there were so many eggs in the corners . Now there is n't any , I just find the odd egg on the wall and moths randomly throughout the house on the walls . I am thinking that ripping up the skirting boards probably produced more moths to fly out . But today I have n't ( fingers crossed ) seen any . I will keep you updated but since reading this blog I am fearing the worse . Had anyone out there had success in getting rid of these pests ? I agree and think getting rid ot the carpet was the right thing to do it was infested with them so gross . Ironically I have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lol <p> Hi I too have had problems with these moths , but only discovered them after they had decimated my sons wool carpet and chewed holes in my clothes . I bought a Pheromone trap from my local shop for -4.49 , this included a clear plastic trap and one Pheromone Pad . One month later and the pad is almost covered with male moths . Because this product works so well I decided to find out where these are manufactured . I am now selling them on ebay for -2.99 which included one clear plastic trap and two Pheromone Traps . I can also supply more Pheromone pads for 99p each or 10 for -7.50 . My ebay user name is bug-busters look me up I can promise you if you have these moths you will be really pleased with these traps . On my listings I have included a photograph of the trap with the moths so that you can see for yourself how effective they are . <p> Hi all fellow victims , Recently discovered we have a moth infestation in our 4 year old 80% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old centrally heated house . After about a week of daily cleaning ( we are both retired ! ) , heavy furniture moving , spraying and researching we have come to the following opinions : 1 ) we probably brought the moth eggs with us from our previous 100 year old large house ( no central heating ) inside some old oak furniture . 2 ) these moths hate light , so cant be trapped that way . 3 ) the only effective and persistent insecticides ( lindane etc. ) that would kill them were banned from sale in the EU several years ago . 4 ) the insecticides currently available ( pymethrin and its sound alike siblings ) may give the sods a nasty headache for a while , but that 's about all they will do . Natural smellies like cedar and lavender are only mildly effective , if that . 5 ) persistent hoovering and cleaning will perhaps reduce the numbers of adults you see , but do not get at the root of the continuous re-infestation which is the eggs . 6 ) new thinking is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It seems to us that if it were possible to hard boil or poach the eggs in situ we might begin to get somewhere . Any new thoughts or comments gratefully received . Any friendly professional experts out there ? <p> This may be my imagination but I have noticed that clothes hung in my newish wardrobe tend to be chewed . I have an old wardrobe that came with the house that has a strong woody smell to it ( possibly Cedar ) and the moths have not touched the clothes hanging in there . I do n't  ever remember when I was younger having problems with clothes being chewed so I do wonder if it is the changing climate . I feel that this is going to be an ongoing war with these creatures . Maybe a good hoover on a regular basis would help as I notice that the worst area for my sons carpet being chewed was under his bed . This was hoovered much less than the rest of the carpet . Regards Pauline <p> I 've just found this site after discovering we 'd got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from brand new ) since 1993 , had house cats for ALL of that time ( hence fur ) and have NEVER had a problem before . We 've had a local reliable pest control man in and fingers crossed for the present . HOWEVER , I ca n't help making a connection between the moth discovery and the fact that we used a VAX carpet cleaner for the very first time only a month or so before all hell broke loose ! Our pest man did n't  set too much store by my theory but it would be interesting to know if anyone else has made this connection . I 'm wondering if the moisture the VAX created helped activate the larvae . Methinks the VAX has had its first and last outing here . Best of luck everyone Nettie . <p> The only way to get rid of carpet moths completely is to switch to synthetic carpets and get rid of anything made of wool/silk etc in your house . I have had this problem in my current house for over two years and have only just managed to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped out the wool carpets and got synthetic ones fitted . I also sealed upI the cracks in the skirting boards with a foam gun as I found out that moths love to hide there . I now do n't  buy any clothing containing wool . <p> My flat is infested with clothes moths . I live in an old property and they are breeding under the floorboards . Ive been gradually taping along every gap in the floorboards and this summer I have not seen nearly as many of the moths about . I 've still got two rooms to do . Ive been asking my neighbours and they also have them and other people along the street from me . All those who have similar infestations that Ive spoken to also live in the same type of old flats as me with wooden slatted floor boards . I gave up spending money on sprays and pheromone traps as they did n't  seem to solve the problem for me . My local council does nothing to help people with moth infestations now . <p> Dear All Sadly , I too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never seen any larvae or eggs ( occasionally I find moths but they seem to be larger than is described above sometimes even about 1 ? long ) , but ever since I moved into this flat I have been noticing more and more holes in my clothes . Every time I put something on I find one or two new holes in it . At first I thought it was a coincidence I 'm a student and a lot of my stuff was old , but now even my newer clothes have holes in them . I entertained the idea that it was the washing machine here , but my boyfriends clothing , which is kept in a different room , seems unaffected . I do n't  understand though I keep all my clothes hanging up . How do the larvae get on there and why do I never see them ? Is there anything else that could be causing the holes ? Does home/contents insurance cover this kind of thing ? Thanks , Izzi <p> The clothes moths can fly onto your clothes in your wardrobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larvae eat your clothes ! You should be able to spot some sign of them . Have you tried thoroughly going through your wardrobe and checking each item of clothing ? Also check the rest of your wardrobe in case they are hiding in the corners . <p> I doubt any insurance company would cover moth damage but you 'd have to read the small print . <p> We have had Case bearing clothes moths now for the last few months . Came in on a second hand sofa that we were given from somebody on freecycle ( who must have known and simply used Freecycle to dispose of an infested sofa rather than pay for it to be taken away grrrrrrrrrrrrr ! ) It has so far cost us over -400 with rentokil and they are still far from gone . We have nearly all of our clothing in big zip up laundry bags and are keeping all of our laundry outside in bags until washed.We have chucked away all of our rugs , both of our sofas 9as completely infested ) taken down all of our curtains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrooms left with carpets ( we have wood flooring everywhere else ) we are still gettting them everywhere . It is an absolute nightmare . What amazes me most is that they are far from dumb creatures and are incredibly adept at escape when you lunge for them . I have seen some literally drop vertically to escape then fly horizontaly near floor level into the nearest crack ! Best way to flatten them seems to be coming up from behind them and squashing them with a thumb ( YUCK ! ) as if you try to swipe them with a swatter or shoe they use the gust of air created to escape . It is disgusting beyond belief ! <p> Rentokil have been continuing to come in and said that they wo n't desert us until they are eradicated but not sure that they really know what to do either . they have started to set pheromene traps but from my research and expereince ( I already have some ) these do not attract this kind of moth so do n't  think that this is going to work sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only cocoons and for the first time last week we finally found some larvae but under a completley synthetic laundry basket on the laminate kitchen floor ? ? ? ? ? ? ? So not where expected at all ! Needless to say that laundry basket is GONE ! <p> So those that are finally free of the little beggars please do keep posting to give the rest of us some hope ! ! ! This is such a nightmare as we have 4 little children ! <p> I first found approx 100 rice grains under my sofa , felt sick .. Researched and realised that I had carpet moths .. Bought a kit on the Internet Inc c spay , talc , and smoke bombs . I hoovered non stop . Pulled the skirting board off and found hundreds more of eggs . Only recently I have noticed moths flying around so moved furniture again and found a few more . So am going to have to start again I cant stand the thought of them lying around . I have big patches eaten of my carpet . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't got anything to munch on which I will replace with a synthetic one as my carpet is 100% wool . <p> I 'm not sure where to start really I have just stumbled upon this site whilst trying to work out exactly how to get rid of my moths . I started noticing them earlier this year then they died down and as soon as we got to about May things really kicked off . I live in a 1920s house with lots of cracks and hiding places . Eventually after finding about 30 on the traps I had left out I called in rentokil . We searched the house and found an old rug full of them . I cleared out my attic bagged everything in the house up . Everything fabric is in the shed waiting for its turn in the freezer . I was told freezing for anything over 48 hours works . Anything I could find with eggs on was thrown away . I was charged -400 for three spray ( although they say they will keep going until they are gone ) . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aquapy as I have two small kids . There is no sign of damage on the carpet which we have very little of . They have bomb the attic three times now and there is nothing fabric up there . We are living out of plastic bags and all the kids clothes are in the boot of the car . There was n't too much clothing damage considering how many moths I have seen and how many clothes we have . They only seemed to attack things with wool in it even a small amount . There is now almost nothing fabric left in the house but I am still finding them , a few a day on the walls . Some of them look almost all black . They have taken over my whole life . I have even had dreams about them . Will they ever go away ? ? ? ? Its a nightmare especially with toddlers . Oh God just seen another one . I cant work out where they are coming from ? ? ? ! ! ! Feel like moving although wed have to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Hi , I have not read the entire thread but I have read that a few people are having problems with their HAND WASH only CLOTHES , you can put these items and any other in plastic bags and put them in the freezer for 48 hours . This kills the eggs and the larvae . You need to clean as you move clothes about , if you are taking clothes out of the wardrobe or drawers you must clean them and I spray mine with poison before putting the de-frosted clothes away again . Do not put wet clothes in the freezer and do put them in a bag as this will stop them getting ice on them . You can often find larvae in the bottom of the bag when you take your clothes out . Many years ago people kept their fur coats in cold storage for this reason . <p> Thank you very much for replying to me . I have checked all my clothes and havent seen anything there , other than the holes . When my partner is back I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere in the room . I have to confess I have been reluctant to do so because I am worried I will find something completely disgusting ( like 100s of caterpillars and eggs ) and not know what to do about them . I am so happy that I found the online conversation otherwise I would have had absolutely no idea at all ! <p> Oh my word , i can totally sympathise with those who have moths . I had them in my last property , which i had fumigated . I have moved back to my parents house and alas think ive bought them with me as ive spotted a few around but ive no idea where they have been hiding i got everything of natural fibres dry cleaned . Gutting . It can really get to you , i worry about them ! It can be so costly with dry cleaning , spraying etc . Oh what to do . <p> Im having the same problem with moths . I live in a private rented flat and it has woollen carpet throughout . Since we moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to locate where they are coming from . They have damaged the carpet really badly in one room and I 'm afraid that my landlady is going to hold us responsible . I 've contacted her about the problem and she in not so many words has implied that we have created this problem ! We are very clean and I 've lived in rented housing for eight years without ever having this problem . I 've tried to find information regarding our rights with this matter but I 've had no luck so far . Any help would be much appriciated . <p> Further to comments 93 and 94 ; According to Second Nature ( UK ) Ltd and the CAT site , the wool used for house insulation is protected by a 10% solution of BORAX ( which may still be available to the GBP at Tesco ) ( ? ) . I have not yet tried this out as a carpet spray . Anybody else ? On a more optimistic front : Hoover , hoover , steam and spray Suck , cook and F*cam that 's the way To rid your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We seem at the moment to be winning after a lot of effort and a fair bit of expense . <p> Ficam is available on line for amateur use , but needs to be used with care . Follow the instructions to the letter ! We used the brilliant and inexpensive Earlex 125 steam cleaner to cook the skirting board/carpet boundaries no harm done to anything except , possibly and hopefully , moth eggs , ( We feared the carpet would shrink but were prepared to ditch it as a last resort and if necessary . ) We used the steam jet here and the carpet cleaning attachment where we did n't  fancy spraying Ficam . Use slowly and get the temperature well up ! We sprayed with Ficam in places we could keep out of for a while . We dusted all areas of carpet usually covered with heavy and inconvenient to move furniture with insecticidal dust ( ant powder ) and hoovered up the surplus from around the edges once the furniture was put back , so the chemicals were excluded from our own accessible environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred compressed wool fibers as nearly all the damage we found was in the depressions under the furniture edges and supports . We had found pupae in rooms without carpets so we steam jetted all the skirting board boundaries everywhere , including bathrooms ( which seem to contain enough " house dust " to attract the very mobile caterpillars from adjacent areas ) . NB They feed on keratin hair , skin flakes , wool fibers etc . <p> Anyway enough of this for a while . We look forward to any useful input and will post further info as it comes available . <p> I have recently seen lots of small moths about , even though I have cut my wool carpet about 10 inches away form the wall , I moved the chair and found lots of larve under there . I have re sprayed and put the dusting powder down . I think I might have to call someone out as they seem to of turned into moths now and the problem could just get worse . <p> Further thoughts on post 108 ; 1 ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( disodium octaborate tetrahydrate harmless to humans ) and you shampoo it ( as opposed to steam cleaning ) you may reduce the concentration to less than say about 2% . This may leave you open to attack by carpet moths ! A document " Risk of Insect Damage to Thermafleece.pdf " is available from Second Nature and contains relevant info . 2 ) Do n't  assume the " rice grains " you find are empty . We sealed some in an old screw top jar and discovered that many contained very alive , hungry ( cannibalistic ) and mobile caterpillars . Some have climbed up to the lid , hooked on , and now turned into adult moths ! <p> I 've never had quite as bad a moth infestation as some posters , but I thought it might help if I explained how we 've managed to keep the clothes moths under bearable control in our Edwardian c.1900 London flat with its permanent low ( but higher than acceptable ) level of infestation . <p> I have a LOT of fabric ( both animal and plant derived wool , silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room incl. wall hangings , although we do have synthetic carpets . We 've only got the standard golden coloured moths and woolly bears type prevalent in S. England . The key is to be disciplined with the cleaning and the tidying up . <p> The moths arrived in around 2001 , and over the years we have developed the following routine , and stuff is very rarely eaten now ( including woollen tapestries out on the wall all the time ) it only gets eaten if I get lazy 1 . Hoover the synthetic carpets and skirting boards &amp; edges ONCE EVERY week in every room , moving easy to move furniture at the time , and shake out all cushions etc . This disturbs the newly hatched insects of all sorts . We have a cat who likes socialising with the local foxes ( well terrorising them ) and it keeps ticks/ flea problems away also . 2 . ALWAYS have a Mottlock or similar Moth Pheromone Glue Trap in every room , and replace them at the recommended intervals ( do n't  be tempted to leave them longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive as replacing carpets/ cashmere jumpers etc . This removes the males from the equation as they get stuck on the traps then any hatching females are less likely to get fertilised eventually you end up with very few females getting fertilised and then they lay unfertilised eggs , then there is n't much to actually hatch out . Then the problem becomes controllable by a decent cleaning routine . Its also a good indicator of the scale of the issue . 3 . KEEP all clean folded clothes in plastic boxes we 've got an Argos shelving unit with 10 plastic boxes for tshirts/ trousers/ jumpers etc . ALWAYS keep lid on box unless actually using it AND NEVER EVER leave any animal fibre ( woollen ) clothes out &amp; about in the house for more than a couple of hours . Yes , its boring being this tidy , but it works ! 4 . Have cedar blocks and cedar balls and the Sandalwood powder sachets ( sold by John Lewis &amp; Lakeland Plastics ) in the Wardrobe ( its an open fronted wood/cotton one from Argos ) . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food shops ) as I ca n't be doing with all that sanding down about once very 8 weeks , but do n't  put them back with clothes until oil has dried . 5 . EVERY MONTH take out all clothes from wardrobe and shake them onto a sheet on the bed , which is then itself shaken outside and put into the wash . Checking if there are any holes or obvious signs of larvae etc . ONCE a year , hang out clothes on washing line outside in strong sunlight . Also do the same for coats hanging on general coat rack . 6 . EVERY QUARTER move ALL furniture and hoover underneath &amp; around it . ( It was monthly until we got it under control ) . 7 . Every QUARTER ( if no obvious infestation ) or every MONTH ( if there is , or more often if necessary ) , take down wool tapestry hangings from walls &amp; other furnishings and gently hoover them ( tie a duster around the vaccuum hose and put on lowest setting if its very delicate textile ) and SHAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty washing in a similar plastic box , do n't  leave the ironing around not done for ages and keep moving and airing clothes . The moths hate light and movement . 9 . Use the cleaning routine as an opportunity to assess whether I really want the stuff I 'm shifting around , or whether it can be given a good home elsewhere ( once I 'm sure its infestation free by keeping it in sealed plastic bag for a month , if no sign of moths after that , its ok to go . 10 . Use the steam cleaner on Wardrobe clothes when there is an upsurge of infestation . 11 . Do n't  panic and do n't  get depressed . Accept minor losses occasionally as part of life . <p> So , if I 've got it sorted , why am I looking on the net for advice ? Because were leaving the flat , the belongings are going into storage and our clothes &amp; us are moving in with the parents . So how do we make sure that were not taking the infestation into storage/ parents house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff into boxes that has been cleaned OR which has been living in plastic boxes and is infestation free anyway . ( Its easier for me as I 've got the problem under control and Ive never had the experience of nests of eggs just one or two larvae every month now on the clothes ) . 2 . To clean wash at high temperature OR dry clean OR freeze OR steam OR hoover OR iron ( or any combination ) depending on the article . And if its a textile that has Keratin in it ( wool/silk etc ) put it into one of those plastic vaccuum bags ( I do n't  believe moths can live without oxygen ! ) 3 . Do n't  mix newly cleaned and non-cleaned items , keep them separate to reduce cross-contamination. 4 . Aim to take over the empty chest freezer at parents for all clothes to reside in temporarily on arrival to minimise problem . Then , keep airing &amp; moving clothes &amp; checking them and use Mottlock glue traps to keep tabs . <p> Sorry its so long , but this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been relatively cheap and we 've managed to avoid pesticides . <p> Was on here a while ago with moth problems and have since moved . I took nothing with me , threw out wardrobes , beds , sofas , beds , curtains , all clothes , towels , coats , shoes practically everything save for special items which i boxed up and sealed and left in my new homes garage . After moving in , i removed everything i and my children were were wearing including shoes and coats , threw them out . I had bought us all a few bits to wear and ordered new furniture . Shouldnt have bothered , within two weeks the problem was back . Am I picking them up from somewhere else , or are my kids bringing them in . TBH I wash all our clothes immediately , have even plumbed the washing machine to the hot water tap as i thought perhaps the temperature on the washing machine was not working properly . I wash my clothes , dry them on the line , iron them and put them on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starchy white marks , and soon after holes appear . This even happens when I buy a new top and put it on immediately how can this be ? And it happens no matter what the fabric is . Like Nance , I itch and like another person said , i too , have holes appear while i wear clothes even though i 'm out in the daylight . Ive come to the conclusion that even at the hottest wash , the larvae stick on the clothes , and then when in contact with the body they feast in a frenzy , which is why the holes appear so quickly . I have noticed that when i remove the top , the frenzy dies down dramatically . I store underwear and nightwear in plastic lidded boxes , but i have just noticed a hole in my little girls nightwear . So if this is infested and i have put it in the box with everything else then i have contamined everything . My father has a problem with moths , and i am fairly sure that my ex does too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of these places , surely by washing our clothes immediately on a hot wash should have prevented me from getting infested again . I cant bear the though that I have to live the rest of my life like this i can not afford it for one and it makes me feel so dirty when i am actually extremely OTT when it comes to cleanliness . <p> Hi everyone , you 're post hearten me and horrify me at the same time ! Its nice to know I 'm not alone in the problem and with the stress . I bought my first house almost a year ago , and little did I know ! When I first figured it out ( from the gaping holes in the carpet where the previous lady had had her furniture and the hundreds of moths you could see hopping about ) , my father and I pulled out all the shag pile carpets from the bedrooms ( to find polished floorboards that was a gift from above ) . I still have carpet in the main room and hallway they do n't  seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year I have not seen any moths or larvae . The pheromone traps have nothing in them . But , just now , as spring approaches I 've started to find the holes in the clothes . Sigh . Spent the weekend vacuuming everything , before letting go a couple of those flea bombs ( with Permethrin and IGR ) . Note to anyone else who decides to do that do n't  use Permethrin if you have a cat ( hopefully I have n't poisoned mine ) . Much as I 'd like to think I can eradicate these little buggers with time , I have n't seen much hope . So I 'd like to share some of the positive things I like to tell myself when I start to stress ( I 've been repeating it to myself to keep my sanity ) : 1. they 're just clothes . 2 . At least the cat is not being alive . 3 . All the housework is great excerise and think how fit I 'll be ? ! . 4 . Ill have the cleanest house ( if you dicount the moths ) . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been fighting against clothes mothes for years but i think i had it under control until i became pregnant . I used to hoover every day and once a week used to move things in at least one room but when i became pregnant i slowed down a bit i did not clean because of the moths more because i 'm a bit ocd. i had to take it easy during pregnancy then i had a C section then i got ill NOW OH My i finally moved the couch to hoover that 's over 10 months ( i know really bad but its so heavy ) i know where they are coming from , huge holes and powdery surface on carpet . Before i 'd see a moth maybe once and a while now i can squash probly over ten a day plus the ones my cat catches . I just kept buying traps in the last few months i recon thousands were caught . I 've not actually had too many clothes damaged they did go fo a expensive wool coat . tonight i 'm moving everything whilst baby is asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many chemicals surely they wo n't like it . i 'm burning and making cedarwood oil patches . plus citronella which All insects are suposed to hate have the traps down anyways and i 'm calling the landlord on monday . i wish i had been able to keep on with my useual cleaning but i couldnt and even now i 'm not supossed to do any excercise but i just cant bear the thought of the mess i found under my couch . My baby now plays on the floor just the thought of those horible nasty things makes me ill . Why cant we not get rid naturally .. maybe that 's whey i kept getting spiders as its like a resturant in my flat . <p> I thought I had got rid of the problem but no they 're back . Two new very soft cotton designer tops have holes in the front = always in the same place . 3 years ago I had my bedroom ( which is always where the clothes are damaged ) sprayed on 3 occasions . I made sure to keep clothes in cupboard or wardrobe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became complacent and now a lovely sweater has been eatenas well as the tops . I am at my wits end cos I do n't  know where they are . I will have to replace the wool carpet with synthetic but are they in my mattress which is top of the range . I have painted walls so no wall hangings at all and not a great deal of furniture . I feel so depressed reading these blogs as I have lost count of the clothes I have had to throw away . I rarely see a moth but probably one or two in the summer . Can my clothes be getting eaten by something else beetles , or wood lice maybe ? I have checked the mothholes with a magnifying glass but can see nothing . These clothes are in the freezer now . <p> Has anyone heard of fumigating moths with dry ice ? Supposedly it kills moths in all stages if you leave the dry ice in a bag of clothes for 3-5 days , by starving them of oxygen . see the link below ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them too can one buy the dry cleaning agent and spray that on carpet , in closet , etc ? ( I discovered I 'm highly allergic to all the sprays out there ) . Please advise as I have also been dealing with this for one year now . and ps I have NEVER seen any moths anywhere I 've been told this is normal any insights ? <p> OMG , I have major infestation , and do not have option of doing a geographical . I think it is Karma , as I have been unable to declutter my life ( as in clothes ) and now have clothes damage to a lot of my clothes , I have found the source which was an old motorcycle helmet stores on top of wardrobe , nice sweaty lining that they were feasting on . <p> I am alarmed as I have read the thread from the beginning and it seems that the scoreboard is heavily slanted to Moths winning . I live in Australia , and it is hot and humid now ( summer ) and we have the mildest winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to tackle the problem . <p> Hi all So on reading all the posts , ( well almost ) , I am convinced we are in the same situation . I have them along the skirting boards where the carpet ends . Under beds , and in fact in areas which are well lit too . Not sure what can be done , but the damage is bad enough , and the wool carpet is old enough , for us to rip it out and live with awful looking floorboards will things settle again . <p> Horror story . <p> Anyone have any good news ? Something that will work for a whole house infestation ? <p> If you are based in the UK and need help . Please contact me on 0203 189 3412 . We are making a new property programme for Channel 4 and have experts who may be able to help . Alternatively , email me on sukh.s at redhousetv.co.uk and leave a daytime contact number . <p> I want something that tells me about the lifecycle of the moth attached to relevant months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know when is the best time to search , to spray , clean etc. if that is relevant possible . Thanks a lot . I too have found this blog comforting . I am not alone . <p> A cashmere jumper I got for Christmas was eaten 2 holes appeared from nowhere . I froze it several days and washed at about 60 degrees ( although this is not good for cashmere ) . I left it on sofa for days before getting round to stitching holes . All okay . Then took it to my bedroom ( which I know is the contaminated area ) got dressed , wore sweater and travelled to London . Upon arrival several hours later , took off jumper to find new hole and it had even eaten through into my thermal vest underneath ! I refroze , rewashed , stitched hole and wore this yesterday . Today I took it ut of its plastic bag to find two huge holes again at the front , as always . Got magnifying glass and found a live larvae ( first I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tops eaten in this way and found nothing , no larvae or moths ever ) . Found trails of dead larvae in fibres . Should I just throw this expensive garment away ? I am at my wits end as have found silk top , also peppered with tiny holes . This is so stressful , I am almost having a breakdown . Are they in my wool carpet , my mattress ? A few months ago I did wash down skirting boards , wardrobes , drawers and replaced with new cedar balls , lavendar sachets etc . Nothing of my husbands has EVER been eaten . Why ? <p> I have just found out 3 days ago we have a Case Bearing Moth infestation . We moved in the property at the end of December and we were finding what looked like bits of fluff hanging from the ceiling in the lounge , we just got rid of them as thought must be bits of dust or something and thought nothing of it . It was only when we started finding them frequently and when I found one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet and found that they are Case Bearing Moths . Funnily enough I had a Pest Control man at the house yesterday as I had a Pigeon stuck in the vent where a fireplace used to be , so I took the opportunity to ask him what I could do about the problem , he said you MUST use a powder based insecticide as spraying is not effective to the eggs and does n't  last long enough . He would n't really help as I 'd only called him out for he pigeon but when he left I looked up more about this type of moth and a lot of sites were saying hoovering with a brush nozel may help so I spent the whole day doing this yesterday and I found loads but only around the skirting of the carpet(edges) , I then moved on to the hallway and have found that the carpet we thought was worn when we moved in is actually patchy with clumps missing due to the moths . I pulled up the carpet and underneath is infested . They were also in all the gaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them . They are only eating the carpets nothing else . They are ONLY in the lounge and hallway . I have looked thoroughly upstairs and there are none and no clothes have holes in , its literally just downstairs . I 've also not seen any flying moth , however I am PETRFIED that they will spread to upstairs . I 'm also afraid of putting down any sort of insecticide as like many of you I have a toddler and I 'm also pregnant . We are looking to move out and do n't  want to take them with us . They are SUCH a pain and very upsetting as my family are funny about coming over incase they spread them to their houses . Anyone got any success stories on the Case Bearing Moth ? Disgusting things and making me feel sick whenever I eat I think about them I am becoming obsessed with finding them and also found that they wrap themselves in their own silk , fabric they eat and wait for it .. feaces .. *puke* <p> I , too , have recently discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is fixed to the wall with overhead cupboards , and it means that in order to clean under the bed I have to take the mattress off and lift the slats . Of course I do n't  tend to do that very often as it kills my back . Last week I noticed what I thought were tiny pieces of shredded tissue on the floor but on closer inspection I discovered that they were larvae cases . The larvae have eaten holes in the carpet . I have since spent days meticulously vacuuming all of the carpet edges and places where I know they are likely to be . Ive been down on my hands and knees going through the carpet to find them they really can bed themselves in deep . I was shocked at how many there were . I do n't  know if I will ever be rid of them I have pets so do n't  want to use pesticide . I 'm looking into pheromone traps , and in the meantime am being vigourous with my cleaning regime . So far its just the carpets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear wool , so for once that is to my advantage . <p> hi there , i am in the same situation as a lot of you above . i bought a Persian carpet from seller godisalmighty , on ebay. and found a year later that a large part of the carpet was eaten away . i would like to take legal action against the seller who is refusing to refund or replace the carpet . any advice or contacts regarding this matter would be very helpful . thank you in advance . <p> Just a quick update . It seems I have killed them all off . I have hoovered thoroughly , especially around the edges of the carpets . I went out and bought some Rentokil insect killer spray and 2 large tubs of ant and insect powder . I have ripped the hall carpet up ( not something we were keen on doing but it was that or not sorting the problem ) What they seem to do is mostly live underneath the carpet and come up for a chew . I covered the whole area thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the lounge the infestation is n't as bad as the hallway so I am just spraying the edges every night before going to bed ( so that it is settled and dry by the morning have a toddler running about ) I have not found any live ones , all are completely suffocated and dead , the powder I highly recommend as it starves any eggs lying about aswell . I will say though if you are finding the Larvae around the skirtings there is a good chance you 'll hoover them up but then find more coming back , that 's because they are living underneath as I already mentioned . Also would n't worry too much about the sprays or powder being dangerous , the powder I got was also for in the home use and the spray is only highly dangerous to aquatic life if the tanks are not covered while using them . @Charlie I was told by pest control a lot of carpets that are from abroad carry the moth . Not sure the seller would have known this , even if he did I wouldnt have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be claimed they infested the carpet after you bought it and were from your home . Good luck . <p> This website is very helpful and comforting , but I also found it worrying that people are getting this upset by these beasties . <p> We have had a moth problem for 5 years and just when we think we 've conquered them , they re-appear each spring like clockwork . <p> I ripped up carpets and replaced with laminate downstairs , threw out sofasSTILL THEY CAME ! <p> I have old floorboards upstairs with big gaps in them , and in the summer we regularly find between three/five a night on the ceilings and walls . I can only assume that because my boyfriend is hairy , his sheddings are falling down the gaps and driving the feeding moths crazy ! <p> I have used Protector C for the last year or so and found that it did reduce the amount of moths quite significantly . However , you mustnt get lazy as they will reappear over time . <p> Best advice : do n't  get OCD , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , do n't  chuck away all your belongings and buy new onesjust makes it even more upsetting when they come back . Old people I have spoken to say these were hugely problematic back in the day and moth balls were the norm . Maybe it was hotter back then ? I do n't  know . <p> All you need to do is keep on minimising the growth of these pests and rest assured they will not live in the fabric where you mainly socialise , so who ultimately cares ? Yes , they 're foul . Yes , they make me shudder , but you have to put it into perspectivetheyre bloody tiny and they cant actually harm us . I stopped freaking out about it years ago and now just calmly take them on as I find them . <p> Wow I have been reading all of the posts here over the past couple days and am surprised that this conversation is still quite active 2 years later ! <p> I am off to buy large bins for all my clothing and I will be adding moth balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We cant yet find the infestation but every time I see a little moth on the walls I envision hungry larvae chewing away somewhere ! Most clothing , carpets , etc. seem to be unaffected . My husband and I have loads of clothing though and some of which I have n't gotten to yet . I plan on packing up everything , treating it , and being vigilant about what we wear . <p> My wool/silk blend curtains are shockingly spared so I will dry clean and pack them as well . YIKES what a mess of everything these little pests cause . <p> hi all . found this page and have read with much interest , especially as its been going on for so long ! I started my moth problem over 7 years ago and have no idea where they came from , can only assume a flatmate brought them and kindly left them as a present . I have since moved 3 times and the damned things have come with me . At the moment all I feel I can do is squish the wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing out my massive stash of wool for knitting helped : ) Only just got carpets fitted in my chilly old house ( trying to keep the place cosy and lower bills ) and I 'm hoping I bought a synthetic carpet.lol . I 'd agree with the above post in that they are a total pain in the ass , and it is hard not to feel dirty and ashamed of this pest in your home ( especially when your friends have moth phobias , which a few of mine have ) but do n't  throw your life away . After having my son I put on a ton of weight so I got rid of most of my skinny clothes , so that 's kind of helped , but I hoard ( who does n't  ? ) so to try to get rid of these pestys would mean taking so much time out of my life to organise and clean , etc , its not worth it , there 's too much , itd be like painting the Forth Rail Bridge . Squish em.and if you see a maggoty baby , squish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I too have an infestation of moths around two years now . We have the case bearing type which due to the red carpet made them easy to spot when they wriggled up onto the wall as the case is the colour of what they have been scoffing . We have replace two bedrooms with new carpet . I pulled up the old ones and hoovered the be jaysus out of the floor boards and we have not had them back since in those rooms . Although I must have another check around to be sure but no adults flying in the rooms . Then in my own bedroom I noticed a small bald patch on the carpet moved some furniture and the small patch was a drop in the ocean compared to the large area when I hoovered that was completely stipped of wool and then under my bed . I spotted hundreds of the buggerscreepy crawly yuckyI went bananas with the hoover and made moth repellents as per a home remedy website with lavender and natural herbs etc . That did n't  work not only did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth they were inso I have now again today pulled up the carpet in my room and the underlay and the wood strips . I found lots and lots of eggs in and around the skirting board . They are hardy little things and not all getting sucked up however I got a paint scrapper and went under the skirting scraping them out and smushing all around . I think I must have nearly all of them after doing that . I wont put down anything on the floor for the next week or two and keep hoovering like a fanatic to ensure if any hatch they are caught but it means hoovering everyday but if it keeps them away then it worth it . I will lace lavender oil all over the floor and cedar wood and hope for the best . Worse thing is they are in my youngests room too now under the cot so tomorrow same again . It costs so much to keep replacing the carpets and from what ive heard you need to get the professionals out again and again . <p> Anyway best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating machines . <p> I just want to echo what xrayspecs said ; do n't  let it take over your life . They are bloody annoying but they do not present any health risks and having them is not a sign of uncleanliness , as evidenced by some of the people whove posted here who were/are extremely diligent in cleaning their properties . I see it as a war of attrition . At the moment its really bad because of the warm weather so I 'm killing about 20-25 a day by squashing them . Come the autumn they will suddenly disappear again when the temperature drops . I think the next time I move I 'm going to bin practically all my clothes and certainly all bedding cushions etc . <p> Like everyone here we have problems with moths . They are only in the carpet for the moment . I tried dusting with powder and spraying several times but they keep coming back . <p> Can anyone please help me with some information Given that the moths are eating the carpet , does it mean that it has wool ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rather worn out anyway but what carpet should I buy ? I saw that there are carpets with fully manmade fibres , such as polypropylene ones but does it mean that they will be fully moth-proof ? <p> Thank you for this article ! ! The photos of the larvae are really helpful . It looks exactly like one I found crawling near the headboard of my bed . <p> We rennovated our house over two years ago . We replaced the carpet with hardwood floors and we had new closet shelves and drawes installed . And that 's when we started noticing mothsafter the reno . We have no idea where they came from but we have now filled our closest with cedar mothballs and it seems to help control them . We do see moths from time to time though but thank goodness no more larvae sightings ! One was gross enough . <p> Now that summer is here I 'm planning on storing all my winter sweaters in vaccuum sealed bags . Washing , then storing . <p> I 'm also looking into throwing away my down duvet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may becaome a place for the moths to lay eggs . <p> hi , i 'm so glad you posted this , atleast i 'm not the only one : ) i had the same problem last year and thought i got rid of it , but i keep finding more moths . i havent had a chance to check for larvae yet , need to do ver . soon : / but i 'm 13. i cant afford any traps or sprays etc. ive told my mum but she blames it on my pigsty of a bedroom my room is actually really tidy since the moths last year i have a carpet ant loads of dark , undisturbed areas in my room , i cant afford to replace my clothes and my mum will go mental if they 're ruined : ( any ideas ? ? ? ? ? <p> Hi everyone I 've been dealing with moths since September when I moved into my current apartment . We did spot a threadbare patch on the carpet when we moved in but the landlord thought the previous tenants had done it when moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought they were brown flies of some kind and had come in through the window we saw very few of them during the winter but in the last few months theyve infested not just one room but all five rooms ! I did spray them lots with various killers and vigorously cleaned and vacuumed on a regular basis but the moths have finally got the better of me and I am moving into a new house this weekend . Thankfully the new house only has carpet on the stairs ( our moths love the carpet , I can count at least ten holes ! ) so I 've been concentrating on making sure the clothes are moth free despite only ever seeing two in my expansive collection of clothing ! Everything is being washed at a high temperature at my mothers house , and all of my shoes are being frozen and then everything is being double bagged in binliners and will be stored in plastic boxes in the new house hopefully this will eradicate the problem ! I do plan on getting some traps too so that if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new house well be able to spot them straight away and keep on top of it before they can establish themselves ! <p> When packing up my things ready for the move I found moths and eggs in the most unlikeliest of places which makes me think were not going to be able to get rid of them completely . I found eggs on a PVC belt and even lodged inside a bundle of nail files , yuck ! I found four dead ones inside a melamine bowl in a picnic hamper , perhaps the liked the wicker ? They are beyond disgusting ! I 've thrown out hundreds of pounds worth of stuff clothes , rugs , my cats bed , towels , everything . <p> I 'm seriously hoping the house move will get rid of the horrible things ! Good luck to everyone else dealing with these horrible pests ! <p> Hi Jackie , I just saw your post , I have n't looked on here for ages . Thankfully touch wood yes the moths seem to have been cured , we have n't had any more . I think getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one wool carpet left in our front bedroom which I will get rid of soon , we are going to change the floor in there . Apart from sisal then on the stairs all our flooring is tile or wood . Our new bed also has a gap under which makes it easier to clean under . Personally after that experience I would never go back to carpets again . I think I got OCD with it lol ! I think it is easier said than done to stay calm about it , I fully understand and sympathise with anyone who has this problem . I did n't  feel comfortable in bed with the thought things were flying and crawling about . I also still keep my clothes with covers on in the wardrobe . Thankfully I never had the experience of them eating clothes I wore . Good luck to you all getting rid of them . <p> Reading these posts right from the beginning has been very helpful and has prevented me from taking panic action . In my case , I found one bald patch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on a round-the-world backpacking trip . Luckily I enjoyed my trip , leaving a house-sitter in charge ; I was blisfully ignorant and truly believed that ( a ) all modern carpets are surely mothproofed nowadays and ( b ) my newly purchased Dyson is so powerful that it even sucked up some loose carpet fibres , leaving me with that bald spot ! <p> I returned home last December to find a few more bald spots in the bedroom carpet and still believed that the Dyson was responsible . I got down on my hands and knees with a magnifying glass but was unable to detect anything ( the carpet is the same colour as the pests ) . Two weeks ago I spotted the first moth nonchalantly flitting about my house and since then things have reached crisis proportions . <p> I wake up in the mornings now to find three or four " bed companions " on my pillow and in my bedclothes . . . the wriggly larvae , defiantly staring me in the face ! Have they hatched from eggs in my expensive Kingcoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duvet ? Are they in my pillows and bed cusions ? Or have they simply made the long upwards journey upwards from the carpet underneath my bed or from the skirting board ? <p> Thorough cleaning and pheronome traps have not deterred them . A close ( but not too close ! ) look at the carpet underneath the bed revealed a skeleton floorcovering somewhat like lace . <p> I 'm quite prepared to throw out the carpets and the existing underlay , as they 're about thirteen years old . Will I have to remove the skirtings and throw out the mattress and bedding too ? <p> I reckon we 've seen the advent of SUPERMOTH . Is this where horror stories begin ? <p> I also have this problem but it is not as bad as a lot of other peoples . I noticed about a week ago a small moth flying in my bedroom i got hold of it in a cup and took it outside . a few hours later i noticed another one but ignored it . then a few days later around 9 oclock at night i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of them and took them outside . as soon as i returned to my room i seen 3 more and started to worry . i got them out and then went to bed . the next day i researched moths and found out exactly what i have and i thought it was coming from my wardrobe . so i cleaned it out completely and found nothing . i then got loads of lavender air freshners and put them in my room and pulled my bed out and cleaned under it that 's when i noticed in the corner of the room on the floor about 6 moths . i immiediatly hovered them up then hovered everywhere in the room . i searched the carpet then ( which by the way is sysnthetic fibre ) incase there where eggs or larvae on the carpet as well . it is the next day and there and there are no dark spaces in my room ( i have been sleeping downstairs since ) and i have only noticed one moth and got rid of it . i have just hoovered my room again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this bad as i took action very quickly to stop the situation getting bad but i would not like it to continue or get worse . I want these pests gone before they damage any carpet of clothes ect . They are disgusting and i want my room back . <p> A few moths have been seen in another room but no where else ( that room is my sisters room so i do n't  really care as long as they do n't  spread from there haha ) . <p> Where are the eggs that the moths have layed and the larvea ? will they spread accross the house of just my bedroom ? will they be gone now that i have completely cleaned my bedroom ? <p> I do n't  want to have this problem like some have you have . how can i stop it before it gets as bad as all of you ? <p> Hi . I live in a privately rented flat which now has a moth infestation . I 've lived here for 4 years and the moths it seems have lived here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet and i have now got Rentokil in and had the 1st of 3 sprays . My question is , am i responsible for the cost of Rentokil and/or for the cost of replacing the carpet when/if i move out ? My landlord seems to think its my responsibility but any views would be appreciated . I rang Citizens advice bureau but they were worse than uselessThanks <p> All of the above gives me some comfort that my husband and I are not alone in our so-far 3 year fight against clothes moths . 3 years ago we moved into an old Victorian house in London with a loft extension that had cheaply been finished in plywood ( the interior ) which meant there was small slits between the ply pieces . From the moment we moved in , I knew there had to be an issue as I kept finding both live moths in the house and smudgy smears where the previous occupants had squashed them on the walls . After some investigation , we discovered that in the loft extension , rather than use traditional fibre glass insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to use supposedly treated lambs wool insulation . BIG MISTAKE . Our builder helped us saw in half the plywood walls of our loft conversion and inside the walls we found what can only be described as the most disgusting sight ever -moth metropolis FULL of larvae , live and dead moths , millions and millions of eggs falling over the floor obviously an ideal environment for them , all dark and warm with a ready food source , where they had been allowed to breed undisturbed for about 4 years . They were also in the insulation in properly plastered walls which meant we had to have builders and plasterers in to rip apart these walls , take the infested lambs insulation out , professionally insecticide the void , replace it with normal stuff , and replaster and redecorate . It has been an absolute and mega expensive nightmare and to everyone out there NEVER EVER EVER buy lambs wool insulation in a misguided attempt to be enviro-friendly ( previous occupants efforts completely obliterated by our use of insecticides to get rid of the problem ) regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 2 years later , after a relatively moth free period , we have seen a few more on the walls and therefore was straight on the phone to the pest controllers who duly resprayed the house . Unfortunately saw two more over the last few days , just above/next to the cupboard where all my husbands clothes are so am going to spend a fun weekend boiling his clothes in the washing machine before pest controllers come back next week . To cap it all , I am now pregnant so I have to be very careful around all the spraying etc . It is truly a nightmare and I feel very sorry for everyone here as it just seems to be an impossible problem to totally eradicate which also causes a lot of emotional distress . <p> I 've just read the postings from Jess and CC and I would like to pass on my sincere commiserations . It did occur to me that my roof area might be insulated and this might be the source of my own moth infestation problem ( I 've never gone up there but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Saturday , as he only stays at weekends . ) <p> Insurance policies do n't  provide cover for damage caused by pests , hence your landlords reluctance to pay for new carpets , CC . But its not fair that you should be held responsible for a problem which only becomes visible after significant damage has already been caused . Would your landlord be willing to go into arbitration on this matter ? This is a fair process used by those who want to avoid the cost and hassle of the courtroom and an impartial judgement is usually arrived at . I would imagine that the cost of the remedial action ( to include the fumigation treatments ) would arrive at a fifty-fifty solution . <p> In the meantime ( between last weeks posting and todays ) I advertised my problem on my Facebook page and some nice person is sending me neem oil in the post . Sprayed in diluted form into all hatch-worthy crevices , and used in tandem with a thorough twice-weekly vacuuming and dusting regime , it is claimed to keep the moths under reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they decide to live with you , theyll never , ever , completely go away . All you can hope at best to do is to become their master and not allow them to dominate your environment ever again . <p> I got an infestation of common clothes moths in my wool fitted carpet about a month ago . I found this site on day 1 or 2 and it was v v useful , especially all the latest posts , thank you all for sharing your experiences and advice . Knowing I was n't alone was a huge comfort and all the advice was brillliant . Thought I 'd hoover them all up . Armed with a head torch , like a miner ! magnifying glass , hoover schnozzle etc I began ripping the fitted carpet away from the walls and hoovering the ***** out of the carpet and floor edges . Became totally obsessed ( OCD ) hoovering 2 -4 hrs an evening . Then , having believed the attack was restricted to my ground floor 2 living rooms , they were found en masse on an old full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought the coat down from my loft as I had n't  worn it for about 20 years ! I had decided to dispose of it somehow . Well , I did , immediately the moths were spotted on it . It went into a double bin bag and straight out into the garbage bin ! ! Thus I knew the moths were everywhere . So after a couple of weeks I decided to take control of my life again . Called in the professionals Rentokil . Paid for 3 treatments + further if the pests reappear within a reasonable time frame after last treatment . This cost -550 ! ! but I got my life back and my friends . I was in danger of losing them all as they were so bored with my only topic of conversation . I 'm glad I " bit the bullet " and stopped the solo fight . i have confidence that they will cure the problem . I think I was onto the moths soon after they arrived which was lucky . However I will have to get rid of the carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges . Rentokil say the only way to prevent further attacks is to get rid of wool carpets and either replace with synthetics or to go for polished wooden floors . This will cost mega bucks . Am going to approach my insurance company to see if theyll cover any part of the whole exercise . I had never heard of moths that eat carpet ! I am not a young thing ! I have never had clothes moths in my clothes , tho I recall as I child my mother put moth balls in our winter clothes when she put them away for the summer . She also taught us to always ensure they were v clean as she said that it is the food on the clothes that the moths go for and then advance to eat the clothes themselves . Clearly that was erroneous . anyway so far as my inspection has gone my clothes have been ignored , also my knitting wools . The latter were all in plastic bags already and I got them out on day 1 of my attack and double plastic bagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government are considering declaring clothes moths a national crisis . See Daily Mail on line of today ! ! I only further add to the advice given by several posters on this site : Do n't  get obsessed like I did . Take charge of your life and call in the professionals . Once the moths are exterminated life will return to " normal " . PS the worst part of all this is that I 'm a practising Buddhist and do n't  kill anything until I met the common clothes moth . Now I am doomed to many lives of hell to pay for the genocide I am wreaking on them . <p> I live in Glasgow in a tenement flat and for about three years noticed more and more clothes moths flying about , larvae on my clothes etc . I tried lots of things like sprays , phermone traps etc . In the end I lifted the carpet and put hardboard over the floorboards right up under the skirting board and sealed it round with silicone . I put tape along the joins on the hardboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls low down and I figured they were breeding in the floor space under the boards . I 'm so pleased as I have n't seen any moths last summer or this year so far . <p> Agh I 'm back again cos the case bearers are back again ! We are moving out this month and hoping they do n't  come with us . Only seem to be on the carpet outskirts rather than on anything . As my post stated above I did kill them all off with the powder and spray , but after I did that and noticed for a few months I had not seen any I stopped any treatment and cleaned up the powder underneath the carpet etc but now they have come back so I am going to re-spray and re-powder everything again . I rent this house and it has just been sold to an elderly couple . Not sure if I will be mentioning the infestation to them or not . @***Iv*** Yes your carpet has wool in it if they are eating it . Rip up the carpets and opt for something with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spray and powder for the moths here ( rented house ) and not told the landlord/agent about the infestation because we have been due to move out and someone is buying the house so no point in even reporting it as they wont change the carpet as been sold . I have read up on rights as a tenent though and can confirm as quoted : Landlords , including Housing Associations ( RSLs ) are responsible for dealing with pest problems ( including rats , mice , cockroaches , bedbugs , textile moths , pigeons , tropical ant species and garden ants ) in or on their property. <p> Oh lordy kind of wish i had n't  found this site ! ! ! I have noticed little clothes moths in our bedrooms for a few years now . It was only when i noticed holes in clothes I thought i better start killling them . I had n't  even thought about larvae and infestations . Am off now to start hoovering ! ! i have rooms I dontusem , need to start moving furniture and putting clothes away rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will favourite this page and keep in tough ! ! All my carpet is the very expensive 80/20 wool , i saved for years to have the house carpetted the same all over . I will not let moths eat it ! ! ! <p> My moth problem started in the first spring after I moved in5 years ago . <p> The first thing I spotted was one or two moths on my one quality coat in the understairs cupboard . I bought the devices you hang in wardrobes which have been impregnated with chemicals and this seems to have protected the coats for the last 4 years or so and kept the daily moth count down . <p> My house is quite cool and from observation I have concluded that the eggs can last a long time and usually start hatching in spring They were in the only carpet in the house , the stair carpet . I tried spraying it but even after repeated sprays over the years I still had to do a moth check every day and pinch them off binning the dead body instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up last week , chucking it straight out , using spray in the gaps between steps and hoovering , taking care to empty the hoover out ( outside ) immediately to avoid any sucked up eggs hatching or being released . I should have done it sooner , very theraputic and the stairs will look good and be so much easier to clean once I 've filled the cracks and painted them . Moth GCHQ destroyedthough I 'm sure that wont be the end of it but it will certainly help ! <p> I entirely agree with the other people who have written that its important not to be driven crazy and just try to keep moth numbers down and adopt a liveable , damage limitation approach . To me this has been : Use the chemically impregnated things in wardrobes and replace regularly . Keep clothing such as woollen jumpers etc , tops , scarfs in clear plastic storage containers with fitting lids . Moths hate the light and depending upon how and where you put them they are not much different to drawers . Never leave your best quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I discovered when the larvae destroyed my fav skirt which ironically I 'd only left out to repair ! If you own the place and are debating getting rid of the carpet , do it ! Keep an eye out for any live moths you see on the walls in the morning or evening . My ceiings are quite high and the sight of squashed moths is not particularly appealing ( plus the concern that they may be carrying eggs ) . The thing I find handy is a self made tool a long piece of wood with some masking tape wrapped , stcky side out , round the end . Only takes a second and gone with no marks , with the added bonus that you can dispose of the body and any more eggs it may be carrying . I hate using chemicals but I do spray occasionally . Quarantene keep all internal doors shut to contain any new outbreaks . <p> I have often wondered about the smoke fumigation approach but was a bit concerned that it might spark and set fireprobably a daft concern . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark from one as they retreat ? <p> The antpowder idea sounds good too for particular areas . <p> Oh and one last thing , I saw a few messages which were asking if anything else could be eating carpets and/or clothing . The answer is yes , the carpet beetle . They are a bit smaller than a ladybird and a similar shape , but are dull black with some v dull slightly orangey spots . Like moths , their larva feed on wool or things with keratin , beetles hatching in the spring/early summer which only live a few weeks . All the more reason to ditch the carpet ! <p> At the end of the day its about making it managable . Even if you get rid of every single egg and larvae the world is a living place and it only takes one or two to fly through the windowor arrive with something you bring into the house , so do n't  panic ! 
@@119850998 @8850998/ <p> In the bad old days upgrading anything WordPress related ( plugins , themes , or WordPress itself ) would at best involve manually downloading a zip , extracting it locally and then using FTP to upload the changes to your web server . At worst it could require manually editing files , and making database changes . <p> In February last year I wrote about how cool it was that the All in One SEO Plugin had a one-click upgrade facility . Updating plugins had always been a big pain , especially when you have a blog with many plugins ( this one has about 10 ) so it was great when WordPress introduced one-click plugin upgrade support . Although plugins could now be upgraded with a single click , upgrading WordPress itself was still a manual task . <p> In WordPress 2.7 they introduced one click upgrade support of WordPress itself . When 2.8.0 was released a message at the top of my blog console prompted me to do a one-click upgrade . I decided to wait . Upgrading to a x.x.0 release can be risky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiting until the x.x.1 release can be safer unless there is an urgent reason to upgrade ( such as a critical security update ) . <p> Another reason for delaying a WordPress upgrade is that it can take a while for the plugins that you use to be updated to be compatible with the new version . Sometime no changes are needed , but when WordPress update their database structure , plugins are particularly vulnerable to breaking . <p> Even though you can now upgrade from 2.7. x to 2.8. x with one click , upgrading is never that simple . With each upgrade there is a chance that you will completely trash your blog . <p> Firstly make sure you have plenty of time . If it goes well it shouldnt take too long . What you do n't  want to do is for it to go badly wrong and end up with your blog trashed , just before you have to leave for an urgent appointment . <p> You MUST do your backups before upgrading . Before backing up I make sure all the plugins are up-to-date and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I always do three different backups . <p> File backup I FTP all the blog files down to my computer . <p> XML export Export all the blog information as an XML file using the Tools-&gt;Export option . <p> MySQL database backup A full MySQL database backup using the backup instructions from the official WordPress website . On 1and1 you select the MySQL admin panel using the highlighted button shown below . <p> After backing up I verify that the backups look correct . I generally diff the XML and database dump to my previous backup using the Beyond Compare tool . The main thing to check is that the backups havent been truncated due to a failed download . If the files are much smaller than previous backups then you may have a problem . <p> I 'd read that in order for the upgrade to work on 1and1 you need to ensure that your website is processing . php files using PHP5 rather than PHP4 . To ensure this you must have the below line in your . htaccess file in the root of your blog . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one thing left to press the Upgrade button . <p> I pressed it and held my breath . Some messages appeared on the screen and about 10-15 seconds later it said the upgrade had succeeded . At first I thought something must have gone wrong , as it was so quick . I logged back into the blog and saw that it had worked ! <p> The only problem that I found was due to me having made some changes to the default theme . These changes had been overwritten . Luckily due to the file backup that I had made by FTP I was able to restore them in a few minutes . The lesson to learn here is not to change the default theme . You should copy it to a new directory and only change the copied version . If you want to keep any updates to the default theme in sync with your modified theme you may have to manually merge them in , but at least you wo n't lose your theme updates . <p> Congratulations to the implementers of this feature in WordPress .

@@119850999 @8850999/ <p> In the past year I 've stayed at two different Prince Hotels in Tokyo . The Shinagawa Prince Hotel , and the Shinjuku Prince Hotel . <h> Shinagawa Prince Hotel <p> The Shinagawa Prince Hotel is right across the road from Shinagawa Station . A number of lines are accessible from here including the Yamanote Line which loops around central Tokyo stopping at many of the major stops . There is n't much else of significance in the area , so if you stay at this hotel you will have to take the train to wherever you want to go . <p> The hotel is part of a large complex containing several towers , an aquarium , cinema , restaurants and shops . I was staying in the main tower , and had booked a room on a high floor ' . That was defined by Expedia as being on the 28th floor and above . <p> The reception was very smart , and large . It needs to be to handle the thousands of guests who can stay here . <p> The check-in was smooth and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are express lifts for different floor levels so that it does n't take long to reach your room . <p> Here 's the part of the room with a large bed , table and chair . Also note the size of the window . It goes from near the floor to the ceiling . <p> Here is the bed from the other side . Very comfortable by the way ! <p> Both this Prince Hotel , and the Shinjuku Prince Hotel had a system ( green linen service ) whereby if you opted not to have your sheets and towels changed every day they 'd give you vouchers to spend in the hotel shop . You just need to fill in a form , and tell reception . <p> Remember the window ? Here is the view from it . This is looking North East from the main tower . The Tokyo Tower is visible on the left hand side of the photo . One of the best things about these Prince Hotels is the large window , and view it gives . It is definitely worth getting a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see the busy Shinagawa Station . It has loads of different tracks leading to it , and there are trains constantly going in and out of the station . <p> Back to the inside , here is the TV which is by the window . <p> Instead of having a traditional Do Not Disturb ' sign the Shinagawa Prince hotel had a Do Not Disturb ' button . A nice touch and something that I wish the Toyoko Inn hotel chain would do . <p> This is the bathroom , it is fairly standard for hotels in Japan . The fittings looked quite new and the shower pressure was good . <p> Here 's the view from the window at night . Loads of tall towers with their twinkling red lights are visible across Tokyo . <p> On the left is a photo of the main tower , our room was near the top : ) And on the right is the entrance to the hotel . <p> In the hotel complex are Japanese and Italian restaurants , as well as clothes shops and a convenience store right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the cheapest in Tokyo , but if you want a bigger selection you 'll have to travel , as there are n't many other restaurants in this area . <h> Shinjuku Prince Hotel <p> The Shinjuku Prince Hotel is a 6 to 7 minute walk from Shinjuku station and is right opposite the Kabukicho nightlife area . Like the Prince Hotel at Shinagawa the inside is very smart , and the rooms have a giant window . The main difference between the two is the view you get . Again we paid for a room on a high floor which for this hotel meant a 20th floor room ( this hotel is n't as tall as the other one ) . <p> The above photo is looking East towards Kabukicho , and the one below is looking South East over Shinjuku . <p> Here is a final photo of the view at night . The giant red sign is for a pachinko parlour which was across the street . <h> Other facilities <p> And both hotels had very expensive breakfasts available . But fortunately each of them had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy some milk and cereal for breakfast . <p> You wo n't find a coin laundry in either hotel which is a bit of a pain , as the nearest coin laundry to each is about 20 minutes walk away . <h> In conclusion <p> Both hotels are great if you want a comfortable room with a Tokyo view . Both are also very convenient for access to the Yamanote Subway line . I 'd recommend paying extra for the high floor " make sure you get the high floor before booking if that is what you want . 
@@119851000 @8851000/ <p> Two years ago I produced some graphs showing how much you might pay vs how much you 'd get back with two over 50 plans from AXA Sun Life . Today ( Saturday 16th October 2010 ) The Times has included one of these graphs in its paper , so I thought I 'd produce another set of graphs for a different company . This time it is The Post Office . <p> As before I 'll mention that I 'm not a financial advisor , I have no personal connection to these kinds of plans , and I 'm not making any kind of recommendation . All I am doing is turning the numbers for the Post Office Over 50 's Life Cover plan into some graphs . I 've done my best to make these graphs accurate , but if you spot any problems leave me a comment . <p> I got a quote for a 65 year male using their website based on paying in -7 per month . Using these figures will get you a fixed -892 lump sum ( or rather your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump sum if you die after the first 12 months . If you die in the first year you get your premiums back . Your payments stop after 20 years when you are 85 , and there is no cash in value . So if you stop making payments you get nothing back . <p> There are some other terms which affect the plan : if you die in an accident within the first 12 months you get your full premium back , and if you die of an accident after the first 12 months you get double your premiums back . I am not taking these additional terms into account for my graphs , but of course you might take them into account if considering a policy like this . <p> That is a rough summary in words " but what does it look like when turned into a graph ? <p> The pink line is the lump sum payable which remains fixed , and the blue line is what you pay in . This remains fixed until you have paid in for 20 years . This person starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan once they reach 76 years old . <p> It can be useful to compare the figures against what you 'd get if you put the money into a bank account . This graph has two additional lines . One for saving this amount monthly at 2% , and the other at 4% . <p> These plans are all to do with when you die . Obviously the companies selling these plans have to make a profit ( you do n't think anyone would give you free money do you ? ) , so they use the average life expectance to work out how much life cover to give you . <p> Some people will get more than they paid in , but as with all other kinds of insurance the company has to make more money back . If the companies who make these policies paid out more than you gave them ( on average ) then they 'd go out of business . <p> The National Statistics Office produce tables of life expectancy information . By looking at the Great Britain , Interim Life Tables , 1980-82 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male has a life expectancy of another 17.61 years . This means a man who is now 65 years old will die when he is 82.61 years old ( on average of course ) . <p> Here are the above two graphs again , but this time with a smaller scale . Instead of being from 65 to 100 years , they are from 65 to 85 years . <p> Again as I mentioned above these kind of plans do offer other benefits such as accident insurance , so you have to make up your mind using all the available information . <p> But I hope you can see that a little bit of work in Excel can make the numbers a lot easier to understand . 
@@119851002 @8851002/ <h> Related <p> M&amp;M sorting machines are a popular project for people who like combining electronics , programming and machine building . I decided I 'd try to make my own version but with a different approach to the majority of existing M&amp;M ( or Skittles / Smarties ! ) sorting machines out there . <p> Most of them send a single M&amp;M down a chute to a simple colour sensor where the colour sensor will then take a second or two to figure out the colour . A servo motor will then rotate a chute that will direct the M&amp;M into the correct pot . <p> My approach sends M&amp;Ms down a chute to start with . But I do n't stop the M&amp;M for colour recognition . Instead I use an iPhone to capture the colour of the M&amp;M as it is in freefall . As it is still falling the iPhone talks to a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino and that fires off the correct electro magnet controlled gate . This sends the M&amp;M into the correct pot . Even though this is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and path that the M&amp;M takes down the chute is decided and determined whilst the M&amp;M is moving under gravity . Here 's a video of the prototype : <h> Initial M&amp;M sorting ideas <p> I 'd been thinking about making an M&amp;M sorter for a while as a fun project so I could play around with an Arduino . But I did n't want to stop the M&amp;M for colour recognition or use a servo motor to direct the M&amp;M as these approaches seemed slow to me . <p> It was this video of a high speed coin counting machine that got me thinking about some kind of binary gate that would deflect the M&amp;Ms into the correct place . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=2GGKYHf8DQo . What they 've done is really cool and impressive " the coins zoom through a sensor faster than you can see , and are nudged down the correct path by a pop up nodule . <h> M&amp;M dispenser <p> Starting from the top of the machine I had to figure out how to release ' the M&amp;Ms one by one . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would shoot M&amp;Ms down a tube in the style of the coin sorter video I saw . It did kind of shoot them down the tube , but mostly it sent the M&amp;Ms flying all around my living room . I still do n't know if I 've found them all ! <p> The problem here was making the M&amp;Ms come out one at a time ( they often came out in bunches ) , and the fact that they flew out at different angles and velocities " this would lead to them bouncing around which would make it hard to predict where they were going to go next . <p> I also experimented with a cylinder that the M&amp;Ms would go into first , and then they 'd fall though the holes when the holes lined up . I realised here that the amount of torque I 'd need to rotate these two tubes would be too much for my motors . Plus there was still the problem of the M&amp;Ms falling out in twos . <p> I had more success with trying to replicate this tried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorters . The M&amp;Ms are in the container and they drop into the holes as the holes become empty . <p> The trick to success is to ensure that the height of the hole that the M&amp;M drops into is about the same height as the M&amp;M . This ensures that only one M&amp;M is in the hole at a time . And then as the M&amp;M rotates and approaches the chute it goes under a covered area ( like a bridge which touches the surface of the spinning disk ) which ensures that when the M&amp;M and the hole line up only the M&amp;M in the hole can fall down . <p> The bridge is barely visible in the photo as it is obscured by the sides " it is right at the front and is secured into place with that screw . The piece of foam board on the left perhaps helps to encourage the M&amp;Ms into the hole but may not be necessary . I have the dispenser angled to the back so that the M&amp;Ms fall to the edges ( I want to ensure that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensor <p> I tried to decrease the speed to something sensible using a set of gears that I got from Maplin . However with my crude setup there was so much juddering that it prevented the M&amp;Ms from falling smoothly . <p> So I bought a 12V 80RPM high torque motor from eBay along with a motor speed controller which allowed me to direct drive the spinning disk . It was much smoother now , and this shows that simpler is often better . <h> Electro magnet gates <p> I 'd decide to try deflecting the M&amp;Ms down the correct chute by using electro magnets to control quick reacting gates . Electro magnets can react very fast " much faster than the slow turning of a servo . <p> I first bough a very small low powered electro magnet " it was useless as it was so tiny it would n't have been able to move anything . So I bought a bigger 12V 2A pull magnet from eBaay . This had pulling power ( and goes back to its original position when the power is off because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull ' gate . Here the pulling of the magnet would close the gate . <p> I tried doing this with both the magnet on the same level as the chute ( above ) and also below the chute ( below ) . <p> The problem was that the magnet only pulls 1cm , and taking the diagonal into account that does not fully close the chute . It worked a lot of the time , but sometimes an M&amp;M would slip past the gate . As I could n't find electro magnets with a larger pull length ( one with 2-3cm would have made all this much simpler ! ) I went for a chop ' gate instead . <p> As the electro magnet pulls back the gate chops ' downwards by means of 3 pivot points . This design turns the small amount of electro magnet movement into something much larger which can cover the entire width of the chute diagonally . <p> The difficulty is figuring out the exact shape and size of the moving parts . I did n't have any scientific way of doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard as shown in the image on the right . Then using rigid plastic sheet that I bought from a hobby shop . On the left is the final design I went for . These gates react extremely fast , and make quite a bang as the plastic hits the bottom of the chute . <p> I had to make 5 of them and here is what they were looking like when glued ( using a glue gun ) onto the foam board . I added a bit of black tape ( which was loose at the bottom ) to slightly muffle the sound . <h> Colour sorting of M&amp;Ms <p> I knew that I was going to use an Arduino to control the M&amp;M sorter so it seemed natural to buy the Arduino compatible colour sensor that most of the other projects were using . The colour sensor is in the photo on the left and is the thing that the bright white light is coming from . What I discovered though using it was that the sensor is very slow . You have to individually sample the 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and then figure out the colour . This is n't as easy as the sensors are n't calibrated with each other , so you need to figure out the calibration first . <p> I abandoned the colour sensor as too slow ( I can see why the designs that use this sensor have to stop the M&amp;M to figure out the colour now ) and decided to use an iPhone 5S camera instead . The iPhone 's camera and CPU was fast enough to film the M&amp;M in free fall and 1 ) spot that there was an M&amp;M in the field of view and 2 ) figure out what colour it was . The traditional cheap colour sensors available for the Arduino would n't have even been able to detect that an M&amp;M was even there as it wizzed past in freefall . <p> The camera is placed a bit back from the chute to give it a wider field of view . And for efficiency it is only processing the vertical strip of pixels that make up the chute . No need to process the parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought a Bluetooth LE module for the Arduino ( shown in red above ) so that the iPhone could talk to the Arduino . <p> To make determining the colour more simple I flattened the colour palette of the video images as they came in . I made it so the software only saw the colours of the M&amp;Ms that I was interested in seeing ( so no shadows which were a big problem ! ) and everything else was white . It was then simply a matter of counting the number of coloured pixels , and then if the number was above a threshold sending the Bluetooth command to the Arduino . <p> Here you can see the Bluetooth board plugged into the Arduino and wired up to the relay . Wires are then heading out of the relay to the electro magnets . <h> Putting the M&amp;M machine together <p> Once the three key problems of the 1 ) M&amp;M dispenser , 2 ) electro magnet gates and the 3 ) colour recognition were solved it is just a matter of putting it all together . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot glue gun . <p> I used a sharp hobby knife to cut the foam board , and bought a cutting compass so that I could cut neat circles for the dispenser . <p> As I started testing various bits together I did find a few problems . <p> The M&amp;Ms would ricochet about as they fell down the chute , sometimes ricocheting down the wrong chute before they had reached their gate . I kind-of solved this by putting the chute at an angle so the M&amp;Ms would be encouraged ' to stay on the smooth side of the chute . <p> The electro magnets could get very hot if left on . So hot in fact they could melt the glue that was holding them in place . I had to modify the software to disengage the magnets after they 'd been fired ( but after the M&amp;M had hit ) rather than leaving them in the engaged position . <p> Here 's a side view of the assembled prototype . <p> And here is the front view . It differs slightly from the version in the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store more M&amp;Ms and I added a button to turn the motor on/off at the top as well as a speed dial for the motor . <h> Future improvement ideas <p> I think there is a lot of potential for improving on this design . I think with some improvements the speed and accuracy of the M&amp;M sorting could be better . <p> Try to get rid of the whole iPhone / Bluetooth setup . I think to do this you could try using a Raspberry Pi with a high speed ( 60/120FPS ) capable camera directly attached . The Pi probably has the processing power to do the image processing . <p> At the moment there are three power supplies " one for the Arduino , one for the electro magnets , and one for the motor . It would be great to get everything running off a single power supply . <p> More work on the image processing " you may have noticed I was n't sorting brown M&amp;Ms . They are a pain to distinguish from orange and shadow . Obviously it can be done but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some LED lighting on the chute to reduce the effect of the shadows . <p> 3D printing of the parts " my prototype is very rough " it would be amazing to see it as a smooth 3D printed consumer unit . <p> Currently the gates are in a line " this causes slight timing issues " there is less time between the camera recognising the M&amp;M colour and the first gate needing to fire than the last gate needing to fire . NES4Life came up with the suggestion of having all the chutes arranged in circle ( like a flower ) and then have the chutes move into the centre at the correct time . This would mean a fairly constant time between colour recognition and firing the electro magnet which could simplify things , especially if the speeds get higher . I did a quick test of the concept ( below ) and I think it has potential but I have n't figured out exactly how to do it . <h> Some of the items I bought for the M&amp;M machine <p> Here a partial list of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember ! <p> Various power supplies ( which I wo n't give links to as the ones I got were really dodgy ones that I 'm sure were n't properly safety tested ! ) <p> DC 12V 2A Push Pull Type Open Frame Solenoid Electromagnet 10mm 20N 4.4LB * 5 " -5 each , the ones I bough are listed on eBay not but there from the same seller but are loads of other identical ones on the site <p> 12V 80RPM motor from eBay -6.30 <p> Motor mounts for attaching the motor to the spinning dispenser disk . <p> You could have a single chute/tube with the bins around it in a circle . The electromagnets are all attached to the chute and arranged around it such that when one pulls , the chute bends towards the proper bin . If the color is n't recognized , the chute does n't  move and it just falls down the center into a miscellaneous bin . <p> At the end , ALL the sorted bins then dump into miscellaneous and an auger pulls them back to the top to be sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluetooth board plugged to your Arduino .

There is n't much else of significance in the area , so if you stay at this hotel you will have to take the train to wherever you want to go . <p> The hotel is part of a large complex containing several towers , an aquarium , cinema , restaurants and shops . I was staying in the main tower , and had booked a room on a high floor ' . That was defined by Expedia as being on the 28th floor and above . <p> The reception was very smart , and large .

Very comfortable by the way ! <p> Both this Prince Hotel , and the Shinjuku Prince Hotel had a system ( green linen service ) whereby if you opted not to have your sheets and towels changed every day they 'd give you vouchers to spend in the hotel shop . You just need to fill in a form , and tell reception . <p> Remember the window ? Here is the view from it . This is looking North East from the main tower .

A nice touch and something that I wish the Toyoko Inn hotel chain would do . <p> This is the bathroom , it is fairly standard for hotels in Japan . The fittings looked quite new and the shower pressure was good . <p> Here 's the view from the window at night . Loads of tall towers with their twinkling red lights are visible across Tokyo . <p> On the left is a photo of the main tower , our room was near the top : ) And on the right is the entrance to the hotel . <p> In the hotel complex are Japanese and Italian restaurants , as well as clothes shops and a convenience store right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the cheapest in Tokyo , but if you want a bigger selection you 'll have to travel , as there are n't many other restaurants in this area . <h> Shinjuku Prince Hotel <p> The Shinjuku Prince Hotel is a 6 to 7 minute walk from Shinjuku station and is right opposite the Kabukicho nightlife area . Like the Prince Hotel at Shinagawa the inside is very smart , and the rooms have a giant window . The main difference between the two is the view you get . Again we paid for a room on a high floor which for this hotel meant a 20th floor room ( this hotel is n't as tall as the other one ) . <p> The above photo is looking East towards Kabukicho , and the one below is looking South East over Shinjuku . <p> Here is a final photo of the view at night .

This time it is The Post Office . <p> As before I 'll mention that I 'm not a financial advisor , I have no personal connection to these kinds of plans , and I 'm not making any kind of recommendation . All I am doing is turning the numbers for the Post Office Over 50 's Life Cover plan into some graphs . I 've done my best to make these graphs accurate , but if you spot any problems leave me a comment . <p> I got a quote for a 65 year male using their website based on paying in -7 per month .

I am not taking these additional terms into account for my graphs , but of course you might take them into account if considering a policy like this . <p> That is a rough summary in words " but what does it look like when turned into a graph ? <p> The pink line is the lump sum payable which remains fixed , and the blue line is what you pay in .

Obviously the companies selling these plans have to make a profit ( you do n't think anyone would give you free money do you ? ) , so they use the average life expectance to work out how much life cover to give you . <p> Some people will get more than they paid in , but as with all other kinds of insurance the company has to make more money back .

For my private physiotherapy I 've dealt with both BUPA and Cigna . <p> NHS vs private physiotherapy <p> If you need physiotherapy you have two basic choices , you can either try to get it for free on the NHS or you can go private . If you go private you 'll either have to pay for it yourself or if your private medical cover it may be possible to get them to pay for it . <p> Referral letter <p> Getting NHS physio will in the first instance require a visit to your doctor / GP . You 'll need to get a referral from them for a course of treatment .

They may well fob you off by saying something like you should rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight etc . They may be valid points but if your problem is long standing then seeing an expert is probably the best solution . Often the best way to get what you want from your GP is just to be clear " explain that you have a problem and ask if you can see an NHS physiotherapist . <p> If you want to see a physio via your private health insurance then the procedure is usually very similar " but will depend on how your private health insurance company operates . Many of them will require a doctor 's referral as well . In this case you 'll have to ask your doctor for a private referral letter . You can just ask them for this . As giving you a private referral does n't  result in any cost for the NHS they should happily write the letter for you . <p> If you want to pay for private physio yourself then it is generally not necessary to see a doctor . You can book your appointment straight with the physio clinic . <p> Making the appointment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment . Your referral letter should tell you who to call to do this . One of the disadvantages with NHS physio is that there will be a waiting list . It could be a number of weeks or even months before your appointment date . <p> Making a private appointment with health insurance will require you to get approval from your health insurance company before booking your physio appointment . However as your health insurance company may need the name of the physio company that you are using ( to check that they deal with them ) , you should check with the physio company first to make sure they will treat you , and that they can charge your health insurance company for your treatment . <p> The policies that I 've had with both BUPA and Cigna mandated calling them to get authorisation before booking the physio . On calling them they ask basic questions such as why you want physio . As long as they are happy with your answers they will approve a course of treatment . <p> The first time I used BUPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUPA authorised treatment up to a value of -1000 . They gave me an authorisation code which they said was valid for six months . This authorisation is needed by your physiotherapist in order to claim back the costs of your treatment . When I used BUPA again several years later they gave me another code for treatment " but this time valid for treatment up to the value of -2000 ! <p> Cigna was quite different . My company was using a managed health care ' plan . This meant that Cigna would keep a tight control over the amount of treatment they would give me . Again , once they were satisfied they gave me an authorisation code . With my Cigna plan it was only valid for 6 sessions . There did n't seem to be any maximum cost associated with it but I checked that the amount that my physio was charging was acceptable . <p> After my initial 6 sessions were used up Cigna authorised a further 4 .

Here 's a quick guide , with photos , of how I upgraded the memory of mine . <p> First you 'll need to buy a 2GB RAM module " they are n't expensive and you can buy them from computer shops or online . You need to be careful to make sure you get the right type . You 'll need a 2GB DDR2 SDRAM at 800 MHz such as this <p> Make sure you back up any important work first in case it all goes wrong . If you manage to fry your original memory module and the new memory module then you wo n't be able to boot up the N140 ! <p> Shut down computer fully do n't  hibernate or put it on standby otherwise it may get confused by the extra RAM when it wakes up . <p> Remove the battery . <p> Touch a radiator or other earthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your body . If you have one then wear a static strap that is connected to an earthed object . Static is one of the big killers of RAM so be careful ! <p> Remove the screw on the memory cover on the base of the N140 . Then you 'll have to pull the cover off I had to apply a bit of force to get it to open . <p> Pull the clips outwards and the old RAM should click up . <p> Remove the old RAM . <p> Carefully insert the new RAM into the socket and make sure it clicks back down into place . <p> Put the memory cover back on , re-insert the battery and turn on . <p> Hold your breath ! Hopefully it works and you should see 2GB ( or more probably 1.99GB ) listed in the System Properties page . You can hold the Start key , Fn key and Pause/Brk to bring up the System Properties page . If it does n't then re-open the memory cover and make sure that the memory is correctly plugged in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can always plug the old memory back in . <p> If you like this post please consider linking to it using this code : <h> Related 213587 @qwx1073587 <h> 21 Responses to " Upgrading Samsung N140 RAM to 2GB " <p> I am planning on buying the saumsung n140 and upgrading the ram based on your instructions . I have one question though , does this violate the 1year technical warantee . If you do n't  know I 'll ask at the shop when I buy it . Thanks very much , <p> I have purchased a n140 and also purchased the extra RAM , but made the mistake of buying 667Mhz . This does effect performance and on boot can be slower than the 1 GB . I have removed this and purchased the 800Mhz now . Idiot , I know . do n't  make my expension mistake . <p> I purchased crucial RAM -40 delivered . Kingston also do a similar price RAM module , amazon is always competative . Worth just checking pricerunner.co.uk <p> There is no way to add 4gb of RAM to the Samsung N140. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think you can add an SSD but this is not a supported upgrade . You would have to open the whole case up , which would void the warranty . And you 'd be on your own in terms of getting it configured and working . <p> Hi , they were trying to put a 2gb ram in Kingston make . It was causing problems when they tried to start it up . I decided to leave it . However might take it elsewhere . Just seems to be running very slow . Checked it out all hardware is fine . Can you tell me if I increase the ram will it make much of a difference to the speed of the netbook . To be honest am disappointed at how slow it is . Thanks Paddy <p> More RAM will make it run smoother especially when multi-tasking . This is largely because more RAM will reduce the amount of swap file thrashing that goes on . <p> However it will not make it run fast . This is a netbook , it is n't a full power laptop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full speed computer . I have however found my N140 to be great for emailing , and some light web browsing on holiday . I 've even managed to update my website occasionally using it . <p> So , Sammy N140 has just one RAM slot ? I assume many netbooks , for reasons based on space , have just one RAM slot , which is a shame Having to buy a 2GB stick to upgrade the RAM , instead of just buying and adding a 1GB stick , which could be also performance-wise if they could work in dual channel mode but it seems netbook manufacturers do n't  think too much about consumers <p> Hi Sam , I have n't noticed any decrease in battery life . But then I ca n't claim to have scientifically measured it . On the one hand there is more memory for the N140 to power up , but on the other it will need to access the hard disk less . So I cant imagine that it would make much difference overall . <p> Hi Gilo , That memory you have linked to looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no expert thought ! I 'd guess there are three main possibilities : <p> 1 . Either you did n't  install the RAM correctly into the Samsung N140 you could try again and make sure it is fully pushed in. 2 . The new RAM you have is damaged . In which case you 'll have to get a replacement . 3 . It is the wrong type of RAM . Youd have to find someone who knows more about these things than me to verify this . <p> Just as a quick postscript to my problem . I contacted the supplier ( Avides Media AG via Amazon.co.uk ) and told them the module did n't  work . They refunded me immediately and told me there was no need to return the item ( Thats German effeciency for you ) ! <p> So I then purchased a Lexar Cucial module , it came next day , I installed it , and it worked ( although no notable difference so far haha ) . Here is the link : <p> I just bought an NP-N145 JPO2 ( probably N140 upgrade ) Samsung netbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory but I just do n't  which one to buy . I have a DDR3 but there are many kinds out there : DDR3 PC3 12800 DDR3 1600 DDR3 PC3 10600 DDR3 1333 DDR3 PC3 8500 DDR3 1066 DDR3 PC3 14900 DDR3 14900 DDR3 PC3 16000 DDR3 2000 DDR3 PC3 17000 DDR3 2133 and what is the difference between 204 pins and 240 pins besides its size ? <p> go to crucial and scan you computer tells you what ram you have , what is the most ram lappy can take then copy and paste the ram details and do a google search . sometimes you can find it cheaper , as i very often do <p> I 've had my Samsung N140 for nearly 2 years now . Very happy with it , but it is annoyingly slow at times ( especially web browsing ) , so I 'm thinking of upgrading the RAM now . Thanks for the guide now I know that it can be uprgraded to at least 2GB . <p> I wonder if there is any way ( some bios alterations or upgrades ) that can allow 4GB upgrade ? 
@@119851020 @8851020/ <p> If you want to know what the current value of your house , flat or property is ( useful if you are buying , selling , or extending the leasehold for example ) you can go for the easy option of asking an estate agent to do a valuation , or use a tool such as Nationwide 's house price calculator . Both have their disadvantages ; the estate agent will almost certainly try to sell you an overly inflated figure to get your business , and an online tool such as the one from nationwide bases the prices on a very wide region ( e.g. Greater London ) . <p> If you live in an area with lots of similar properties ( e.g. a block of flats , or a street with very similar houses ) and are good at Excel you can produce a localised graph of property prices over time . The scatter graph below is of the prices of flats for one specific street in London . The red line is the Nationwide regional data for flats in Greater London . Based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess as to the value of yours . <p> I 'm going to assume you have a reasonable amount of Excel knowledge " this is *not* a step by step guide . To follow this you need to know how to import data into Excel , produce graphs , add new data to existing graphs , and format/sort data . <p> To start with you 'll need historical property sale prices . There are lots of websites that you can get them from , but www.houseprices.co.uk gives you them in a form that is easy to import into Excel . <p> Try searching by postcode and by street name to get the relevant prices for your block of flats or street . I 'd suggest setting the number of results to 100 so the data is n't too broken up by their adverts . <p> Copy and paste the prices tables ( there will be multiple tables split by ads ) into your Excel sale prices spreadsheet one after the other . <p> This produces a basic date vs price graph . If you select from the first date / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess which way round the X and Y axis should be . If you include the column names in the selection Excel gets it wrong . <p> If you want to compare against regional data like I did , go to Nationwide 's house price data download page . I chose the Regional Series ' / Flats ( Post 91 ) ' as the best match for the actual property price data I had . <p> The Nationwide spreadsheet data looks like this with prices by quarter and region . <p> Unfortunately Excel does n't understand the date formats in this spreadsheet ( e.g. Q2 2009 ) so I used Find and Replace to change the Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 values into dates . E.g. I changed Q1 into 01/01 ' . Note that I used the find and replace to remove the extra space . <p> Then I marked the column data format as being in date ' format . <p> I then copied the Nationwide data into a separate area of my original property sale prices spreadsheet . The data from the Nationwide spreadsheet is in chronological order , whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore sorted the Nationwide data to be in reverse chronological order as well so that it could be easily added to the same graph . <p> Finally I added a new data series to my original graph by selecting the Nationwide dates for the X axis and the prices for the Y axis . <p> And this is of course the result ( I did a bit of tidying / formatting of the graph to make it look better ) , which will look familiar as being the graph at the start of this post . <p> It ca n't predict the future , but you can make some useful assumptions based on past property prices . And it can give you a good indication if your estate agent is over inflating his/her estimate .

If you too have a website which is of a similar size you might be interested in just how wrong Alexa 's statistics can be . Here is Alexa 's estimate as to how the number of page views I 'm getting has changed in the last three months ( snapshots all taken on the 15th July ) . <p> Looks pretty amazing right ? A 2420% increase in page views in three months . But all is not as it seems . Here are my actual page views from Google Analytics ( same three month period ) . You can see the actual figures show a very gentle increase in page views . <p> Alexa operates by sampling data from the people who have installed its toolbar , or who have installed ( or had installed for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Alexa . <p> The percentage of internet users who have Alexa software on their computers is small so the data is subject to anomalies , especially as the website gets smaller . A large website such as Facebook or MySpace probably gets ok results from Alexa as there will be thousands of people browsing these sitse who have the toolbar installed . But the smaller the site , the bigger the potential for the results reported by Alexa to be out of sync with the actual results . <p> Alexa vs Google Analytics page views per person <p> So why the huge reality vs Alexa distortion for my site ? I 'll come to that later . Next let 's looks at another graph . This is how Alexa thinks my page views per person is doing . <p> Pretty impressive ! The page views per person has gone from 1-2 all the way up to 30 pages viewed per user . If that were accurate it would mean that people really love reading what I write ! But unfortunately my blog is n't quite that engaging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at about 1.3 pages . That figure has remained fairly flat over the last three months . <p> Alexa vs Google Analytics visitors per country <p> Here is my final set of figures . This is where Alexa thinks most of my visitors are coming from . <p> You can see from their figures that they think most ( 74% ) of my visitors are in Japan . It is vaguely plausible as I do have quite a few Japan related postings on this site . However it is n't accurate . Here are the real figures . <p> You can see that only 1.4% of my visitors are in Japan . This largest percentage of viewers is actually from the UK ( 44% ) , but Alexa only believes that 4.5% of my viewers come from the UK . <p> So why is Alexa so badly wrong ? <p> What is causing Alexa to be so badly out of sync from reality ? I am pretty sure I 've worked out the reason . I believe that the massive inaccuracies are the result of a single person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely accidentally . But it is interesting that one person could cause the perceived page views of a 600-800 page per day blog to jump 2420% in three months . It is also interesting that one single person could accidentally cause the Alexa traffic rank to jump from about 600,000 to 200,000 in such a short time . And it is impressive that one single person could cause Alexa to think that 74% of visitors are from Japan when in fact only 1.4% of them are . Also that I could cause the average page views per person to go from 1-2 , all the way up to 30ish . <p> How did I ( accidentally ) cause Alexa 's figures to be so wrong ? <p> There is one main cause of this massive misreporting of figures . I installed the Quirk SearchStatus extension for Firefox . This extension add some small items to your status bar at the bottom of the browser . They can show the Google PageRank for the web page you are currently on , and they can show the Alexa traffic rank for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't silently report the statistics . It actually affects the Alexa traffic rank statistics . As you are browsing where you go will now be recorded by Alexa . <p> In my case I spend a lot of time on my own blog . It is WordPress blog so I need to access it to put up new posts , edit posts , check posts , moderate comments , and install/configure new/updated plugins . In a typical day this could easily generate another 30-50 page views of my blog that are reported to Alexa . <p> It would seem that although all my page views are coming from the same IP address , they are still able to make Alexa think that my blog is seeing a huge surge in traffic . <p> The timing is right too . The time I installed the plugin matches the time I started seeing this huge surge in Alexa rankings . And that 's not all . A short while after installing the plugin I headed to Takamatsu in Japan and continued working on my blog from there . <p> The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexa to think that most of my visitors were now coming from Japan . <p> Almost all of this was caused by me accessing my WordPress blog in a normal way whilst having this Firefox extension installed . <p> What it shows is how inaccurate the numbers can be for small sites such as mine . The number of people whose browsers report statistics to Alexa is sufficiently small that a single person can seriously skew the data . <p> So look at Alexa 's statistics if you really want to .

@@119851032 @8851032/ <p> If you want to know what the current value of your house , flat or property is ( useful if you are buying , selling , or extending the leasehold for example ) you can go for the easy option of asking an estate agent to do a valuation , or use a tool such as Nationwide 's house price calculator . Both have their disadvantages ; the estate agent will almost certainly try to sell you an overly inflated figure to get your business , and an online tool such as the one from nationwide bases the prices on a very wide region ( e.g. Greater London ) . <p> If you live in an area with lots of similar properties ( e.g. a block of flats , or a street with very similar houses ) and are good at Excel you can produce a localised graph of property prices over time . The scatter graph below is of the prices of flats for one specific street in London . The red line is the Nationwide regional data for flats in Greater London . Based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess as to the value of yours . <p> I 'm going to assume you have a reasonable amount of Excel knowledge " this is *not* a step by step guide . To follow this you need to know how to import data into Excel , produce graphs , add new data to existing graphs , and format/sort data . <p> To start with you 'll need historical property sale prices . There are lots of websites that you can get them from , but www.houseprices.co.uk gives you them in a form that is easy to import into Excel . <p> Try searching by postcode and by street name to get the relevant prices for your block of flats or street . I 'd suggest setting the number of results to 100 so the data is n't too broken up by their adverts . <p> Copy and paste the prices tables ( there will be multiple tables split by ads ) into your Excel sale prices spreadsheet one after the other . <p> This produces a basic date vs price graph . If you select from the first date / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess which way round the X and Y axis should be . If you include the column names in the selection Excel gets it wrong . <p> If you want to compare against regional data like I did , go to Nationwide 's house price data download page . I chose the Regional Series ' / Flats ( Post 91 ) ' as the best match for the actual property price data I had . <p> The Nationwide spreadsheet data looks like this with prices by quarter and region . <p> Unfortunately Excel does n't understand the date formats in this spreadsheet ( e.g. Q2 2009 ) so I used Find and Replace to change the Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 values into dates . E.g. I changed Q1 into 01/01 ' . Note that I used the find and replace to remove the extra space . <p> Then I marked the column data format as being in date ' format . <p> I then copied the Nationwide data into a separate area of my original property sale prices spreadsheet . The data from the Nationwide spreadsheet is in chronological order , whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore sorted the Nationwide data to be in reverse chronological order as well so that it could be easily added to the same graph . <p> Finally I added a new data series to my original graph by selecting the Nationwide dates for the X axis and the prices for the Y axis . <p> And this is of course the result ( I did a bit of tidying / formatting of the graph to make it look better ) , which will look familiar as being the graph at the start of this post . <p> It ca n't predict the future , but you can make some useful assumptions based on past property prices . And it can give you a good indication if your estate agent is over inflating his/her estimate .

@@119851043 @8851043/ <p> Ive been having problems with my knees for many years . I get pain when I am in a seated position . I do a desk job which means I am in pain for much of the day . Sitting in a cinema , restaurant or car will cause me pain as well . I do n't  have pain when I 'm standing , walking , lying down or exercising . The pain is mostly in my right knee coming from the area under the knee cap but there is also some pain in my left knee . <p> Physiotherapy <p> I first had physio on the NHS about 7 years ago and have since had multiple courses of private physiotherapy as well . If you have read my nhs vs private physio post you 'll know what the differences are with between NHS and private treatment . In total Ive seen four different physiotherapists . <p> My first physiotherapist diagnosed the problem as patellofemoral pain syndrome , and all the other physios Ive seen have used the same name for the problem . Patellofemoral pain syndrome is not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic name that means knee pain . Pretty useless really ! I know I have knee pain and giving it a fancy name does not help ! <p> What is important for your physio to do is to properly diagnose why you have pain in your knee . There is a very good guide to patellofemoral pain on the KNEEguru website which also contains detailed information on all kinds of knee related issues . Before having a course of physiotherapy it is worth reading about the basic anatomy of the knee and the leg . If you know some of the names of the bones , muscles , and how the knee joint works you 'll be better placed to understand what you physiotherapist tells you . <p> In my case the physios have always believed that my knee cap ( patella ) is in the wrong position . It is not centred in the patellar groove which causes more pressure to be put on one side than the other . The pain comes on when I sit down because in this position the knee cap is pulled into the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My treatment has consisted of four main part . <p> 1 . Stretching the outer muscles of my leg <p> In my case the outer muscles and connective tissues of my right leg are tight . This has the effect of pulling my knee cap away from the centre of the groove . By stretching these muscles the pull on the knee cap should slowly reduce . <p> 2 . Strengthening the inner muscles of my leg <p> I was given exercises to strengthen the inner quad muscles of the leg . By strengthening these muscles the knee cap should be pulled towards its correct position . <p> 3 . Deep tissue massage <p> A painful type of massage was carried out on my outer thigh to try to stretch out the muscles and other connective tissues . This helps to reduce the pulling forces on the knee cap . <p> 4 . Taping of the knee cap <p> The stretching and strengthening exercises slowly help to reposition the knee cap but a more direct re-positioning effect can be achieved by taping the knee . After assessing the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach surgical tape over the knee to pull it into the correct position . For me the taping had an almost immediate effect on my knee pain . <p> Orthopaedic consultant <p> My knee pain went up and down over the years and I started new physio courses when my pain got worse . During my last course of physio my knee pain actually got worse which is when my physiotherapist recommended that I see an orthopaedic consultant . <p> Upon visiting the consultant he asked me a few questing and quickly looked at my knee . He said that my knee cap did look like it was further off centre than it should be . He gave two recommendations . <p> He could either have a look at what was going on inside my knee and possibly treat any problem by doing an arthroscopy . An arthroscopy is a keyhole surgery operation where a camera and light source is inserted into the knee through a very small incision . A liquid is pumped into the joint which helps to expand the joint so it easier to see and navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second or third hole to probe or treat any problems . <p> The second option was to send me to have an MRI scan done of my knee after which I might need an arthroscopy to treat any problems found . <p> I picked the MRI scan as there was n't any disadvantage to having it done . It never hurts to have as much information as possible before considering surgery . <p> MRI scan <p> I was told to remove anything metallic from my person and put it in a locker outside the MRI room . I was then taken in and made to lie down on the machines bed . I have one metal crown in my mouth but this was not a problem . <p> The technician secured my leg into place and gave me some headphone to wear . She asked what kind of music I wanted to listed to . She suggested pop , and I was fine with that . I was given a button which I could press if I needed to contact her . <p> She then left the room and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said that they were going to start the machine . They started the music as well . It sounded like an old compilation of really bad pop songs . <p> The machine started up and rumbled into life . It was surprisingly noisy and seemed to vibrate intensely like a piece of industrial machinery . Even with the headphones on your cant ignore the fact that this large machine is roaring around you ! <p> The machines roared for about a minute and then stopped . After about 30 seconds it started roaring again . After a few minutes of this the technician 's voice came back on the headphones . She told me that I was n't keeping my knee completely still . This was annoying as I was keeping it as still as I could . It is hard to remain completely still for so long . If I 'd known how long it would take I would have asked for my leg to be more securely fastened in place . <p> Previously I 'd only had X-Rays taken of my body and anyone who has them taken knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRI scan is more like a very slow exposure . This is because many images are being taken at slices across whatever it is they are scanning . <p> The machine could take 20 images slices through my leg . It can take the images in any direction as well . They took images from top to bottom , left to right , and along my leg . Each time the machine would rumble for about one minute and then stop for about 30 seconds before starting again . <p> The whole process took about 20 minutes during which I had to endure music such as Cyndi Laupers Girls Just Wan na Have Fun . I was glad when it was all over ! <p> Afterwards they told me to wait outside whilst they put my images on a CD . The CD ended up having around 100 images on it from various angles . Some scans had been done several times probably because I had n't  managed to keep as still as they wanted me to . After I 'd been given the CD I was free to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the MRI images and recommendations . <p> Consultant recommendations <p> A week later I went back to see the consultant . He told me that internally the knee looked healthy . The bones and ligaments seemed in good condition . <p> The only problems were that my knee cap was tilted as you can see from the below image , and that my knee cap was higher than it would usually be . <p> He gave two options . Either I could try some further physio now with the extra knowledge of how my knee cap was positioned or he could perform lateral release surgery on my knee . <p> The consultant told me that a lateral release of the patella was a very safe procedure . It would take 30-45 minutes , be done under general anaesthetic , and I 'd be able to walk out of the hospital and go home a few hours later . I should be able to do exercise such as running after a month , I 'd be able to do high impact exercise such as karate two months after the operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that was extremely rare . This appointment lasted less than 15 minutes and this included the time where he was explaining the MRI scans . <p> I told the consultant that I 'd prefer the surgical option as I 'd been having physio for so long . <p> My own research into lateral release surgery <p> When I got home and thought about it more I felt that I did n't  really understand what it was the consultant wanted to do to me knee . This is probably not surprising given that I spent less than 15 minutes with him . I wanted to be able to do my own research to better understand the surgery . <p> I did some research on Google into arthroscopy surgery and lateral release surgery . I phoned up the consultant to confirm the name of the procedure , and that it was the lateral retinaculum which was going to be cut . This at least allowed me to find specific information on the surgery . <p> Lateral release surgery is an operation which is supposed to allow the knee to rest in the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lateral retinaculum is a type of tissue which hold the kneecap on the outer side of the leg . The procedure uses arthroscopy techniques rather than open knee surgery . There is a quick description of the surgery on about.com and there was a really excellent article on arthroscopy surgery on KNEEguru . You 'll still find lots of individual accounts of the surgery on KNEEguru and on Google by using the search boxes . <p> Obviously the internet does not provide a balanced view of the success of surgery . People with bad experiences are much more likely to share than people who have had no problems . Still I was very alarmed by the large number of accounts of people who have said that lateral release surgery has made their knees worse . In some cases people have been saying that this surgery has left them with permanently reduced mobility or in agony . Some people say it has ruined their life . Strong words indeed . Other people talk about the long recovery times to get mobility back up to normal . There are of course people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications . <p> Even if the people who have had complications are just a minority it does show that the surgery can have real complications . I was worried that these complications had n't  been properly explained to me by the consultant . An appointment lasting under 15 minutes is just not sufficient to explain the MRI results , the surgery and the risks . I got an explanation of the MRIs , a very brief description of the surgery and hardly any detail of the risks . <p> I decided to cancel the surgery . Even if the risks are small I did n't  consider it worth risking my mobility for the sake of pain which although can be quite painful is something that I can live with . Especially now that I know the internals of my knee ( bones , ligaments ) are healthy I did n't  want to risk the health of my knee by having surgery . I was also put off by my previous experience of surgery where a simple lipoma/cyst removal surgery turned into 6 weeks of pain and inconvenience . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some pain in my left knee . <p> I decided to continue with the physio . Previously there has always been an element of guess work with the physio as the physiotherapists have always been diagnosing the problems from the outside of the knee without any knowledge of what is going on inside . Now that I have the MRI scans of my knee , and can see more precisely what the problem is I hope that they physio can be better targeted at what the problem is. 213587 @qwx1073587 <p> After reading your blog , I 'm really surprised that you did n't  have the surgery ?

My own experience is very similar to your own . Unlike you , I decided to go through with the lateral release surgery . I thought you might be interested in a brief synopsis of my experience . <p> Me : early 30s , very athletic my entire life , no major trauma to lower extremities , but have experienced pain in left knee for 10+ years . I had surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the procedure . He said there are many things they can see with the arthroscope that he cant see any other way ( such as how tight the lateral reticulum is and how it tracks ) . He ended up doing 3 things : lateral release , chondroplasty ( smoothing the cartilage surface on the underside of the patella ) , and shaving down the medial plica ( a band of tissue that was rubbing against my kneecap ) . <p> My knee , post surgery , was incredibly swollen . I assume this is normal . He expected me to be off crutches within a few days . As I recall it was over a week , I think closer to 2 weeks before I was able to ditch them entirely . Anyway , for the first few weeks it was tough even walking around the house . After that things seemed to be improving . My ROM came back reasonable quickly . I did develop some hip problems ( doc thinks tendinitis ) in my opposite hip that took a month to resolve and slowed down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on track and did strengthening exercises and started increasing time on the bike , swimming pool , walking , etc . <p> Around the 3 month mark my knee was feeling really well : pain was rapidly decreasing , my strength was increasing and I began to actually get complacent about the success . Somewhere around the 4 month mark things started going downhill . I 'm not positive what set it off , but regardless , things were apparently not as good as I thought they were . I started doing some PT work again and re-focused my time on going to the gym to do leg strengthening , stretching , etc . <p> Now I 'm around the 10 month mark and I think knowing what I know now I would not do the procedure . My knee is not improved from where it was pre-surgery . I think in some respects it may actually be slightly worse . The main problem is that despite diligent work in the gym I have still been unable to regain the full VMO strength . Visually my right VMO is larger than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-surgery . I think I may actually have slightly more persistent clicking when I move my leg into full extension and hold it . I also have some occasional clicking from my IT band . I had this several years back and was able to resolve it using the foam roller . I 'm trying frequent foam rolling to resolve it again , but am currently still getting some IT band clicking . <p> My orthopedist said that the lateral release was an unreliable procedure but that I shouldnt be worse off than I was before . My analysis is that I may be slightly worse off than I was before , but it is difficult to say for sure . I had not expected the muscle recovery to be as difficult as it has been . <p> So my conclusion is mixed . I knew when I went into it that it was a risk .

Oh , and my physio is using the kinesology tape and I swear by it for swelling and muscle stimulation although I have better results with it in my other knee which subluxes all the time and is awaiting the same fate as the operated knee ! ! ( which I hope will be private after my medical negliagence case wins ! ! ! ) <p> Thanks for your comment to my post . I 'm curious as to how bad your knee problem was in order for you to be referred to have this surgery ?

I carried on the day as normal and went to work in my restaurant , as I bent down to get something out of the fridge I felt the most excruciating pain in my left knee . It was so painful I was unable to drive home or even take my trousers off to have a look ! ! As I had dislocated my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee . The next day was no better and I was struggling to walk so I went to my local A and E. The doctor disregarded what I thought was wrong , refused to XRay and diagnosed a torn cartilage , he bandaged me from thigh to ankle in crepe and wool ( it looked and felt like a full leg cast ) gave me some crutches and refered me to physio for a week later . <p> The physio immediately referred me to the orthopaedic department who suggested an 8 week course of physio before seeing them again . Neither the physio or orthopaedic consultant questioned the original diagnoses yet the physio was baffled by my symptoms not matching . <p> During those 8 weeks my other knee began to sublux , crunch and grind until it too dislocated . At this point I was given the option of either an arthroscopy or an MRI , as the MRI was less invasive I obviously chose this option however it took a further 10 weeks before I got it . All this time the physio was still treating suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the results of the MRI came back they showed excellent cartiliges but severe patellofemoral dysfunction , basically I was born with my lateral condyles missing and abnormally small patellas in both my knees so my patellas cant sit correctly in their trochlear groves . I was stunned that this had n't  been diagnosed before or that I have no history of knee pain despite all the high impact sport I play . I was told that due to my fitness levels , the muscles surrounding my knees have been holding them in place and that now that I 'm older the muscles are softening up ! ! ( I must admit I still find all of this information very puzzling ! ! ) <p> The surgeon recommended a lateral release in my right knee and if it was successful they would perform the op on my left leg . He gave me a 70% success rate . He gave me no information on the actual procedure , only to say that it was performed in day surgery and that I would be able to return to work between 2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info I had to rely on my physio and the internet to find out more about the procedure . Both scared me witless but as I could find no other alternative or information on my condition and I was still on crutches I felt I had to put my trust in my surgeons judgement . <p> I was given an information sheet about the procedure at my pre admin meeting the week before the op but they had given me information about a different op and not a lateral release ! On the morning of my op I was seen by a physio who again started describing a different op , I was extremely concerned by this point and asked her to check my notes , she apologised for her error and told me that she did n't  have time to discuss my procedure but that I would n't be allowed home without seeing another physio after my op . The registrar then came in and wrote in marker pen " lateral release " on my right knee in huge lettersthank goodness for that ! ! <p> A few hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my thigh which was not previously explained , this had caused me to panic as I could not feel anything from my groin to my toes ! However the surgeon reassured me that everything had gone well . <p> I was given the all clear to go home if I wanted about 6 hours after the op , however as the pain was so great they recommended that I was put on a morphine drip and stay in , the choice was mine . At this point I asked the ward nurse when the physio would be around to see me , to be told that the physio had gone home and that she did n't  feel it was necessary to see me ! ! As I was still lying in blood soaked blankets I decided that I would be far better off at home and left . <p> The next few weeks I can only describe as horrific , I was not warned about how painful it is or how little movement I would have . I could only stay in one position for 10 minutes max and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way to sleep was flat on my back and I woke nearly every hour with the pain . I could n't get in or out of the shower or bath for weeks and had to manually move my leg with my arms to get dressed or in bed etc . <p> When I finally got referred to a physio ( after my own insistance ) 4 weeks later the damage had already been done in regards to leg functionand scar tissue , however there is a significant improvement but not enough to avoid the MUA . <p> At this stage I still do n't  know if the op was a success or appropriate for someone with my condition . <p> I really wish the surgeon had given me more information or at least different options . To me it seems he treated a problem , ie the knee , and not the patient , the NHS really does not treat holistically or give the time for patients to ask questions , I would rather be given a best/worse case scenario so that I could make an informed decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be . <p> As I did not recieve the vital physio after my op its hard for me to say if I would recommend having a lateral release to someone . I hope this post does n't  put other people off the procedure however I can not stress enough this is n't the " walk in the park " type of op the doctors would lead you to believe . It is a big op despite the short length of time it takes to do . It is unreliable and the initial problem could be made worse . It is also extremely painful ( I would n't have minded this if I was pre warned ! ! ) <p> I have my final meeting with the surgeon next week before my MUA . I certainly will be going in there with my list of questions and this time I 'm not going to be bullyed into leaving until I have all the information ! ! ! <p> I just thought I will post this can I ask tess whittaker what a MUA is ? ? <p> I have a lateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old been in pain for 10 years seen 4 different physios the last said I need to see an surgeonI WAS very sporty ( nearly went pro playing football ( am a female ) ) . <p> I also have something very similar to yourself but mine is called hypoplastic medial femoral condyle ( also my condyle is mishapped not by a huge amount but enought to cause problems ) , I also have a patella tilt and it looks like I have some cartilage problems too and I am hypermobile ( joints flex too much ) <p> My surgeon as well as 2 others have suggested this lateral release at an only 30% chance of reducing my pain , because I have seen 2 other surgeons who stated the same thing I am going to go for it as the pain I am in is terribleI have been told this is the only treatment that can help me and there isnt any other surgery that can help . <p> So , basically I have went for it but I agree that surgeons seem to not talk much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I 've entered into a whole new world of doctor terminology ! ! Basically a MUA stands for manipulation under anaesthetic , its a non evasive procedure ( no cuts or stitches ) where they physically manipulate the knee through its full range of movement whilst the patient is asleep ( far too painful otherwise ! ! ) . Due to a large formation of scar tissue around the knee it is now impossible for me to fully bend my knee or to have any quad function so the manipulation is necessary to " tear " the scar tissue apart . As yet I have been given limited info on the procedure ( I see my surgeon in a few days and hope he can spare me more time on this appointment ! ! ) My physio has said that it is painful but gives good results and I 'm at a stage now where I do n't  care what the pain is like in recovery as long as I get a good result ! ! <p> Good luck with your surgery , have you been given any pre op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery plays a small part in fixing the problem , the aftercare is crucial as you will need to retrain your muscles in a very different way to what you have been accustomed to . Be sure to know the time lines for the after care ! ! ! <p> Remember my procedure only went wrong due to the lack of aftercare ( physio ) that I recieved so please do n't  let my story put you off but if you want more info please do n't  hesitate to email me on t4tess at yahoo.co.uk and I 'll be more than happy to help . <p> I 'm 28 years old and i had lateral release on 3 mar 2010 ( nearly a week ago ) when i first started to see a consultant regarding pains in my right knee about 3 years ago , i was sent for nhs physio they were convinced that my pain was caused by lower back problems so they started giving me exercises for my back , after 6 months it was becoming apparent that it was not solving the pains in my knee if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back either ) . <p> During this time i was back and forth to see my consultant to check on my progress as always there was no change . It was then decided that i should have an MRI scan to find out what was going on . <p> After a few weeks i got an appointment to have keyhole surgery , i went for my pre op and was told that basically all that would happen is that i would have 3 or 4 small holes in my knee to fit a camera through and then the surgeon would tidy up my cartlidge and and flush out my knee , to me that sounded simple enough . <p> On the day of my surgery the surgeon came to talk me through the procedure and only then did he tell me that nothing came up on my MRI scan and that is was unlikely that they would find anything doing the keyhole surgery and said that if this was so then they would have to do a lateral release , it was n't really explained but i was told that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leg from my thigh downwards , considering i wasnt told about this procedure until the day and i had been waiting 10 years for something to be done i decided that i should go ahead with it . <p> Now it has been 5 days since my surgery and i have a thick bandage from just above my knee down to my ankle , i have had no pain just stinging now and again but totally bearable , as far as i can see i do n't  have any bruising , as far as swelling goes i cant tell as there is a lot of bandaging. i 'm not taking any painkillers although they were prescribed when i left hospital . Although i cant bend my knee i can still just about walk with out the aid of my crutches ( only around the house ) i 'm resting quite a lot and getting very bored but so far all is well . hopefully i will feel a difference when i am fully healed . <p> Ten yrs ago i was diagnosed with Chondromalacia Patella in both knees . The NHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan . <p> After 4 unsuccesful attempts at physio over a period of 6 years , i requested to see a specialist on the NHS . The specialist reffered me to his assistant for examination , who advised i had cartilage damage and there was no medical procedure that would help me . I was told i could never run again or do high impact sports , and i would have to get used to a new way of life on medication to control the pain and swelling . <p> I tried numerous medication which either did n't  work or i had a bad illergic reaction after 2 weeks into the course ( NSAIDs ) . So i continued to live with the pain for another 3 years . <p> This winter the pain became too much so i requested a referal to see a knee specialist privately . I did n't  expect to actually acheive anything but i thought it would n't hurt getting another opinion . <p> After examination the specialist advised my knee cap tracking was the problem as it was pulled to the outside of the knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week later i was in surgery for arthroscopy and lateral release to my right knee ( 25th Feb ) through private healthcare . The surgery went well , although i did n't  take to well to the anesthetic so i had to stay in hospital a til the evening until i could keep food down . Other than that i was fine other than stiffness in my knee . I left the hospital with crutches . On discharge i was given a physio appointment for 4 days time and some excercises to start the next day , and told to rest as much as possible . <p> 2 weeks after surgery i have attended 3 physio appointments i can bend my leg considerably well although the swelling causes me a few problems at the min but this should go down by 6-8 weeks . I only use one crutch when i need to go out and about as my knee becomes stiff if i do n't  rest it enough and ice it . I have had a very small amount of brusing on my knee , my bruise on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used medication for the pain for 5 days after the op ( tramadol and parecetamol ) and other than a bit of aching its managable . <p> I had my stitches out yesterday and the surgeon showed me the before and after images of inside my knee . before images showed perfect ligament , cartilage and boneonly problem area was where the knee cap tracked incorrectly and the bone had fragmented . This was filed down to give a smooth surface b4 the lateral release . After images showed significant improvement . <p> I will see the surgeon again on April 1st to review , and hopefully get booked in for my left knee 3 weeks after that . <p> All in all i can say so far the op was extremely sucessful and you must put in the effort after the op to get the disired result u do n't  get something for nothing , please commit to your physio excercises after the op , and ensure u are seen by a physio therapist soon after the op . <p> i had a lateral release 2 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute disaster . i would really urge any potential candidate to work at physiotherapy and not pursue a surgical option . for phyio to work , however , it needs a good understanding and lots of hard work in the gym or at home stretching and strengthening . <p> I had this surgery on 4 mar and have had little if any problems at all ! One thing I noticed I did experience that many did not mention is that I began intensive physical therapy the day after surgery and have it for 3x a week for 4-8 weeks . I feel this should make a lot of difference but time will tell ! I was back at work within 1 1/2 weeks ( desk job ) and up and around quite a bit right away . <p> hi i dislocated my kneecap and was going to physical therapy , however it did n't  help i got xrays and an mri but all it showed was subloxation of the knee . i eventually had surgery and i had a torn meniscus that the mri did n't  pick up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst thing for my knee . after the surgery my knee had a snapping in it when i walked and went down the stairs it was horrible and painful . i did more physical therapy but to no avail . i just had another surgery yesterday and the pain is horrible . i asked my doctor what he did and he said he cut a band of tissues in my knee ? ? ? wtf i do n't  think he even knows what he did . its been a messed up experience for me. i think doctors do this procedure for no reason . i hope i make a 100% recovery , because this hinders you from doing alot of things . i am not a happy camper. if your doctor suggest a lateral release please get a second opinion before letting him do it . do n't  be like me. ive been out of work for 7 months and who knows how long this second surgey is going to take . <p> Hello , its so interesting Reading everyones views and experience . I 'm 19 and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accupuncture . I had numerous xray and mris . Now after 2 years and awful pain I 'm due to have another one : s I 'm very tempted to refuse surgery again ad if I was given the right care I would n't be in this situation .. My first op I had done privately , this time I 'm seeing NHS surgeons due to wait on private being longer . Glad its not just me who seems to gave persistent problems .. Does anyone know of other forms to release muscle and sit knee back in to place ? <p> Hi . Yeah they done all 4 things after months of 2 hour physio sessions each week followed by accupuncture they then decided to operate , it seems worse now than what it did previous . Ca n't believe so many others have had same problem . <p> Hi , I read your article about your case with very interest and was pleased with its description . As orthopaedic osteopath here in Finland I can only add that , Yes it is a good rule to go to surgery as a last resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suggest to eventually visit an osteopath or other practitioner able to release an adherent lateral retinaculum . Also a postural and walking checking-up would help to prevent further the situation . Physiotherapy or anyway well executed exercises are always a good healing and fitness procedure . Best wishes . <p> Hi everyone , I am very disappointed and sad at reading most of the comments with bad news about lateral release surgery . I had a motorcycle accident 18 months ago and I was pinning my hopes on this surgery to get my knees back to normal . I am hoping that there are thousands of people who have had successful surgery and have not needed or thought to Google the subject : ) Its great that you have pictures of your knees on CD I saw a quick flash of mine on the specialists computer screen and was told a load of things I did n't  understand there were lots of pockets of fluid around my knees which I assume I still have as they are still swollen . I have had lots of physio and do lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life but if my knees are still swollen , there must be something amiss which needs further attention ? Any comments appreciated , Good luck everyone , our knees are very important X <p> Hi Helen , when I was researching lateral release surgery I did see plenty of positive accounts along with the negative ones . <p> Do n't  forget that people who have negative experiences are likely to be much more vocal in their opinions than the ones who had positive experiences . However as with any surgery , it is good to be informed of the potential risks of the surgery . <p> My orthopaedic consultant made it sound like a completely risk free procedure . <p> Good luck with your treatment , and do post another comment to update us on your progress . Would be good to have more positive accounts on here ! <p> Hi , thanks for your reply . I am seeing another consultant next week . At least I will have a vague idea what he is talking about at the next appointment . I hope to leave positive comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I would give you the courtesy of my update . I saw a specialist who was obsessed with the fact that my accident was part of a claim . His job was clearly to stop the claim and send me on my way . He said if I go to the gym 4-5 times a week I should be back to normal within another 4-5 months . His attitude was awful and made me feel uncomfortable . I had hoped for specialist advice on the health of my knees ! His subsequent report was along the above lines although at the appointment he did say my knees were swollen but omitted this from the report . Anyway , I have noticed that my knees do improve with exercise so I am hoping it is actually not necessary for any surgery , which sounds like it would be a good idea to avoid . I hope I have no future problems with my knees as the specialist seems to think , but I am slightly nervous ! I wish you all the very best of health and luck : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was 15 , I am now nearly 29 and I have had no problems at all with my knee since . The recovery took a few months in total but I am so glad that I had it done . All the problems I had before the surgery completely went away ! All the best to everyone on here and good luck ! : ) x <p> I had a lateral release of the patella this May , and I was back to riding horses 3 to 4 times a week come August 1st After the surgery I took no pain killers and was walking in about 3 days , but I still had a straight knee brace on . The only reason I could n't walk sooner was due to the fact that I had got a nerve block . I did have some swelling but the doctor said it was very normal , and I had great rang o motion the week after . I started physical therapy a week after the surgery and went 2 times a week until the last week in July . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could be the answer to you suffering . <p> I have been suffering with knee problems for 18 years which started whilst i was in the Army . I 've had 3 operations ( keyhole ) to sort out/remove cartlidge and been to physio on God knows how many ocassions . The last time i went ( 11 months ago after my last op ) they said that after 18 years of problems , physio would not help . <p> I 'm due back to see the specialist in a few weeks and my knee is getting worse , not better . The last time i saw him he mentioned lateral release so i will see what he says now . <p> The pain and lack of mobility I suffer is ridiculous for a 39 year old so I 'm willing to try anything . Its funny as today Ive been to see one of the lads i was in the army with as he s just come home from a partial knee replacement . He had the same symptoms and same amount of ops as me but as he is 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . <p> Hi I 'm another one intrigued to read everyone elses horror stories . I 'm a 41 yr old female ex police officer and had my first knee op at only 23 a medial repair , after then I had 6 further ops on both knees , arthroscopys to clear out debria etc . I had my first lateral release in Oct 09 with a private surgeon , this was due to alot of knee pain at the front of my knee and it giving way . It seemed to work and went to all the physio appointments etc , however within 8-9 months I was experiencing pain again in the front lower part of my knee . After seeing one private surgeon who told me to lose weight ( 5ft 9 weighing 11 stone ! ! ! ) and to buy a knee support and to keep applying anti inflammatory gel , i decided to get a second opinion so went back to my orginal surgeon . I hav=d been told by a physion that a second lateral release is very unusual so was not expecting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 11 I found hed done another . I have to say my paid is now worse tahn before the op and this is now four months on . I can hardly walk up and down stairs , I can not walk for more than half a mile without being in extreme pain . I now on tramadol as the GP willnot give me any stronger so have to combine these with paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time . I am now waiting for another MRI as my surgeon does not know why I am in still so much paid and unable to fully weight bear on this leg . If only we had hindsight what a wonderful gift that would be ! ! <p> Hi I just had lateral release done today . I am 51 and was born with knee tracking problems . I had a procedure done back in the 70s that is considered barbaric now and that one I have had eight arthroscopies and now due for knee replacementits trashed . So the right knee was virgin but the tracking got much worse . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . I have been so immobile due to these knee issues I had to do something ! ! <p> I 'm 43 now and have played basketball almost weekly since I was about 15 until I was 39 ; never had any knee problems . I was taking a brisk walk up a very steep hill and felt something move and " click " but never any pain . The following weekend while playing ball I was simply running down the court , had no contact with anyone but my knee collapsed and I fell down . <p> MRI showed deep bone bruise and it hurt like hell . After 3 months it kept collapsing and I could not even get up and down stairs . First Dr. did athroscope , shaved down meniscus and removed some bone chips but did not find anything more . The surgery did absolutely nothing and my kneed continued to get worse . I went through rehab and get several corizone shots but nothing helped . <p> Finally went to get 2nd opinion and x-ray showed spot where I had deep bone bruise had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2nd arthroscope found dead bone in the spot and my patellas was tracking quite laterally , such that in would engage the dead spot and hurt like hell . The area was cleaned up , microfracture was done to restore blood supply and then had lateral release . Post op notes stated the knee cap was tracking so bad , it was the reason all the articular cartilidge was knocked off . <p> I vowed never to play any sports like this again and found after six months knee felt better . Before the surgery , I could not get up a flight of stairs without extreme pain and knee collapsing . Started walking , then jogging 9 holes of golf after work and for almost three years it got stronger and stronger . <p> Five weeks ago I did something foolish . I returned to my old church gym on Saturday morning to play ball again , even though I promised my wife I would not . My knee felt outstanding and I played seven pain free games ; something I never thought to be possible again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week and he took x-ray again . The area where microfracture was performed was completely filled back in and because of lateral release , the patellas was not rubbing that area and back in the track where it was supposed to be . This would have never been possible without the lateral release . Ive played ball 5 weeks straight and never felt better . Every case is unique , but I can tell you it was very successful and gave me back something I thought I had lost forever . <p> I had a lateral release of my left knee and it was the best thing I ever did . I was 40 at the time and since then Ive done 12 triathlons including an Ironman and several running races . I was never a runner either . I regret waiting 5 years to get the surgery after all the bad stuff I read on the web . I did exactly what the doctor ordered before and after surgey . <p> I had a lateral release 2 years ago which has crippled me and I am bed ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I lived with for 5 yrs . Went to many doctors and got many different opinions . I saw a surgeon twice and we agreed to clean up the knee . When I awoke from surgery I had learned that a lateral release was performed . I did n't  think much of it at the time and that the surgeon knew what he was doing . After a few months I knew things had gone terribly wrong as it felt like my kneecap would dislocate medially . I had and have extreme pain throughout the leg and foot . I am 30 yrs old and this has ruined my life . I do n't  know what I am going to do now . I am on heavy painkillers and bed ridden . This was the worst mistake of my life to trust a surgeon and I went from a great , happy , active life to no life , bed ridden , 4 walls , a computer , and high powered painkillers which are quite ineffective . <p> Please do not get a lateral release , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last resort , if you can have a decent quality of life even if pain killers are needed please reconsider getting surgery and just live with what you have or you might just end up bed ridden like I am , <p> All of these stories are fascinating . I have been offered a potential lateral release . However the NHS Registrar has said the surgical option should be the very last one as he made it clear the procedure did n't  always have a favorable outcome . <p> I am mid 30s , was very active cycling every day to work until I had a problem with my right knee due to badly fitting SPD pedals ! <p> The way my situation has been handled by the NHS is very bad , they clearly do not give much consideration for the young when it comes to knees . I still havent had an MRI , only an XRAY , so I am not sure what really ever happened with the knee . <p> I am keen to work on physio for the next 6 months before returning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option and may consider living with my problem . I can cycle but ca n't walk for more than an hour or so , without pain setting in <p> I no nobody has wrote on here for a while but I feel I need to make people aware that its not always doom and gloom . I 'm currently 33 and female . <p> When I was 10 years old I started to have problems with both my knees , like unexplained poker hot needle point stabbing pains . Knees giving way and locking knee caps . For 4 years my doctor said it was just growing pains . I was , and still am very active , I used to swim for the county , dance for the county and play basketball for the county , as well as all school sports events and skiing as well . <p> One day during my swimming training my coach pulled me to a side as I could no longer do breaststroke without crying in pain . The coach wrote letter to say this is more than growing pains . <p> From that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes it worse due to the force that goes through your knees whilst kicking outwards . <p> When I was 14 I was sent on a 6 month course of physio which made things a lot worse due to adductor muscles not working properly . After that I went to the orthopedic consultant who gave me more exercises which once again did n't  work . In July 1998 i had the lateral release and fluid drained from the knee cap . I was supposed to have both knees done but only got the right knee done as did n't  have time to have the other one as I was a 16 year old teenager . <p> The operation was a huge success but I have to admit recovery was hard . From 1999 2001 things were fine with my right knee until 2002 when it started to hurt again . I was referred straight back to out patients at the hospital . They did sports physio and tapped both knees for 6 months . <p> For 12 years I was pain free in my right knee and my left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain and just got on with life . I do extreme kite flying with power kites , hiking up mountains , walk at least 4 miles a day and bike ridding on a Saturday morning . <p> By April 2015 my knees were as bad or maybe even worse than when I was 14 . I have been informed by my consultant that every 15-20 years I will have to under go the procedure again as your body can revert back to how it was before the operation . I 'm currently waiting to see the surgeon to have the operation again . I know people will find this hard to believe but i cant wait to have the operation so my life can go back to normal for a good healthy few years . <p> I hope this will make people understand that yes the immediate recovery is very quick but your body my relapse within 5 year period but that is normal . Once that has passed you will hopefully be pain free maybe forever if your really lucky . <p> Physio is not always your friend as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthopedic consultant has informed me . <p> Hi there , all these negative comments are pretty much 100% true ! I myself , would n't have had knee surgery if I wouldve known how much pain i 'd be in after . <p> I 'm a 24 y/o male , who has had knee problems for the last 8-9 years . It started with just mild pains after long days , and then slowly grew into a lot of pain every day/nightmost of the time it would keep me up at night . <p> I started to get painkillers from my Dr after about 4 years of pain and agony , along with the multiple xrays &amp; mris ive had done , along with some other test . Over the last 8 years , I seen 6 different Dr regarding my knees , and none of them were able to provide me with any help or a way to fix my knees . One DR told me , and I quote , " I would n't stick a needle behind my knee , so I 'm not going to stick one behind yours " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortisone shot in each knee , which did helpbut only for about a month tops . <p> **The last DR I had , looked over all my previous tests etc , and then a physical knee exam , and he came to conclusion my left kneecap was pulled out too far . He then recommended I get a lateral release done , and while he was in there he would check everything else out . On Feb 4th of 2015 , He ended up doing the lateral release on my IT band , scrapped some build up , and then put my knee back together . I was in the hospital for 3 days after my surgery , because I could n't move my leg at all and the pain would n't subside . I had PT for 5 months , which did n't  seem to help .

@@119851048 @8851048/ <p> Two weeks ago I started a mini-project to write a simple piece of software in C# , package it up and release it . Although I had initially given myself two weeks , the actual time I spent on this project was less than a week due to a pest problem , a birthday , and a family visit . The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of a new programming language , and to learn how to package and release the initial version of a new piece of simple software . <p> Picking a language <p> I had never written a line of C# in my life but knew that it had similarities to both C++ and Java . Ive been programming with C++ and Java professionally ( by which I mean that someone pays me to do it ) for many years so it seemed an interesting new language to experiment with . <p> I downloaded the free Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition and installed it . I followed the initial tutorial to learn how to build a very basic application and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control <p> The version control system that I am used to working with is Perforce . I therefore wanted to use a different version control system for this project ( remember this is a learning exercise so I want to try new technologies ! ) . <p> I picked the well known subversion as the version control tool with TortoiseSVN as the front end to subversion . Subversion is a popular choice and is easy to use if you are used to using something like Perforce . It has many differences but also many similarities . <p> What to write ? <p> I had decided to write a Windows clipboard extender . There are loads of other clipboard extenders available but that did n't  worry me . My goal is n't to create something original , just something that I would use myself . <p> The core features that I wanted to include was stack and queue support for the clipboard . Normally copying an item of text to the clipboard overwrites the previous item . I wanted the previous values to be stored in either a queue or a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values one , two , three . I then paste ( using Ctrl-V ) and the pasted values are one , two and then three . This is the queue behaviour . If using the stack the pasted values would be three , two and finally one . <p> Online help with writing the software <p> As I was completely new to C# and its APIs , I had to do a lot of searching to find out how to do Clipboard operations . The Visual C# help system was also very good . <p> There is a huge amount of help for almost any C# problem you can think of on the internet so it was n't hard to find out how to solve any problem that I had . In particular the following articles were very helpful : <p> When releasing software you would normally ship an end-user licence agreement ( EULA ) along with the software . This tell the user what they can and cant do with your software . <p> If you want to open source your software there is a good source of licensing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted the software to be free to use but proprietary ( I 'm not shipping the source ) . It is harder to find information on how to produce a licence in this case . One option is to look at existing licences and adapt any bits you like . I used the XS EULA Generator ( update : sadly the tool no longer exists ) and then adapted it for my needs . <p> Creating an install package <p> Once I had written my clipboard extender ( which I named nbClipboard ) I needed some way to package it up with a Windows installer . <p> After looking around the best option seemed to be Inno Setup combined with ISTool ( a front end for Inno Setup ) . You can download both together by going to the Inno Setup website and downloading the QuickStart Pack . <p> This creates a professional looking software install executable which looks identical to the install tools used by many popular software applications . <p> Making a PAD file <p> To release software you can add it to your own website and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many software download websites out there . Almost all software download websites require you to submit a PAD file ( Portable Application Description ) . This file describes all the attributes of your software ( purpose , author , screenshots , OS requirements etc ) in a standard format which allows these download sites to stay up to date . <p> The format was created by the Association of Shareware Professionals ( ASP ) and they have a free PADGen tool that you can use to create the PAD file . <p> Releasing the software <p> After creating the install package and the PAD file I uploded both of them to my website and then submitted the PAD file to the ASP repository ( a store of PAD files that many software download sites use as a data source ) . <p> Just two hours after making the submission nbClipboard had appeared on two download sites and was even appearing in the Google search results as a result of one of these download sites being indexed . In the next few days it appeared on other download sites as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick these PAD files up automatically seem to be the small download sites . If you want your software to appear on better known directories such as Tucows and download.com you 'll need to handle the submission manually . <p> nbClipboard <p> nbClipboard is available from the below link and it might be available from some small software download sites as well if you can find them !

I only wanted to send one fax , and did n't fancy walking to the local copy shop to do it ( it probably would have been cheaper , but you have to factor in the time of travelling there as well ) . <p> I looked at a few sites but settled on FaxZero.com .

@@119851051 @8851051/ <p> When using utility computing platforms such as Amazon CloudFront , S3 , EC2 , or similar platforms from other companies , you are charged according to how much usage you or other people make of the files and services you publicly expose . <p> If you configure your files or services to be private only to you then you can easily control the cost . But when you make them accessible to the public ( e.g. by hosting your website images on CloudFront ) your costs are determined by people you have never met . <p> The costs tend to work out pretty cheap under normal usage , and these utility computing platforms are a great idea in theory . But what if the usage is n't normal ? What if someone decides to launch a DDOS attack on you by downloading huge amounts of data from your CloudFront or S3 account for example ? I 've no doubt that Amazon could handle the load , but could your bank account , or business cope ? <p> I 'm not singling out Amazon here ; the same applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is just that Amazon 's services set the benchmark for other similar companies so their platform provides a good example to base my calculations on . <p> The chances of such an attack happening to you are probably small , but the impact could be large , so it is worth doing the calculations before signing up . <h> Calculating the Amazon CloudFront worst case scenario <p> In order to calculate the worst case scenario we first need to understand how the pricing works . Amazon provides a page of pricing information on their website . You are charged for both bandwidth used , and the number of HTTP requests . The bandwidth cost varies depending on where in the world the data is downloaded from . <p> There are also some minor costs for file storage if you use S3 to store your data , and for loading the data if you use a custom origin server " but these are likely to be very minor costs so I will only use the bandwidth and number of requests for my calculations . <p> Next we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be be used with your default account . Although it is n't very easy to spot , there is a default limit listed on that pricing page of 1000 requests per second and 1000 megabits ( megabits not megabytes 1000 megabits = 125 megabytes ) per second . That is a lot of data for any small hobby or business site but Amazon can cope with it . They even provide a request form if you need a higher limit . <p> Using these values you can see that in an hour the maximum number of requests is 3,600,000 and the maximum bandwidth usage is about 450 gigabytes . <p> The most expensive region to download data from is Japan so I will base my calculation on the data being downloaded at the maximum number of requests and bandwidth from the Japan prices ( starting at $0.201/GB and $0.0095 per 10,000 requests as of May 2011 ) . Of course in reality it would be impossible for someone to hit you with the maximum load , but that does n't matter " I 'm calculating the theoretical worst case scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you move up the usage tiers the cost goes down ) it is a bit hard to calculate the cost using a calculator . Amazon does provide its own cost calculator but I did n't fancy using it for each data point so I 'm using Excel instead . I 'm using their cost calculator only to cross check my values to make sure that they are correct to an acceptable margin of error . <p> If you ever want to calculate tiered pricing then the SUMPRODUCT function in Excel is what will make it easy ( once you figure out its cryptic syntax that is ) . <h> CloudFront worst case hour by hour cost for the first day <p> The first graph shows the theoretical worst case scenario cost for the first 24 hours of this imagionary DDOS attack on your account . <p> After the first hour 0.45TB and 3,600,000 requests could have been charged to your account at a cost of nearly $94 . By the end of the day the cost is just over $2200 . <p> If an attack like this started how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up to a 3rd party monitoring service you would n't find out about the problem until you next signed into the Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) console . <p> Even if you try to check everyday you can be hit with a big cost while you are asleep , on a plane , at dinner , or with friends . For a big business $2200 might be nothing , but how many hobbies website builders who are using AWS could say the same ? <h> CloudFront worst case day by day cost for the first month <p> The next graph shows the maximum cost over 30 days . The subtle curve is the effect of the tiered pricing kicking in reducing the bandwidth cost each time you pass the next tier . <p> After a week your cost is over $11,000 , at two weeks it is nearly $22,000 , and after 30 days it could be over $42,000 . About $40,000 of that is the bandwidth cost and only $2,000 is the requests cost . At the end of 30 days a maximum of 324TB of data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon spot and stop the bandwidth usage ? <p> If this happened to you would Amazon ( or similar companies ) warn you ? <p> I ca n't find anything in their information that suggests they would . I 'm not even sure if they 'd notice . Although the bandwidth usage and number of hits might be huge for you , it 's peanuts for Amazon . Remember I 'm basing these figures on their default throttled account . You can request much higher usage limits if you want . <p> Would you get a refund if this happened ? Again I do n't know as their information mentions nothing about this . It does say that use are you are soely responsible for the use of your content , which may mean that if it is misued ( e.g. DDOS attack ) it is your responsibility to pay . You can understand that from Amazons point of view they will still incur costs for their own bandwidth whether the bandwidth usage is beneficial to you or not . <p> It would be good to see Amazon ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer any assistance in the event of an attack . <h> What do people pay for normal CloudFront / S3 usage ? <p> There are many people posting about their AWS bills . Most of the stories I 've read are about people saying how small their bill is . Here is a list of accounts I 've found , some are using CloudFront , and some S3 ( prices are mostly per month ) . <h> Has this problem been mentioned before ? <p> This problem has been mentioned many times on Amazon 's Web Services forums , so Amazon are aware of the issue , but as far as I 'm aware no one has ever ( until now ! ) produced worst case data for excessive usage . <h> What can Amazon do ? <p> Firstly they could make it possible to reduce the allowed bandwidth and number of hits . As the connection is already throttled , and as it is possible to increase the values , I 'm sure it would n't be that hard for them to allow you to reduce the limits . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day/week/month . Perhaps with a warning when 70% of your bandwidth is used up for example . This is what many metered web hosts do if you are near their limit . <p> A combination of both of these would probably be a good solution for most people who are worried about their potential bills . <p> Also as I previously mentioned it would be good for them to have clear public policies of what would happen if your account were hit by a DDOS attack leading to an unusually large bill . <h> What can I do ? <p> If you are concerened you can add your voice to the discussions happening on the AWS forums , or try to contact Amazon directly to request these cost control features . <p> You can sign up for a 3rd party AWS monitoring service , which could notify you if the costs go abover a certain amount . <h> And finally <p> I 'll stress again that this problem is by no means unique to Amazon . In fact I 'm not aware of any utility comuting provider that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle your usage . Therefore it wo n't help you if you to change to another similar company . <p> I 'm not saying that you should n't use these services ; in fact they are very useful and usually work well with good reliability . Just be aware of the risks . 213587 @qwx1073587 <h> 9 Responses to " Amazon CloudFront and S3 maximum cost " <p> Excellent article ! In fact , a friend of mine ran into this problem and had to pay over $1,000 . I d not know if it was a dos attack , though , but it would be a good idea if amazon gave us a tool to cap the bandwidth usage . <p> This is exactly what has happened to me now . I registered an AWS S3 account 1,5 years ago to just check it out . I also created a private webpage to upload to the account and send files back and forth to work and in the family , all this according to features described on Amazons website . <p> What was not described , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misuse of my account . Suddenly in March 2012 I got a bill around 10000 USD , after over 1 year of costs around 0,01 USD per month . It seemed that filesharers had got access to my account through the page and was generating terrabytes of bandwith usage . I had no idea that this could happen . I had secured the page with robots.txt and thought this was enough . If anyone else found the page , I thought that costs would increase slightly and slow , and not explode like this . <p> I have talked to AWS support about this , but they say that they cant see any errors on their part , and therefore I am responsible . I on the other hand feel that Amazon must also take blame , as they are offering these services without any way to monitor charges ( until recently ) or contacting the customer if unusual activity occur . They are also offering specific instructions for my use case that I have followed , without any warning . Amazon AWS has inherit security flaws , and shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outrageous . I also think it is completely unethical of Amazon to still want to profit on this disaster and not even offering to reduce the bill to actual costs incurred on Amazon when this evidently was completely unexpected and not intended beyond my control . <p> Now I have sent an email to people higher up in the Amazon organisation . Hope this will work out , but I guess I just have to pay to get out of all this . <p> But to all others , I will like to say : DO NOT OPEN AN AWS ACCOUNT ! ! ! ! <p> If you do , you must take into account unlimited costs incured by you or by hackers or otherwise . You can not count on Amazon doing anything about this , YOU are responsible for anything related to your account . <p> AWS in its current form is a rml editedvery risky/rml edited machine that everyone should stay far away from . <p> Hi Magnus , thans a lot for posting your story . A $10,000 bill is quite astonishing ! And obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I wont use AWS myself until they provide a way of capping the bill . <p> The monitoring tools/APIs are useful , but they still require manual intervention from the account owner to either deactivate the account , or delete the files that are being downloaded excessively . That is no good if ( for example ) you are sleeping , and wont see the alert for another 7-8 hours . <p> I hope you have success with getting them to reduce your bill . Do feel free to post on here again if you have any updates . <p> While its probably one of the crappiest cloud provider around , ArubaCloud is an Italian one which has hard limits . Actually even more than hard limits you do n't  even give them the credit card for recurring payments its based on a credit you recharge periodically , so you do n't  actually risk going over quota . <p> For amateurish / home made things , I find it the best solution for this exact reason .

The shop will let you borrow carpet samples for a short time as long as you have already had the measuring done first . <p> I borrowed two samples , both made of polypropylene .
