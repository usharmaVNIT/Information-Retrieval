@@36129849 @5129849/ <p> After a week off , presumably to prolong the agony , Riverdale returned this week with a highly consequential episode , one that seemed to set up the final revelation of Jason Blooms killer . To get there though , we had to indulge in more suspicion of F.P. Jones , more creepiness in the Blossom household , and more drama in the Andrews home as Archie dealt with the return of his mom , and growing feelings of desire for Veronica . Guess which one was more the priority for the red-headed scamp ? <p> After a brief appearance of Molly Ringwald at the end of episode 10 , it was Mary Andrews turn to shine in " To Riverdale and Back Again " , the title referencing a 90s TV movie/backdoor pilot about the Archies gang as adults . It seems that Riverdale has blended that idea into its DNA , again implying that the parents have long had their tendrils in each others affairs . F.P. seems to know something sorted about Alice and Hal Coopers relationship , and Alice later tries to pluck up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to be ex-husband was carrying around with his colleague , Hermoine . Mary let that roll off her back either because she did n't  believe Alice or she did n't  care . <p> So what exactly was the point of Mary coming back ? By the time we got to the end of the episode that was one of my questions because it was not addressed what internal drama lead her and Fred to break up in the first place , nor was it explained why she decided to return to town now . Was she there because of Archies drunk dial appeal to his parents for reconciliation . Was she there for one last hurrah at Homecoming ? Or was she there to entice Archie to move with her to Chicago for some false drama ? Hm , I wonder if Archies going to choose to move away from Riverdale ? <p> So having Mary Andrews around did nothing for the episode , especially when the drama around Jason Blooms murder was heating up again . Alice deduced from spying on Jugheads birthday party that F.P. and Joaquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with Jason . Unless she could read lips , you have to wonder how she made that link , especially since they 're both Southside Serpents and could be involved in any number of clandestine criminal endeavours . So using her perch as the adult supervisor of the student newspaper , she recruits the kids to help her look into it . <p> Veronica is a willing volunteer , desperate to prove that her father was n't the puppet master behind Jasons death ( or finally prove he was , as the case may be ) . She drafts Archie to help her break into F.P.s trailer while Alice keeps the Joneses occupied with a nice family dinner for a girlfriends mom to meet a boyfriends dad . Archie is concerned about Jughead being hurt again , in spite of the appearance that F.P. has literally and figuratively cleaned up his act , but let 's be honest , once a girls kissed Archie its pretty easy to hold him under thumb . <p> And what is the root of F.P.s sudden conversion to being a quality father figure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that ruddy old trailer . He s reading Jugheads work and engaging in meaningful conversations with his son about his writing . He s quit drinking , and he has n't  missed a day of work . What the hell ? It seems like only a few episodes ago that F.P. was a mess of wreck , hiding Jasons jacket , and tasking Joaquin to spy on the Sheriff by posing as Kevin Kellers boyfriend . F.P. was definitely in it deep , so what change it all around ? <p> One things for sure , the suspicion is n't doing anyone any good , and no one knows that more than Betty and Jughead . Just when everything seemed to be going great for Riverdale Highs favourite couple , the confluence of Bettys mom , and her two best friends casting renewed suspicion on her boyfriends father starts adding more pressure to Bettys already full plate . On top of that , it seems that Bettys getting lost in the case , a monster obsession of her own making , and understandably so given how her sister is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in the episode where it looked Betty was really losing it , all that ambition and optimism out the window and down the abyss . <p> Sadder still is that all the suspicion and investigation of F.P. causes a rift in our Betthead . Betty knew that her mother was up to something concerning F.P. and the dinner party , but Jughead did n't  . He thought they were doing something nice and normal . When Jughead sees Betty confront Archie and Veronica about their skullduggery , Jughead thinks Betty was in on it too , and in a way , knowing that something was up and that she did n't  say anything , she was . If there 's one thing you do n't  want to hear on the night your dad is arrested for murder , its that your girlfriend and friends might have had a hand in making it happen . <p> Oh yes , F.P. gets picked up by the police shortly after Archie and Veronica searched his trailer , the key difference between the searches though was that the police found a lock box with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when Archie and Veronica searched the trailer maybe an hour before . So who planted the gun , and who cast suspicion on F.P. all of the sudden ? Someone that knew that F.P. had Jasons jacket , presumably the same person that took the ring from Jasons car and set it ablaze the night Betty and Jughead found it ? <p> And speaking of that ring , it turned up in Penelope Blossoms jewelry box , much to the surprise of Cheryl and Polly as they were looking for some vintage jewelry to borrow for the Homecoming dance . Cheryl seemed just as surprised to find it as Polly , almost as if she thought she had rid herself of some particularly incriminating piece of evidence . Penelope explains to Polly that Jason threw the ring in her and Cliffords face the day he disappeared , a symbol of his renouncing of all that the Blossom name entailed . Polly seemed less than convinced . <p> So here 's a theory : What if Penelope and/or Clifford hired F.P. to find Jasons car and recover the ring ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mementos for insurance in case there was ever any blowback on him . But none of that answers who killed Jason . Certainly the Blossoms are suspicious , but Penelope seemed so ruined in the privacy of their home when F.P. was arrested , why put on a show when there 's no one to put on a show for ? Scratch that , there was actually someone to put on a show for , and it was Cheryl Blossom . <p> Were probably all thinking the same thing now , right ? That Cheryl killed Jason . Perhaps she was jealous of being the proverbial red-headed stepchild , saw Jason breaking free of the family structures that were being built around him and for him , got jealous , and went along with her siblings plan to run away because it afforded her the chance to get rid of him in a much more permanent way . Why else would she hold on to the ring , a symbol of the Blossom legacy that was about to be passed on to the next generation of Blossoms that did n't  include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Polly and everyone a few weeks ago has now taken a back seat .

To remember a time when TV shows felt the need to remind us that the storys not over at the end of an hour is like remembering when you had to set your VCR manually to tape something , or only being able to use the internet when no one was using the telephone . Even from a 1990 perspective , you have to admit adding " To be continued " to the end of the first season finale of- Twin Peaks was grossly unnecessary considering the fate of several main characters was up in the air , while the fate of the main suspects was profoundly more certain . <p> Let 's start with the suspects , and if you ever want to look guilty for a committing a crime , you do exactly what Leo Johnson does in this episode . Yes , he survived Shelly shooting him in " Episode 5 " , taking the bullet in the arm it seems , but while perched like a psycho waiting to shoot Shellys lover Bobby with a long-range rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The sweet , innocent widow appears far more conniving than originally advertised as she 's now not only revealed to be working with Ben Horne , but she appears to be working to get Catherine out of the way .

She even had to confide in Pete , which was a little awkward , but surprisingly sweet . <p> More disturbing- than Josies plans for her sister-in-law though were the plans she 's already carried through with concerning her deceased husband . It seems as though Josie paid off Hank Jennings to " accidentally " get in a hit and run with Mr. Packard , with $90,000 being the going rate for a husband-icide in 1990 dollars . It suggests that Josies plan to sell the mill and escape with the money might go back years , and its enough to make you wonder if maybe Catherine suspected Josie of being involved with her brothers death . It might explain the bad blood if Catherine suspected that there was blood spilled . <p> Speaking of bad blood , Bobby continued his half-assed conspiracy to rid himself of all enemies by framing James for drug possession . His bad luck lead him to follow James and Donna on the same night they launched with Maddies help an entrapment scheme on Dr. Jacoby .

The tape offered some frank confessions from dark Laura , how she saw James as sweet but dumb , and lamenting her ability to make men do the things she wants them to do . " I get off on it , " she adds glibly .

And yes , Ben is not only a client of Jacks , but he s also the owner . <p> As for Cooper , he was at Jacks in a Bookhouse Boys undercover operation to smoke out Jacques Renault and get him stateside to take him into custody .

The same assailant , it seems , that shows up at the Northwestern later that night and shoots Agent Cooper three times ! Is this Bob ? And if so , why is he so anxious to get Agent Cooper out of the way ? And if not , who else could possibly want Agent Cooper dead ?

@@36129895 @5129895/ <p> In these next episodes of Twin Peaks we start to see the various plot lines coalesce as progress is not just made on the murder mystery of Laura Palmer , but on the backstabbing and double-dealing between the towns business interests both legitimate and illicit . Circumstances now force us to take this series two episodes at a time if we hope to catch up before the launch of Showtimes new season next month , which suits ( Burns better ) me because the impulse to binge the show is getting stronger as all the elements starting coming together to resolve some of the central mysteries , and take us deeper into others . <p> First of all , it seems like everyones doing their own investigation into the death of Laura Palmer . James and Donna draft Maddie Ferguson into their efforts after discovering that someone had taken James half of Lauras heart-shaped necklace . Maddie , who James immediately notes is Lauras spitting image , uses her inside access to the Palmer home and discovers something in Lauras room that 's big enough to require an urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that Laura was in trouble , even though she admits she did n't  really know Laura that well , so it begs a deeper look at the- question , why these two cousins could pass as their own twin ? <p> Speaking of that necklace , we know that Jacoby has it , and it seemed like an interrogation by Agent Cooper has prompted Jacoby to start his own inquiries . Using a family counseling session with the Briggses , Jacoby paints Bobby in a corner while one-on-one , seemingly using some details Laura told him against Bobby , how she laughed at him when he cried after the first time they made love . Jolting Bobby out his typically snarky and sarcastic mode , he tells Jacoby how Laura wanted to die , how she wanted to bring out the darkness inside people and tempt them to corrupt themselves . Hardly the picture of someone that Jacoby says made him find the quality of his practice again , though he does note that Lauras dug addiction was a positive sign that she knew she needed help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking of nose candy , the spotlight of suspicion turned more harshly on Jacques Renault , whose the importer of drugs to Twin Peaks along with Leo Johnson . While others were trying to put the pieces to the Palmer mystery together , Bobby and Shelly decide to help it along to its end by planting Leos bloody shirt in Jacques apartment . Cooper and Truman are led to suspect Jacques after Hawk finds a one-armed man whose friend was a veterinarian who was treating a bird belonging to Jacques that left bite marks on Laura Palmers body . Did you follow that ? I 've watched a lot of cop shows and I do wonder how the Sheriffs Department gets warrants based on evidence a federal agent got in a dream <p> So what did they find ? They found the planted shirt belonging to Leo Johnson , but the blood it was covered in was Jacques . They also found a copy of Flesh World magazine with letters sent to a P.O. Box owned by Jacques , but addressed to Ronette and Laura .

Jacques is hiding out there , Ronette worked there , and the Horne Brothers are regular visitors there . Audrey has an idea of its significance , otherwise why would she know to direct Agent Cooper there . Audrey is someone else initiating her own line of investigation , conning her father into giving her a job at the department store and then conning the manager to put her on the perfume counter , where Ronette and Laura both worked . But what did Audrey discover that made her turn up naked and hysterical in Agent Coopers room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An answer to that question will have to wait because there 's so much going on with other people named Horne .

And why is Josie giving him the fake ledger that Catherine had supposedly hidden ? And why was Josie following Catherine and Horne , and was spying on them like a private dick outside the motel ? <p> Perhaps Horne is doing a double blind bluff . Maybe he has doubts that Catherine can deliver the mill and the rest of the land , and decided to go to the source . Maybe Josie , knowing that Catherine is trying to undermine her , just wants to beat her to the punch and undermine the woman that 's treated her brothers widow so horribly by taking the only thing that matters her to her : the profit to be made from selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josies relationship with Harry have in the scheme ? Is he a useful pawn or are their genuine feelings there ? Call me a sucker , but I think that Josies dance with the devil is a recent development , perhaps she 's just at her wits end with Catherine and her scheming . <p> here 's something else , if Ben Horne is about to get the mill free and clear from Catherine , why was he plotting to burn it all down with Leo at the end of " Episode 4 " ? I think somewhere between " Episode 4 " and " Episode 5 " Josie came to Ben with a counter-proposal , which is probably a good thing because Leo does n't  look nearly as intimidating as he used to . Not only did Bobbys amateur set-up work like a charm , but Bobby had been stoking Shelly up for a couple of days to finally use that gun she 's been keeping for Leo . At the end of " Episode 5 " she shoots him , and we hear Leo scream , but how much damage did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a bad day . He had to kill Jacques brother Bernard so that the other Renault would n't talk , and then Normas convict husband Hank got parole and the first person he want after was Leo . Before getting shot , Hank punched Leo in the head and told him that he was supposed to be minding the store and not starting his own franchise . I guess we all have someone to answer to , but what is the extent of Hanks power ? He s sending threatening sketches to Josie , and eavesdropping on James , Donna , and Maddie , but how much does he have to do with the death of Laura and other doings in Twin Peaks when he s been behind bars ? <p> It feels like there 's so much going on that we almost forget the main victim of this series , and those immediately close to her . Poor Leland Palmer . His grief is so palpable and it almost seems like no one cares . Well , they care , but everyone seems to be getting on with their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its an inconvenience to have a father with a murdered daughter walking around . It feels like Leland in his endless malaise is the the thing were supposed to be vaguely aware of , but perhaps it has more meaning than we realize .

@@36129897 @5129897/ <p> The wait is over . Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 2 has been released to theaters everywhere . Joyous is the sound of fans and general audiences , singing the praise of another smash hit from director James Gunn and co . Its true . Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 albeit not as fresh and new as the first one and perhaps a little too big a spectacle for its own good is way fun , warm ( a lot of feels in this movie ) , and is everything going to the movies should be a good time . While numbers are still rolling in , it saw $56 million at the box office on opening day , and is targeting a big $140 million weekend . Suffice to say , it delivered and is performing as well as everyone hoped it would . And no one is as thankful and as happy as the films director James Gunn . <p> Taking to- Facebook- earlier today , Gunn put out one of the sincerest and earnest thank you to fans , opening up about his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved his life , and what box office success really means to him . <p> He starts off saying : <p> " I 've spent the past two and a half years making a film , probably a good 95% of my non-sleeping life during that time , and sometimes it seems it all comes down to these few weeks of release in theaters . Let me tell you , its harrowing . The movie is doing incredibly all over the world , up nearly fifty percent over the first film in most territories , and a breakout hit in countries where it did n't  do as well the first time around ( hi , Korea ! ) I 'm exceptionally proud of how well its doing in the countries Ive visited and where I 've made many friends the past few years , Thailand , Brazil , Colombia , Russia , the UK . Youve all welcomed me into your countries and I 'm a better person for my interactions with you . " <p> To a guy like James Gunn , Box Office numbers do n't  really matter to him but- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how things are playing out : <p> " So , as we open up around the world , I would be lying if I said I do n't  get distracted by the numbers . The first thing I do in the morning is roll over in bed and check my phone for the morning box office reports . But , in the end , its not what matters to me . I write this now to let you know , but also to remind myself . Because I 'm human and I sometimes forget . " <p> The message continues on , and it gets deeply personal : <p> When I was young I felt utterly alone , at times to the point of suicidal thoughts . I never felt like I belonged , had an incredibly difficult time connecting to other people and , despite having love around me , I had an impossible time experiencing it , or taking it in . But I found my respite in popular entertainment , Marvel comics , science fiction and horror films , the music of The Sex Pistols , The Replacements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world , a world more aligned with what I imagined . Sometimes these works were simply escapist fantasies that distracted me from the difficulties of my internal life . But other times , in the strongest moments , maybe through the words of Alice Cooper or Freddie Mercury , through Cronenberg films , or even in Chewbaccas growl , I experienced something deeper , the realization that I was n't completely alone . Someone out there was as weird and strange and whacked out as I was.So this morning , as the internet discusses box office and its many theories around what that means ( zzzzzzzz ) , I 'd like to remember that that 's truly all nonsense and noise . The only meaning the money holds for me is that I can pay my mortgage , feed my dog and cat , and continue making movies . I have n't worked two and a half years just to watch a string of numbers getting higher . " <p> He concludes his message with warm regards to the passion that is his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in avenue in which to connect with people and have people connect with each other : <p> " I work because I like telling stories . I work because I love the relationships I have with my collaborators . And I do it because I like connecting with people , and the easiest way I know how to do that is through filmmaking . I do it so that some kid in Thailand , or England , or Colombia , or Brazil , or Japan , or Russia , or anywhere , can hear the frequency of his or her own heart bouncing back off the Guardians . They 're a group of heartbroken misfits whose lives have been bereft of tenderness and connection and who have a nearly impossible time trusting themselves or others . But they 're learning , one step at a time . They are me . They are you . We are Groot . And no matter how much world leaders are telling you we are n't  in this together , we are . You are not alone . Thank you so much , my Facebook friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half years , and thank you for all the messages letting us know we 've keyed into the frequency of your hearts . I love you all , and I 'll continue being here with you over the next three years as we create Vol. 3 . Love James . PS Still blocking spoilers . Sorry . " <p> Wow . What a guy , right ? The world is just much better for having someone like James Gunn in it . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

A- cartoon that ran from 1983-85 , which existed solely to promote the exceedingly popular ( the most popular even ) toy line of the same name . It spawned a corny live-action adaption that starred- Dolph Lundgren- ( who was surely robbed of the Oscar that year ) and- Frank Langella , as well as young Courtney Cox . The cartoon was rebooted in 2002 but managed to only run 39 episodes . An action figure line from that series was produced , then later a line of mini statues . Another and now a current line of figures are produced by Mattel and sold on their collectors website . The property is licensed to a number of other vendors as well , such as Funko , Super 7 , Entertainment Earth . All of which are finding that the nostalgia for- He-Man and The Masters of The Universe- is as strong as ever . Out of every outfit capitalizing on the sentimentality felt by children of the 80s , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collectible statues inspired by the popular 80 's cartoon are the earnest of representations , and completely unlike anything that has come before them . <p> No better show of display , than by checking out the very first in their 1:5 statue series , the one and only He-Man the most powerful man in the Universe. - ( more ) <p> Ahh , the 1980s , when toys dictated the content of your television , and Saturday morning cartoons reigned- supreme . One of the kings of weekend-morning comic machismo was He-Man and the Masters of the Universe , a show premised around Prince Adam channeling the power of the Castle Grayskull to unleash his inner barbarian ( becoming He-Man ) , and battle the evils of the nefarious , skull-faced Skeletor . While a great success at the time , launching hundreds ( if not thousands ) of toys , various comic books , and even a ( terrible ) movie starring Dolph Lundgren , He-Man has not shared much of the nostalgic-based revival success of other 80s cartoons like G.I. Joe or Transformers , the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ran for two seasons , and an internet meme nearly a decade back . Despite this , He-Man ( especially the 80s cartoon ) still has quite a cult following , and it looks those fans will be rewarded at this years SDCC.

Now , Dreamworks TV revived He-Man And The Masters of The Universe to its lineup of kid friendly shows like Life Hacks for Kids and Sung History .

The new(er) He-Man and the Masters of the Universe comic series is already up to issue #18 and the latest development is the rise of one of the He-Man universe 's most well-known characters She-Ra . But this time , the female counterpart to the burly defender of Eternia is looking a bit more battle worthy . Scroll on to see She-Ra 's new look .

They do , however , have fabulous secret powers at ruining one beloved franchise after another ( Ghost Rider , Amazing Spider-Man ) .

Joe 3 . You do n't  have to like Mr. Chus movies ( I know I do n't  ) , but the dude sure has a penchant for talking passionately . Its too bad he does n't  have the same passion for creativity and talent . Ouch , was that harsh ? No , harsh was sitting through 2 hours of G.I. Joe Retaliation . <p> I have the power to not care about anything director Jon Chu says . Sure , he s a fan of 80s cartoons and speaks passionately about them . When it comes to adapting beloved filmation from 30 years ago , he even says all the right things . He s convincing , I 'll give him that . His follow-thru , however , not so much . <p> I heard him speak many times about his " Yo Joe " mentality , growing up on the G.I. Joe cartoon and understanding its message about leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrongs of the first abortion of a flick and not just make another action movie . Guy sounded a like a real American hero . Well , his homage to the G.I. Joe franchise , G.I. Joe : Retaliation did n't  exactly suck , but that 's only because nothing can be worse than G.I. Joe : Rise of Cobra . While there were flashes of resemblance to the original cartoon ( overabundance of ninjas and shit ) , it was a far cry from the source material , and well , turned out to be just another action flick . Like we could have expected anything truly worthy from the guy who directed that Justin Bieber documentary Never Say Never ? <p> Now , I 'm not here to talk about the critical failings of G.I. Joe : Retaliation. - No , I 'm just using that as my point . He had his chance and he blew it . He needs to stay the fuck away from all 80s properties . Namely such , He-Man and the Masters of the Universe . <p> An adaptation of the cartoon featuring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful friends as they face the evil forces of Skeletor , has been an raging for years . Sony Pictures eventually picked up the rights somewhere along the way and have been gunning for live-action treatment ( forgetting the really bad 1987 movie having already been made ) and capitalize on that sweet 80s nostalgia. - Since the latest Joe flicked did so well , Sony has appointed Jon Chu to direct MOTU . Go figure . <p> While talking to- SuperheroHype , Chu gave an update on what 's going on with Masters of the Universe , and he does that whole overly excited thing , which gets me excited . Heres what he said : <p> " I think that what helps us is knowing what we do in Joe and knowing that Masters has to be very different and has to feel very different , but the script for Masters of the Universe is what really hooked me . I love Masters of the Universe , but I did n't  know necessarily how to make it into a movie until I read the script and thought , Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this is going to shake it up , I get how this is different from any other thing , and it got me really really excited . " <p> He goes on to say , <p> " Were still working on that one and Joe has momentum right now . The audience has been great and they want another one , so were rushing to get that done and Dwayne has a certain time period so it may end up that Joe goes first in all those things and I do n't  know if Masters of the Universe will wait for me or where that 's going to end up . But right now its been great . Weve been designing a ton of stuff for Masters of the Universe as a really beautiful , grounded , honest world that 's the best way I can describe it . Its everything you want Masters of the Universe to be in terms of the fantasy but not in a way theatrical crazy way . It is actually a gorgeous world that were doing in the initial visual concepts that we 've been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say shit like that ? That certainly sounds like the MOTU Ive always played out in my head , but why you got ta sell us on promises you know you cant keep ? You 're like an Asian-American Uwe Boll . Just stop it . Leave my childhood alone . Its already been goatsied enough by the likes of Micheal Bay and your sloppy seconds that was G.I. Joe 2 . <p> He-Man is n't the greatest of cartoons . Its not even a very good one . Its silly , stupid and filled with homoerotic undertones . Regardless , I 'm a fan . As such , I have expectations that can never be met . I envision an EPIC , high-budgeted , stylistic , Sci-Fi , fantasy , action flick that 's dark and bleak with a modicum of humor ( for the kiddies ) . 300 meets Lord of The Rings . Something like that , but I know its never gon na happen and certainly not by the likes of Jon Chu . The hell with him and any director that wants to make it .

On December 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several , well known genre authors , of which Martin is also an editor , is releasing from Tor . Martins contribution is a short story entitled , " The Princess and the Queen , or , The Blacks and the Greens , " and it serves as history of a very famous Westerosi event , the Dance of the Dragons . <p> A war of succession between Aegon II and his half-sister Rhaenyra over their father Viserys Is throne , the war was fought from 129AL to 131AL . It saw the deaths of both rival monarchs , and the crowning of Rhaenyras son Aegon III . <p> A history ( somewhat abridged ) of the Dance of the Dragons , as set down by a maester of the Citadel . <p> To get your very first taste of Martins account of Maester Archmaester Gyldayn version of the events head on over to Tor.com for an excerpt .

Think you 'll be snagging a copy ? Or are you patiently awaiting The Winds of Winter ? Oh , who am I kidding ! ? Is there anyone waiting for The Winds of Winter , patiently ? <p> Sooner rather than later the HBO series will begin work on Season 7 , which is where I 'm guessing well see the events from A Song of Ice and Fires sixth book , The Winds of Winter , begin to transpire . And while such a season may seem a ways off Season 3 of Game of Thrones airs this Sunday at 9pm EST that date is ever encroaching on author George R.R. Martin . Its as if he can see David Benioff and Dan Weiss in the rear view mirror and he s still stuck first gear trying to finish book six . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So I need to write faster . The last two books took a really long time , so I 'm hoping this one the Winds of Winter will go a little faster . But I make no promises . I found out long ago that when you look at the overall task , the cathedral you have to build , it looks so daunting that you just give up and sit down and play a video game . <p> George , no video games ! No more side projects ! I want you working on nothing else but ASOIAF until The Winds of Winter is published and in my hands . Even then its only a short break before you need to bust out A Dream of Spring . And do n't  even begin thinking about needing to split the seventh book into the seventh and the eighth .

Upside : creative control by a studio can take a character to new heights youve never imagined its like you 're experiencing the story for the first time . Down side : Where the hell is Glorfindel ? <p> The latest to experience this , is none other than HBOs ( fucking awesome ) Game of Thrones , adapted from George R.R. Martins epic tale - A Song of Ice and Fire . While the reasons characters/plots/ general story are sometimes altered , disregarded , or whole chapters thrown in a fire to keep warm on chilly evenings , still remains a mystery , Martin had this to say in an interview with Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an increasing number of deviations from the books " not so many in Season 1 but more in Season 2 <p> GRRM : I think that 's a process that 's likely to continue , and some of that is just the nature of the process . I mean , when you make Everything is related to everything else . So , if you make a small change in Season 1 , it could lead to a really big change in Season 4 because the thing that was supposed to happen did n't happen and the guy who was supposed to come in never appeared and it was just a line in that book but now you 're in this later season and you do n't have him set up . So , everything gets magnified and you have to deal with it . <p> So who knows what story well end up with . Because According to Martin ( and I 'm just paraphrasing here ) YA - FUCKED UP !

Or , yknow , I 'd be okay with after as long as that means well be reading Winds of Winter some time this year .

Disobeying this death wish was Ser Criston Cole , Lord Commander of the Kingsguard , soon to be " The Kingmaker , " who chose Rhaenyras half-brother , Aegon , to be King , and civil war broke out . It was Targaryen versus Targaryen , and more importantly , dragon versus dragon . In the end Aegon won and was crowned Aegon II . Rhaenyra captured and eaten by Aegon IIs dragon , while her son , also named Aegon watched . Aegon II died soon after and since he left no heir , Rhaenyras son was crowned Aegon III . <p> That 's as much as we 've known about this dance of the dragons , but " The Princess and the Queen , " as GRRM stated on his blog , will reveal , " the true ( mostly ) story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> What are you thinking ?

It took almost four decades , though , before the whole superhero thing took over pop culture completely . Even a one-time illegal street racing flick , a Point Break knock-off no less , eventually mutated into the equivalent of superheroes with muscle cars . Forget believing a man could fly . Now moviegoers will not only believe a muscle car can jump over a submarine , theyll willing applaud the utter and total ridiculousness of it all . And " ridiculous " is exactly the right word- where the multi-billion dollar- Fast &amp; Furious series is concerned : Its turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensory-overloading fun . <p> With the late Paul Walkers character , Brian OConner , permanently absent with leave ( living a life of comfortable retirement ) , the full weight of the Fast &amp; Furious series falls on Vin Diesel and Dwayne " Do n't  Call Me the Rock " Johnsons shoulders . Their characters , Dom Toretto , an illegal street racer , part-time thief , and improbable government super-spy , and Luke Hobbs , a government super-agent , started off on opposite sides of the law . Over three entries , though , they set aside their differences and became allies and to borrow Doms favorite word , " family . " No surprise then that after an extended , Havana , Cuba-set prologue that puts Dom back in the drivers seat of a street car , winning a street race , but trashing his car in the precess , Dom answers Lukes call for help on a super-secret mission in Berlin without a second thought .

Dom also escapes with the object of Lukes mission , an EMP device , part of Ciphers master plan to bend the world to her whims ( or something ) .

Its the same plot device the last James Bond flick , Spectre , used to turn Blofeld into the unseen puppet master who orchestrated all of Bonds setbacks and defeats across- - the last four entries in the long-running series. - For better or for worse , its clear- Cipher has been set up to be- more than a one-movie villain .

Dalton was part of the show from the beginning , but his character was killed off in season three , and then he played the alien Inhuman possessing the body of Ward in the second half of that season- before being killed off again . But things are looking up for Dalton because Ward is back . In alternative universe form ! <p> " Its Ward 95 , " Dalton joked about playing this fourth iteration of his character . " Some of you guys are too young to understand that reference .

" Its very , very cool and its actually a way for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world we know , and now on the world that never was , " Dalton said . " So now we have alternate timelines , and my thought was that Ward might be a baker , or a dog trainer , but it did n't  go that way . " <p> Of course , a lot of stuff did n't  go Daltons way , like finding out that his fine upstanding character was a double agent in HYDRA . According to Dalton he " did n't find out too far in advance " of the audience that Ward was going bad . " They gave me a different jacket , and they said you do n't have to shave anymore , " he recalled of the turn . " I started listening to different music , I do n't know if that helped , but its an interesting thing because its like driving at night and you can only respond to what 's visible where the headlights are illuminating , and you do n't have the luxury of knowing the turn that 's up to head and make a different decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . " <p> When Ward was eventually killed off , Dalton played the part of Hive , that " alien guy that looked like he just came out of The Matrix , " but through it all he missed Ward 1.0 . " I- like the guy in the pilot , he had wise-cracking lines and stuff like that , and I liked that character , " said Dalton . " He seemed to have an Indiana Jones quality to him and he lost a bit of that as season one continued . I thought it was fun . " <p> But it seems that what Daltons gained is far more than what Ward lost . Got a major franchise film role requiring a tall , square-jawed man of a certain age ? Then Daltons name has probably come up in the media . Like Green Lantern , for example . " My names has been on a list of things I 'm not sure I would legitimately get , " Dalton cracked , but he would definitely like to throw his hat in the ring for one role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Nathan Drake in Uncharted , " Dalton said to cheers . " Not only do I look exactly like the guy I feel like I should be getting royalties eventually but it would be such a great part because he 's a swash-buckler and adventurer , and I hope on the show that I 've proved that I 'm coordinated enough to do it convincingly . Its about good old fashioned adventure . " <p> But do n't  think Dalton is all about action . " I was born for the role of a Disney prince , so the answer is where do I sign ? " Dalton said when a fan asked if he would ever appear in a remake , but what remake ? Would The Little Mermaid- be out of the question ? She is his favourite princess. - " Probably Ariel , " he said . " She 's got a nice voice . " <p> In the meantime , Daltons got a crowdfunded web series on his to-do list called- Trust No One .

We should be ok . <p> ( laughs ) Yeah , totally . You know , that theme song was so ahead of its time . <p> Absolutely . As a matter of fact , I have it as one of my ringtones . <p> Dude , I want to do that actually . That 's a great idea . <p> Yeah , I like it ; it 's always fun to hear . So , what did you think about the new Power Rangers reboot ? <p> It was perfect . It was like superheroes for people who like sci-fi . <p> Right ? <p> It had that like futuristic tinge thing , with like a mystery element to it . It was pretty epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being said , your Bootleg Universe Power Rangers - " it 's one of the coolest short films in a very , very long time . Obviously , it 's a stark turn from the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers that we watched as kids . Do you feel that dark turn had any sort of influence on the direction that Saban took with the reboot ? <p> Oh yeah , absolutely ! I mean , absolutely , right ? <p> Do you feel that it 's just more the way films are heading these days ? At least , with respect to comic book and YA television properties ? It 's starting to get a little bit more R rated , a little bit more gritty in terms of everything . I mean , when you look at the success of let 's say , Deadpool or Logan ; I mean , Deadpool 's not necessarily dark but just a little bit more violent . But , we are heading more in that direction . What do you think it is that 's leading us that way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what I think is going on . I think the internet has kind of exposed the world as not being this glossy , friendly place that the mainstream media has made us all think that it is . And the idea of Captain America in 2017 is kind of offensive . The idea of a bunch of white guys in a room sitting there trying to decide what the future of the world should look like is offensive to a lot of people . Maybe on a subconscious level . And the same thing happened in the comic books right ? I mean , The Avengers and The Fantastic Four were so popular , they were so huge and they were kind of , like , everything . And then all of the sudden , the X-Men came along and everything that was cool about The Avengers started becoming kind of a joke , right ? And that 's just history repeating itself . It 's like that moment when Todd McFarlane changed how Spider-Man moved and he changed the way that Spider-Man 's webbing was drawn . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of felt really dated and silly . <p> - Sure . <p> And it 's history repeating itself in that context . <p> Right , basically , there are plenty of storylines and plots that we have already seen , so things do begin to feel a bit dated . When you look at , say , Marvel because they 're the most apparent there , they do have a very formulaic approach to pretty much every single one of their films . You pretty much know Act 1 , Act 2 , Act 3 and how it 's going to turn out . DC , they 've kind of gone , obviously , the opposite direction and taken it to a darker place , and they are trying to surprise people . Do you believe that there is some sort of happy medium in there ? Or do you think that one way or the other is better ? <p> No , look , it 's all about diverse experiences . And they should all be able to co-exist , you know . There should be an endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden , you know , dark and gritty is going to do better than bright and funny . But there 's room for everything . And one of the great things about comic books is they exist across every genre . Like , to lump the X-Men in with The Avengers for instance , is a complete.they both get kind of labeled superhero right ? <p> Right . <p> But they 're so different . X-Men is superheroes for people who like sci-fi , for people who want stories about outcasts . So earlier , when I was saying like , you know , people find The Avengers ' mentality of No , no , it 's on us to save the world ' coming from almost an elitist place . We have all of these abilities so we 're going to do it ' . The X-Men " they resonated because they were n't necessarily trying to save the world . They were like , Hold on . Everyone thinks we 're criminals . We 're not . So we need to become the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , all of the sudden , there 's like crazy terrorist mutants that are blowing buildings up and the X-Men are trying to stop them . They 're like do n't make things worse for us ! ' <p> Right . The mutants are basically just trying to live while The Avengers are trying to tell others how to live . <p> Exactly . Exactly . Bingo . You just literally hit the nail on the head . <p> ( laughing ) Perfect . <p> I feel like a lot of times when I start talking about The Avengers that people just think I hate white people or something . <p> ( laughs ) <p> And it 's not that at all . I 'm just hating on the fact that these are a bunch of dudes who are literally sitting in a tower owned by a billionaire , who 's constantly showboating and telling everyone how to live . <p> Yeah , shit 's getting a little too real with that is n't it ? <p> - Yeah . That 's the problem . And then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality now . So again , the idea of Captain America is kind of offensive . <p> Now , you mentioned a moment ago that you feel that there is room for everything . I know at one point there was talk that fans may actually get a full length film featuring your Power Rangers in your Bootleg Universe . Is that something that may still come to pass , now that we 've got the actual reboot out ? <p> I ca n't talk about that , my man . I apologize . <p> Okay , no worries . What is it about the Power Rangers that has kept them so popular for so long now ? <p> Well , they were doing the Cinematic Universe the Marvel Cinematic Universe thing way before Marvel Cinematic Universe existed . Right ? It takes place in one continuous timeline for the most part . So , the Rangers keep popping up , old rangers come back ( kinda cool that way ) . The visual aesthetic was so different to America at the time . And that aesthetic is now iconic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spawn- still iconic . It 's not like Spawn has the best story of all time . It 's a story that 's been told- but Spawn 's look was just so iconic because Todd knew how to create this character that , visually , no one had any doubt about who this guy was . Like , that 's Spawn . <p> Exactly . <p> So , I think that they have a visual aesthetic that becomes iconic . It effectively immortalizes you . <p> So , in your bootleg universe then , and not being able to talk too much more about that , obviously there are a lot of stories out there . There are a lot of comics , there are a lot of movies , whatever . Do you think that we 'll ever see a mash-up of these characters within the Bootleg Universe where they can actually work together ? Like are we going to see a Marvel and DC film , possibly ? Bruce Wayne : Agent of SHIELD , or something ? <p> I 've actually thought about that . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos on the internet you know ? <p> Sure . <p> And they do a really good job of that . It 'll be like Luke Skywalker fighting Spider-Man . <p> Right . Or Goku vs . Superman or something . <p> Right . And there 's a place for those . And those things are very popular . I would argue that in a lot of ways they 're more popular than the stuff I 'm doing in terms of just sheer viewership . But , I 'm actually curious thoughI have a question for you . <p> Sure ? <p> I get covered a lot and I 'm not an attention seeking dude . Right ? But I get covered a lot . But the guys that make the fight videos do n't . Why is that ? Is it because I also come from traditional media ? <p> I would say so . I mean , when you 're producing movies like The Grey and Machine Gun Preacher , or Dredd , which , I mean , I do n't know if I 've ever met anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Superman , obviously it gets you a lot more attention because you have a bigger platform at that point . A bigger audience base . <p> Could it be , also , that there 's an idea behind all of these bootlegs ? There 's a point of view , there 's a different narrative and there 's a big idea whether it 's dealing with PTSD or the Power Rangers , or it 's like the idea that we 're glorifying this James Bond character , but like things are n't going to end up well for us . Could it also be that there is an idea behind the Bootleg Universe films ? <p> Absolutely . Personally , I 've always had the opinion that it 's not the tale , it 's he who tells it . Say that you toss one of your bootleg ideas out to somebody else . What they come up with may not necessarily be in line with what you saw in your head when you had the idea . So the fact that you 're able to put those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainI think that that 's a big deal . And not everybody can do that . <p> Okay . I buy that . <p> ( Laughs ) . Alright , good .

Since then , the toy industry has enjoyed a great deal of profit when it comes to licensing figures based on movies , but it does n't  come without controversy . When Star Wars : The Force Awakenslaunched their line of toys , there was one figure who was mostly absent and this caused a real stir . Now , thanks to people like Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley ( Scrawl , Star Wars : The Force Awakens , and Only Yesterday ) , the action figure industry has changed forever . <p> When The Force Awakens line of toys was first announced , there was a significant lack of representation : Rey , played by Ridley who was also the main character from the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Rey was featured in so few toy lines that her absence even sparked a trending hashtag on Twitter , #WheresRey . This was primarily focused on a Target box-set that included six figures from the film , all of whom were male .

Samantha Lomow , Senior VP of marketing at Hasbro recently spoke about the issue : <p> " Consumer and retailer research shows more and more children and their parents are interested in the " Star Wars " and Marvel franchises as well as the female characters represented within entertainment . In 2015 , for the first time , the National Retail Federation reported that Star Wars was on the top 10 toy lists for both boys and girls . Fans and families are at the center of this conversation , for example , voting for strong female characters in both the Transformers and Marvel franchises to become future figures . " <p> There does n't  seem to be any stopping the current trend of female-driven films or their action figure counterparts so the change in our culture has definitely been a positive one . Its not just a positive for social justice and equal representation of women in film and toys , it has also been a huge boost in profits .

@@36129937 @5129937/ <p> Oh cmon Walking Dead ! You were doing so well ! The first half of season 7 was downright boring , but hope was renewed- during the second half as the main group of survivors got back together and began making their plans to take down the big bad Negan . War is coming and we cant wait ! . So you give us an episode about Eugene and Dwight ? ! ? ! Fear has returned as the audience braces for more long and drawn out story lines that we really do n't  care about . <p> The saddest part about this weeks episode of The Walking Dead , is that it could have easily been edited down and shown within another , better- episode . Instead , we get a full hour of Eugene crying and Dwight doing some crap that absolutely no one cares about . <p> As always , <p> SPOILERS FOR THE WALKING DEAD , although there is n't much to spoil anyway . <p> The main survivors of Rick and company are currently out on a quest to recruit soldiers and guns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could be talking more about what they are doing , but instead we are talking about Eugenes day as a guest of Negan . At the very least , this would be a great way to showcase the character and add depth , but in classic Walking Dead fashion , the show gives us another uninteresting look at what Eugene is doing while the rest of the group is undoubtedly doing something much more entertaining . <p> For starters , Eugene is given a luxurious room with all the furnishings you can get in a post apocalyptic world . There is even a moment of sheer terror as Eugene turns on the radio and- the audience is treated to " Easy Street " , the same song that haunted Darryl while he stayed at Casa de Negan . When you think- about it , this shows that Negan had more respect for Darryl than he does for Eugene . Darryl was immediately thrown in the hole in a campaign to mentally and emotionally break him . In contrast , Eugene is given a nice room and some clout with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coward Eugene is , so he does not fear that Eugene will try to escape . Another factor could be that Negan knows that he will have Eugene make bullets at some point and it would be better to have Eugene as a willing participant than a simple hostage . <p> Then we are treated to half of the episode being focused on Dwight . Insert sarcastic enthusiasm . It turns out that Dwights wife , Cheri , is the person who let Darryl out of the hole . Shortly after , Cheri made a run for it too . While openly denying it , Dwight instantly knew it was his ex-wife Cheri who let Darryl go . After beating up on Dwight , Negan let him go look for the wife , Cheri. - Dwight goes to their old house and has fond memories of Cheri as the letter she left for Dwight is narrated to the audience . The prolonged scene establishes that Dwight and Cheri once loved each other but JEEZ , cant you just give that to the audience in a montage or something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As some sort of bizarre reward , Negan sends- 3 of his wives to spend the evening with Eugene . However , Negan specifically states that there is to be no sex between Eugene and Negans wives . As if there was going to be anyways . After impressing the ladies with his scientific knowledge , two of them ask them to make some poison for a wife that wants to end it all while she is asleep . Eugene realizes that the pills they are requesting are for Negan himself ad promptly wants nothing to do with it . <p> Back to Dwight going back to the home he shared with his ex-wife Cheri . There he found a letter written and narrated by Cheri , explaining that she was responsible for them going back to Negan after they had escaped . She also said that because of that decision , she also felt responsible for changing Dwight from the man she had loved to the man he had become . Dwight mourns the loss of his ex-wife and still , nobody cares . <p> Upon returning to Sanctuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time its the doctor . Dwight planted the " goodbye honey " portion of the letter from Cheri into the doctors desk so that Negan could link the doctor to Cheris- leaving and helping Darryl escape . Negan explained that the doctor released Darryl in order to impress Cheri and that Cheri ran simply because Negan would have thought that she was the one who released him. - The poor doctor ended up confessing- with the iron inches away from his face . Naturally , Negan threw the doctor into the furnace . <p> The episode ended- with Negan visiting Eugene to ask him who he is . Eugene said he was Negan before Negan could finished the question . Eugene admittedly has gone over and become a Negan. - This will present a huge problem to our heroes once they launch their attacks . Eugene will have helped Negan increase the defenses of Sanctuary and possibly have helped them make their own bullets . <p> Overall , the episode showed that the boring format of the first half of the season will continue during the second half as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show had mad the turn and would focus on the main group of survivors , but sadly this does n't  appear to be the case . The episode focused on Dwight . Dwight . Granted , he does play a pivotal role in the war against Negan in the comic book version of the Walking Dead . However , he has a very long way to go if he is going to get there . <p> But seriously , who cares what happens to Dwight ? He tried to kill everyones favorite survivor , Darryl . When he could n't , he took his signature weapon and car . The only real interest in Dwight would be to see if Darryl gets a chance to finish him off , as he so rightly deserves . Its almost surprising that he show would go back to using full episodes to focus on secondary characters . A lot of these subplots do not have any impact on the worked . Eugene ? He has n't  done anything major except stand around and cry when the walkers show up . <p> This show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible . We need to see the group together and linking arms in solidarity . War is coming and the survivors will be a the frontlines .

@@36129938 @5129938/ <p> Going into this years Oscars there were a couple of persistent questions : Would the Academy be able to correct the #OscarsSoWhite controversy , and how political was the evening the going to get ? The answers were it could , and very , and perhaps the best example was what happened in the last few minutes of the show when the Best Picture winner was announced to be La La Land , only for it to be revealed near the end of the acceptance speech that it was Moonlight that had actually won . In the end , the touching personal drama beat out Hollywoods big wet kiss to itself , one of several pointed and not-so-pointed allusions to the present need to embrace diversity during the evening . <p> One should n't feel too bad for La La Land though , it still scored six Oscars out of its 14 nominations including Best Actress for Emma Stone , Best Director Damien Chazelle and trophies for Best Score , Best Song , Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction . Moonlight did half as well overall with Best Supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney , but perhaps the message will persist more . Indeed , the Best Picture of the Year , despite a misread from Warren Beatty , turned out to be the visceral slice of life of a black boy that grows up poor and fatherless with a crack addicted mother in Miami . La La Land may be about following your hopes and dreams , but Moonlight is about what you do when you have none . <p> If that seems somewhat dour , that was about the tone of the affair at the Dolby Theatre that was epic in its length , and packed with all the usual trappings of these overlong soirees . At this Oscars , it was n't a matter of who 's going to get political , it was a matter of who 's not going to get political ? Host Jimmy Kimmel was the only one to use the initials " D.T. " out loud , but the more subtle messages from presenters and winners was still universally understood . While presenting the Oscars for short and feature length animation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a migrant worker , as a human being , I 'm against any form of wall that separates us . " He then gave the Best Animated Feature Oscar to Zootopia , one of the directors continued the theme . " We are so grateful to the audiences all over the world that embraced this film with this story of tolerance being more powerful than fear of the other , " said Rich Moore . <p> The actions of President Donald Trump were dealt with more directly by the Oscar winners that werent there . " Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear , a deceitful justification for aggression and war , " said Asghar Farhadi in a statement read after his film , The Salesman , won Best Foreign Language Film . Frahadi , who 's Iranian , boycotted the Oscars when the travel ban executive order signed by Trump included his country along with six other majority Muslim countries . <p> " Our organization is guide by a verse from the Quran to save one life is to save all of humanity ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life , to stop the bloodshed in Syria , and around the world , " read a statement from Raed Saleh , the leader of the Nobel Prize-nominated Syrian rescue group that 's the subject of Best Short Documentary , The White Helmets . Khaled Khateeb , the 21-year-old cinematographer who filmed Helmets , was denied entry into the U.S. while trying to attend the Oscars . <p> But Kimmel fired directly at Trump early and often , once he got a bit of mockery at Mel Gibsons expense out of the way first . " People have been telling me it 's time to to bring everyone together . Let 's just get something straight off the top : I ca n't do that . There 's only one Braveheart in this room , and he 's not going to unite us either , " Kimmel said before talking pointedly about the two elephants in the room . " Maybe this is not a popular thing to say , but I want to say thank you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like the Oscars were racist ? It 's gone . Thanks to him ! " <p> To Kimmels credit , he kept the bloated show running rather smoothly right up until the Best Picture snafu . Kimmel was a constant presence throughout the show and did n't  disappear at the halfway point as time ticked on as the presentations and rewards piled up . Maybe the fact that the Oscars at times felt like a formal version of Kimmels talks show had something to do with that . There was an Oscars version of " Mean Tweets " , an excruciatingly long gag where Kimmel brought a Hollywood tour through the auditorium , and more of Kimmels ongoing antagonism with Matt Damon . The Damon bit was fine , but the stupid " Movie I Love the Most " segments turned out to be one long set-up to mock Damons We Bought a Zoo , a movie Matt Damon himself has probably forgot he made . <p> And in the end , if 2017 Oscars will be remembered for nothing else , it will be for these five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertolazzi , Giorgio Gregorini , and Christopher Allen Nelson won for Best Make-Up and Hairstyling . Amanda Waller herself , Viola Davis , won Best Supporting Actress for Fences while Batmans brother Casey Affleck won Best Actor for Manchester By the Sea . Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Themworked its magic on Best Costume Design , The Jungle Book took Best Visual Effects , and Pixar collected another Oscar for Piper , the short animated film that preceded Finding Dory . <p> So that 's the end of another awards season . Like a candy and cookie airdrop the sweetness is gone before you know it , and that 's especially true if your the producer and studio for La La Land . In perhaps the most Trump-like move of the night , Beatty shook our faith in the system because sometimes a 70-something year old man might read something wrong and the whole thing falls apart , and if that 's not a great metaphor for the current political climate , I do n't  know what is .

@@36129946 @5129946/ <p> While it might not be the first franchise that springs to mind when you think about expensive collectibles , Underworld has a longevity that is the envy of many a film series . The first movie was released in 2003 and the fifth instalment , Underworld : Blood Wars , came out earlier this year . There is already a sixth movie underway as well as a television series in discussion , and that 's on top of the comic book adaptations and novelisations of the story . People would n't be going to so much effort if there was n't a devoted audience out there who loved it . Indeed , there is a tight-knit cult following within nerd culture that lives for the history and culture and brutal , bloody battles in the saga of the lycan and vampire clans . <p> The story spans centuries , plunging the audience into the secret war that rages between the two bloodlines , first dropping them into the adventures of Selene , the vampire Death Dealer , played by Kate Beckinsale . From the first moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman physicality . It takes fundamental strings of mythology from the classically fantasy stories of vampires and werewolves and weaves them into a futuristic sci-fi setting , all leaping from skyscrapers , harnessing the power of daylight and blasting enemies with silver bullet guns . <p> The series combines an ancient blood feud with the fire power of a modern day war , with a badass protagonists ' personal vendetta thrown in to create a cinematic experience that " while it undeniably has its flaws " is nonetheless enjoyable . Addictive , even . <p> As tributes to the series , Star Ace has created a number of collectible figures of key characters from the series . Nerd Bastards was lucky enough to get a hands on look at two of them " Kate Beckinsale 's Selene , the protagonist of four of the five Underworld films , and the vampire patriarch Viktor portrayed in the films by Bill Nighy . <p> Both figures are around 30cm tall with many moveable points and hand-painted head sculpts designed to reflect the real life actors who played them as accurately as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression and skin texture . They each come with a meticulously crafted outfit and a handful of iconic accessories from various points in the movies . <p> PACKAGING <p> The packaging is distinctly Underworld , with iconic franchise images on both cases . <p> The dark , brooding faces of Selene and Viktor loom out of their boxes , simultaneously introducing the characters and giving a sense of the stylistic look of the series itself . In particular , the icy cold colouring on the Selene box is very evocative of the darkness in the movies . Viktor 's box has a less chilly look created by earthy red colours instead of blue . The colour choices offer the first hint at the characters ' personalities , with the red flecks reminiscent of Viktor 's fiery anger and the sharp blue drawing attention to Selene 's cool , level-headedness and commitment to embracing the darkness for the greater good . <p> Both boxes are very detailed , with subtle patterns running down the either side of the faces that are easily overlooked except when they catch the light . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small circle of tape over the flap at the top of the box , but otherwise there 's not a lot between you and the figures . The piece of card that provides the background folds around the sides of the plastic casing inside , so you can remove the whole lot in one smooth pull . The figures and all their accessories are held in place between two moulded sheets of plastic . There 's nothing holding the various pieces still inside though , so you need to be careful taking the top layer of plastic off if you do n't want to drop any accessories as it fits quite snugly . It does mean that you can take everything out without damaging the box or even altering the set up very much , as you do n't have any twists or clamshells to deal with . <p> If you really do n't want to go fiddling with stuff , you can display the figures without taking them out at all , as the front of the boxes opens up to reveal the characters through a plastic window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to worry about it flapping open . There 's even another picture of the character on the inside of the door so that big space to side does n't  go to waste and can become a part of your display . <p> The one issue with this is that the backgrounds are quite dark . While it fits with the general feel of the series , the characters are dressed in really dark clothes , so they do n't exactly stand out . Selene , in particular , is dressed in all black so her face and hands stand out really starkly compared to the rest of her body and accessories . <p> Aside from the face on the front and the patterned background that covers the whole box , there is n't much else of interest on the boxes . The back of each box has the basic information you need to know about the figures , but not much else that has any significant design features . The faint vampire emblems beneath the text is a nice touch that gives the boxes a little bit of personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very detailed and is a wonderfully accurate physical representation of the character . The face especially is very true to life , creating a genuinely lifelike representation of the live action counterpart . The hair even falls over one eye the way it does in all of Kate Beckinsale 's promotional photos , including the one on the front of the box . <p> The clothes are very well made . They 're all made of a sturdy and pleasant-feeling material and for the most part are equally as detailed as the facial features . <p> The coat has fine patterns on the back that you have to look closely to really appreciate . It is also well hemmed so that it feels like a real item of outerwear . You can remove it to get a better look at the other clothes underneath and , in doing so , you get a chance to appreciate the quality with which this piece has been crafted . <p> Underneath , the corset Selene wears over her shirt has similarly fine detail in the material itself , as well as intricate stitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . This item of clothing is an incredibly well made piece , being both intricately detailed right down to the tiniest stitches and more accurate than most people would even notice . Its almost a shame that so much of it is hidden by the coat . <p> Beneath that , the figure wears a single piece of black material that covers her whole body . It clings to her like the skin tight clothes she wears in the movies . It works especially well on the legs of the figure , being both tight and flexible . The seams over the shoulders could be smoother . At the neck of the suit , there is a zip , which you can keep up so that the collar is kept closed or pulled down to the corset . <p> The boots are also intricately detailed . They have tiny buckles running along the sides and even creases across toes that make them look like Selene has been running around in them for a while . <p> The figure wears thick wristbands along her forearms , which are held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character 's costume in the movies , but also conveniently hides the way her changeable hands connect to her arms if you choose to display her without her coat and show off the intricacy of the other clothes instead . <p> The figure does n't have the best capability for movement , with the shoulders and hips restricted by the tight clothes . It bends a lot better in the knees and elbows , so it 's certainly not impossible to give the figure a sense of action , though if you bend her knees too far back it looks unnaturally angular . <p> The detail in the Viktor figure has a similarly powerful effect " the level of work that has gone into making his skin look aged and worn is really impressive . His face , torso and hands are all wrinkled and discoloured with age ( Viktor being over 1,500 years old in the movies ) . The skin of his neck hangs in loose folds , his face is lined , jowls droop from his jaw " his many centuries have been finely wrought onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , but also in his face , which has vivid ice cold eyes and even a furrow between his eyebrows as he scowls thoughtfully before him . <p> Viktor 's coat is large enough that it could cover up a lot of the detail on the chest , so it 's worth pulling it open a little so that you can really appreciate how much work has gone into creating that aged torso . However , you ca n't display it without the coat ( or trousers ) as , unlike the Selene figure , the detail does not extend to the rest of the body , with a smooth plastic ball in place of a shoulder . Even if you just want the coat open , you 'll need to be careful how far back you take it otherwise you 'll flash the moving mechanism there which really ruins the impact of the old flesh . <p> This is not only evident in the figure itself , but also in the coat , which is not hemmed as neatly as Selenes coat . <p> The trousers you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach skin ends somewhat abruptly just beneath the brilliantly soft and wrinkled navel . <p> The belt that comes with the figure and its accompanying chain are both nicely detailed and look good breaking up the simplicity of the trousers . <p> Viktor 's coat is made of a similar material to Selene 's . The green of the fabric is mottled to give a more impactful effect than a plain colour , with the golden pattern standing out vividly over the top . The collar in particular is well made , standing up as it does in the film without being unrealistically stiff . <p> The Viktor figure has a similar range of movement to the Selene figure , with limited movement in the hips and shoulders , but easily bendable elbows and knees . Bending Viktor 's knees does n't raise the same issues as you get with the Selene figure , as his trousers are far looser so any unnatural pointiness is well hidden . <p> ACCESSORIES <p> Both figures come with a number of accessories , including a smart , simple stand with the characters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're looking at .

Individually , the pieces work with varying degrees of effectiveness . <p> The two guns fit perfectly into the holsters on Selene 's hips . They fit fairly well into the spare hand shaped to grip them , with a finger even fitting comfortably against the trigger . It 's quite a loose grip , though so it 's likely to slump to the side . If you can angle Selene in just the right way , though , it can still look really cool . <p> The grenade and the throwing star also fit easily into the hands made for them , though the limited movement means that Selene might have to just hold them rather than pose mid-throw . <p> The knife fits into another of the alternate hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really fit into any of the hands .

Rather than being held securely , it is more a matter of balancing it on Selene 's arms than having it properly gripped . That does n't stop it being a very cool accessory , though , and if you 're prepared to spend a bit of time positioning Selene just right it can make for an amazing composition .

There are two small knives , a sword , two alternate hands and two chains . <p> The two small knives fit well into the alternate hands , though the sword has the same issue as the one that comes with the Selene figure , struggling to fit comfortably into the figure 's grip due to the bulky decoration on the end of the hilt . Viktor 's sword is also easy to bend and probably also easy to snap , so it does need to be treated delicately . <p> The chains go around his neck and waist , fitting closely around the figure and hanging well from it . The detail on the vampire elder pendant is very well made , matching the patterns on Viktor 's coat and making for a great recreation of the sacred vampire charm . This not only provides a great little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater story of the series for Viktor and the entire vampire clan . <p> CRITICISM <p> There are n't any glaring flaws in either of these figures that would hold any fans of the franchise back from adding them to a collection . <p> The limitation of movement combined with the loose fit of the accessories in the alternate hands means that your options for poses are restricted . This could cause problems if you 're the kind of collector that likes to have your action figures on display looking like they 're in the heat of battle " especially with the awkwardly pointy knees on the Selene figure . <p> If you do want to display your figure with an accessory , you 'll have to put some time and effort into balancing it in just the right way so that the weapons and alternate hands stay in place , as they can both be somewhat uncooperative . <p> While this could be annoying , it 's not an issue that 's rare even among the best made action figures and is far from a deciding factor when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in all , these figures are both extremely impressive . They 're incredibly detailed , very accurate and come with a lot of accessories . Both are very accurate when compared to their movie counterparts , showing off the great care and skill that goes into creating these pieces . <p> Really , the only flaws that are at all noticeable are only a problem when they 're grouped together . If you 're happy to have your figure in a more relaxed pose , or even displayed in the box with its accessories by its side , then they 're basically non-existent . <p> Both figures are great to look at and only get better when you look closely at all the tiny details , making them ideal collectors items for anyone who really values craftsmanship . A lot of the intricacies are very subtle " there 's only so much you expect , for instance , from an outfit that is all one colour , and yet Selene 's ensemble is better crafted than a lot of the clothes made for real people . Equally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfections around his fingernails " can only be fully appreciated up close . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804 
@@36129948 @5129948/ <p> A persons choice of cosplay can tell you a lot about the person beneath the costume . It can give you an idea of the kind of movies they watch and books they read and games they play . You can guess the sort of characters that inspire or intrigue them , the kind of aesthetics they 're drawn to not to mention , their creative skills and style . When someones cosplay repertoire is as well crafted and as diverse as that of Laura , known to her followers as Taisie Cosplay , its safe to assume there 's someone really interesting beneath the twisted Cheshire grin . <p> We took some time to talk to Laura to find out more about what drives her creativity . <p> PC or Mac ? <p> Oh always Mac , I have just got a new MacBook Pro for my birthday . I was using a PC and it always feels right . <p> What is your favourite cereal ? <p> This is a hard one cause I many favourite cereals but at the moment its a toss up between Cheerios and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - <p> Ha , I would n't say I have a favourite curse word . I do say shit a lot but I do love using words like idiot and prat . <p> If you could pick a world from any video game , where would you live ? <p> I would love to live in Hyrule . The Legend of Zelda series has always been a long favourite of mine and would think I would fit in very nicely in the castle grounds . <p> What fictional character from movies , comics , TV or video games have you secretly crushed on ? <p> Oh I have had many a crush on movie and TV characters . I think my most recent had to be Tom Milson version of Ichabod Crane from Sleepy Hollow . <p> What got you into cosplaying ? <p> I got into it through a friend of mine , she messaged me asking if I wanted to come along to a comic con for a day , which happened to be MCM in London . She knew I was always a fan of costumes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so shy and did n't  really know how to pose but as the day went on I got more into it and by the end of the day I could n't wait until the next convention . <p> What was the first character you ever cosplayed ? <p> I remember being told by my friend that she was going to cosplay Alice from American Mcgees Alice : Madness Returns and I immediately said that I was going to be the Cheshire Cat . I spend the next couple of weeks painting , with the help of my mum , a ribcage , bones and building a tail for the Cosplay . I felt so proud that I had managed to pull of this Cosplay and couldnt wait to wear it . <p> How did it feel going out in cosplay for the first time ? <p> I had to travel on the tube to the con for my first time in full costume so it did feel very strange as loads of people were looking at me . At the con I was mega shy and did n't  know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the ropes . <p> How does it compare to how you feel showing off new cosplays now ? <p> I 'm so much more confident now , cosplaying is like second nature to me now and I do research on the characters I cosplay so I feel confident on how to pose and act . I love showing off my new cosplays and feel proud when people say they are awesome . <p> What do you think of that first cosplay now ? <p> I still love my first cosplay and have worn a couple more times . My skills , knowledge and techniques have grown so much since then so I feel that my choices as a cosplayer have improved greatly . <p> When did you realise you were first getting noticed as a cosplayer ? How did it make you feel ? <p> I remember being featured in a Sneaky Zebra cosplay music video and getting so excited that we made the cut . A friend of mine told me recently that I was the reason he started cosplaying which made me feel so honoured and humbled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump out at you as something you have to cosplay ? <p> I think it would be a number of things , I have to love that character I would never cosplay someone that I did n't  know or like . I do n't  always go with characters that look like me but sometimes if they are like me personality wise I cant help myself . I think I can see me cosplaying a lot of Disney characters in the future , I have always been a Disney child and really want to bring them to life . <p> What 's your most memorable con experience ? <p> I remember at LFCC two girls came up to me asking for a photo , what makes it memorable is that they incorporated their hijab into their cosplays . I thought it was so clever and it did n't  stop them from cosplay their favourite characters . <p> What 's your favourite character to cosplay ? <p> I love cosplaying Snow White , I love the reaction of children who come up to me . For them I am that character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting them is the sweetest thing . <p> If you actually had to live as one of the characters you 'd cosplayed , which one would it be ? <p> I would probably like to live like Jubliee , she does n't  have the greatest of powers but she is sassy and strong willed . She also have a huge family of mutants that support her and who would n't want to live in that school . <p> What 's the most difficult cosplay you 've ever done ? <p> I would have to say that it would be a toss up between my Chun Li and Kitana . They may seem to look like easy cosplays but I had to adapt a patterns , work with puffed sleeves and materials that I had never encountered before . I had YouTube and Google a lot because I was so new to making things from scratch . <p> Have you ever given up on a cosplay idea because it was too difficult ? <p> Oh yes I signed up to be part of a black lantern group as Hawk Girl . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was incredibly hard for me in the time limit to get it finished . I was get so stressed out with I decided that I would just give up the idea . Lucky for me the group was cancelled so I was n't letting anyone down . <p> Some of your cosplays are incredibly detailed . Do you find that the more intricate pieces are more rewarding when they 're finished ? <p> Yes , definitely the more work goes that goes into the costume , the more proud I am of finishing it . I 'm finding now that I feel more confident in my skills that I can try harder things . <p> What is the most effort you 've put into creating a single small detail ? <p> On one of my newest cosplays Aurora from Sleeping Beauty , I did a version where half my dress was pink and half was blue and I have to overlock all the edges on to the dress . I would say it took a good week of solid 4/5 hours work to get it finished . <p> You often plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How far in advance do you have to plan ahead for that ? <p> Depending on what cosplays I 'm doing . If its a new cosplay then I would plan at least a year in advance so I have enough time to make them . My friend and I have already planned for next year 's conventions but sometimes things change and I have had to use old cosplays with only weeks to spare . <p> Where do you keep all your cosplays once you 've worn them ? What do you do with the bulkier accessories ? <p> I keep my cosplays in boxes under my bed and under my sewing table . My dresses I have hung up behind my door in my sewing room . I do n't  really have any bulky cosplays or props but I have a cupboard that has all my accessories including swords , prop guns and shoes . <p> Are you working on anything new now ? <p> I have loads of things planned like Roger Rabbit with a fur head and Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric for Belles ball gown and I 'm hoping to start work on skull kid from Legend of Zelda : Majoras Mask very soon which will be my biggest and most detailed cosplay I have ever done . <p> What are your favourite materials to work with ? <p> I love working with fabric . Cottons , brocade , silks . Anything that can give a lovely finish to my costumes . I also love Worbla to work with and have used it many times in the past . <p> Do you like to find professional arts supplies or do you prefer to work with household items ? <p> Its a bit of a mixture , sometimes I would search out for professional things that I know will work well but sometimes good old PVA glue and kitchen roll works wonders . I have used this method many times on many costumes . <p> What is the most unusual or unexpected thing you 've used as part of a cosplay ? <p> I used florist foam for my Chun Lis wrist spikes but they did n't  last very long . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tink wings but had to give up because I ran out of time . <p> Are there any characters you 're looking forward to cosplaying in the future ? <p> I cant wait to cosplay Belle , she has been my favourite Disney princess since I was little . I just hope I can do her justice . I 'm also looking forward to cosplaying Sarah from HocusPocus with a group in the future . <p> Who are your favourite cosplayers working right now ? <p> I follow a lot of Yayas work , I love her detail and different takes on characters . I also love Kamui Cosplay , I wish I could be as crafty with Worbla as she is . I 'm so impressed with a lot of my fellow cosplayer friends , their work is incredible and attention to detail is everything . <p> What 's your favourite thing about the cosplaying community ? <p> I love how friendly people and supportive they can be . I often ask question about what fabrics to use it or what 's the best techniques and I will always get helpful responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved ? <p> I hate people who body shame , I have experienced this in past and its a horrible thing to have to go through . I would love the community to be able to accept the idea that people can cosplay whoever they want no matter what size they are and not have to worry what other people think of them . <p> Outside of cosplaying , what do you like to do with your time ? <p> I love singing and I regularly go to karaoke nights with friends . I also have to keep my hands busy , I have a bad case of what I call restless hands and always have to have some sort of project on the go at the moment I 'm working on an Alice in Wonderland cross stitch . <p> Do you think you 'll still be cosplaying in ten years ' time ? Do you have any goals , in cosplaying terms or otherwise ? <p> I would hope I will be still cosplaying in 10 years , its my favourite hobby and I hope to continue . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never been confident enough to even think about starting anything that detailed and also I really hope to start commissioning work soon . <p> Do you have any advice for aspiring cosplayers ? <p> Do n't  be scared to cosplay , do characters that you love . Do n't  let people tell you that you cant . Its a great community to be a part of , the conventions are a great way to meet new people who are into the same things as you . Most of all have fun , enjoy yourself and be proud of your character whether you made it or bought it . <p> Special thanks to Laura for taking the time to talk to us .

@@36129952 @5129952/ <p> Last year , - Daredevil smashed into the hearts of fans with bone-cracking intensity . This pitch perfect , character driven action fest put to rest any lingering phantom pains from the 2003 Ben Affleck vehicle . This year , - Daredevil- is back with a second season , looking to outdo the first in every way . And it succeeds on most counts . The acting seems a little more solid from all three returning main characters , the action scenes are more brutal and explosive than in the first season , and there just seem to be more great individual moments in season 2 overall , especially considering the brilliant additions of- Elektra and- the Punisher , played by- Elodie Yung and Jon Bernthal , respectively . This article is written in celebration of those moments and the return of the Man Without Fear . So turn off your police scanners , pour yourself a martini with a nasty grey olive , and pull up a chair to count down the 10 best scenes in- Daredevil season 2 ! Fair warning : SPOILERS AHEAD ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , a scene from the last episode first . Go ahead and call your mommy if you cant handle it , because its gon na be that kind of article . Some might say that season 2 of- Daredevil fell prey to the same problems that seem to plague the world-building second outings for members of the- Marvel Cinematic Universe . As with- Iron Man 2- and- Avengers : Age of Ultron , there may have been times where season 2 of- Daredevil sacrificed the needs of the immediate story in favor of setting up the future of the franchise , especially with the six or so epilogues at the end of Episode 13 . One place where this world-building really worked however , was when Foggy met with- Jessica Jones Jeri Hogarth in what was essentially the closing of his season 2 story-line ( poor- Elden Henson did n't  have a whole lot to do for the latter part of the season ; he was the Thor ) . First of all , its just great watching- Carrie-Anne Moss do anything . Aside from that , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvels- Netflix series . Sure , - Rosario Dawsons Claire Temple popped up in- Jessica Jones , but making Foggy a partner at the same law firm as Hogarth ( who was the attorney for Heroes for Hire in the comics ) sets up the framework for what will eventually be- The Defenders . This scene is just packed with kinetic potential . <p> 2 . Daredevil and Elektra Fight Ninjas Episode 8 <p> Despite the fact that " Daredevil and Elektra Fight Ninjas " could be a scene from about 1/3 of the episodes in season 2 , this scene at the beginning of episode 8 is special for a couple reasons . Its the first scene where we really see Daredevil fighting a swarm of ninjas , which has been a long time coming for fans of the comics . It is also the beginning of the end for Daredevils code of ethics . By the end of the season , he s still not okay with killing people himself , but he s not necessarily opposed to it if someone else does it , but hell do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His code gets pretty foggy pretty quickly in the next couple of episodes , but this scene is just pure , unadulterated ninja fightin and its glorious . Not to mention that at the end of it , Stick makes his return to Daredevils already complicated life , and who does n't  love that salty old bastard ? <p> 3 . The Prison Fight Episode 9 <p> Daredevil has had a lot of incredible fight scenes . A lot . They have been brutal and intense in a way that no other franchise in the MCU can match . This scene with the Punisher outpaces any of those scenes by leaps and bounds . Shanking people , gouging eyes out , and slashing throats open , Frank Castle disembowels traditional superhero " grittiness " and makes a scarf with its intestines . Many of the Punishers fights are disturbing in a way Daredevils cant match and this scene is the apex of that . In addition to the brutality of this fight , it adds to the larger social commentary that Marvel is great at letting add depth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as expansive as- Daredevil Season 1 : Age of Gentrification , but it does examine our acceptance of a deeply flawed justice system that places no emphasis on rehabilitation , but seems only to breed and foster even more hardened criminals . This is what leads Daredevil to kind of maybe being okay with killing people . <p> 4 . Daredevil Offers His Life to Elektra Episode 12 <p> This is Daredevil at his best . When Elektra finds out that she 's the Black Sky and that she could take her position at the head of The Hand , Daredevil walks his throat into her sword and tells her to go ahead and kill him because " He is the enemy of The Hand . " The situation is clear to him . There 's no ambiguity . He opposes The Hand and if she is going to be a part of that cult , then she will have to kill him . This unwavering integrity is the crux of Daredevil . He stands for what he stands for , even if its not easy , even if it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of ethics to take the easy way out . He cares so much about Elektra that he offers his life to make crystal clear the two paths before her . <p> 5 . Daredevil and Karen Page Kiss Episode 4 <p> Sure , - Charlie Cox and Elodie Yung have a lot of chemistry . They work really well together . Yeah , yeah , that 's great . But what fans have really been waiting for , since the very first episode of- Daredevil- season 1 , is for Matt Murdock and Karen Page to get together . For almost seventeen episodes , the tension and attraction between them has been palpable and fans have been waiting for Murdock to make a move with this woman whose tenacity and desire for truth and justice rival his own . This scene perfectly captures what it is to fall for someone and act on it for the first time . Everything else falls away , the traffic , the noise , the rain . Murdock focuses on a single raindrop as it lands and rolls down Pages arm . He s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The scene does a great job of building the anticipation of sharing a kiss that you 've waited too long for and in doing so creates a kind of nostalgia for all first kisses past . Besides , how can you watch this show and not fall in love with- Deborah Ann Woll at least a little bit ? <p> 6 . Punishers Cemetery Monologue Episode 4 <p> No one cried during this scene . There was no crying . No , none at all . Shut up , YOURE crying ! What an intense , touching scene and what a great performance by Jon Bernthal . Dolph Lundgren , Thomas Jane , and Ray Stevenson all did fine jobs as the Punisher , but none of them came anywhere close to getting inside the character like Bernthal has . This iteration of the Punisher is the first one that makes sense as a living , breathing person and Bernthal introduces us to him in gut-wrenching detail . When a scene can make you appreciate what you have and feel like an idiot for taking it for granted even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 7 . Daredevil Meets with Wilson Fisk Episode 10 <p> What a fantastic surprise was- Vincent DOnofrio popping up in season 2 of- Daredevil ? - His character work is still unsurpassed in the entirety of the MCU and watching him interact with Daredevil and the Punisher was a highlight of this season . It was also nice to see Fisk go against Murdock , not as his superhero alter ego , but as his mild mannered self . This scene starts out with a bit of a chess match as Murdock tries to get information about Castles escape and throw Fisk off balance , while Fisk plays innocent , even passive-aggressively saying that New York is out of his hands now , implying that Murdock is to blame for the downward spiral of Hells Kitchen . Ultimately , Murdock threatens Fisks love , Vanessa , and Fisk explodes , revealing that he is in fact running things in the prison and gaining power . This realization further erodes Murdocks faith in what he s doing and his nonlethal methods . <p> 8 . The Punisher Kills The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle really becomes the Punisher . Sure , he s been ruthlessly killing people all season , but aside from a mostly aimless mission to find out what happened to his family , he was lost , just waiting to die , really . This is when he chooses to become the Punisher . Karen Page is there to give him the choice to rise up from the level of killers and become a hero , telling him that if he kills The Blacksmith , hell become the monster that everyone says he is and that hell be dead to her . He does n't  even hesitate to respond , " I 'm already dead " and set about literally killing The Blacksmith and symbolically killing Frank Castle . His transformation is complete . In the cemetery scene mentioned in a previous entry , the Punisher says that when he came home from the war his house was just as he left it , like it had been waiting for him . Since his family was killed , he had n't  been back to his house and once again it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returns to burn the house down . It neednt wait any longer , because Frank Castle is never coming home from war . <p> 9 . The One-Shot Fight Scene Episode 3 <p> One-shot scenes have become increasingly popular as a more sophisticated audience can appreciate , not only the end product of what goes up on the screen , but also the technical aspect of how it got there . Reminiscent of the famous fight scene from- the Korean film- Oldboy , one of the most memorable scenes from the first season of- Daredevil- was a one-shot scene in which an injured Daredevil stumbles into the lair of the Russian mob to rescue a kidnapped little boy . As the performers play out the wonderfully choreographed sequence , the camera moves in and out around them allowing the stuntmen and actors to swap in and out seamlessly as the characters knock each other into and out of rooms . This season , seeking to outdo itself , - Daredevil creates an even more impressive sequence as Daredevil , fresh from being chained up by the Punisher ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight through an entire biker gang to escape a building with a chain still hanging from one arm and a gun taped to the other like he s playing a demented fratboy drinking game of Edward .357-Hands .

Perhaps not as impressive as the one-shot scene from the first season of- True Detective , but that bar may be set impossibly high . <p> 10 . Daredevil Chained Up By The Punisher Episode 3 <p> When it was first announced that the Punisher would be a part of season 2 , some fans ( in particular , the one writing this very article ) immediately began hoping that their favorite scene from the comics would be included in the show .

Not only was the scene included in the show , but it became an entire episode . Even though this scene is chopped up and revisited throughout the episode , it still counts as one scene . This is where Daredevil and the Punisher really get to argue their philosophies and some of the best character work of the series is done . The Punisher expresses how ridiculous Daredevils self-imposed boundaries are in a world that has none . Daredevil explains the sanctity of human life , how there is always hope for people to make better decisions and how no one has the ability to judge another worthy of life or death . The scene comes to a climax at the end when the Punisher brings out a criminal and gives Daredevil his impossible choice . When Daredevil asks " What kind of choice is that ? " the Punisher responds with a line lifted straight from the comic book , " The kind I make every time I pull the trigger . " <p> What do you think of this list ?

What started as a time travel slasher movie in 1984 became one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood , and despite numerous attempts to keep the gravy train going Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines , Terminator : Salvation , and Terminator : Genisys Hollywood just cant seem to make Terminator work , at least not without its creator . Perhaps that why there 's news tonight that James Cameron is plotting a Terminator comeback , and he s bring a special new friend along with him . <p> In a report from Deadline , its been revealed that Cameron is working on a reboot and conclusion to the movie series he started 33 years ago . What exactly that will look like is to be determined . These are very early days and the details are thin , but the unexpected news is that Cameron already has a director lined up and its Deadpool helmer Tim Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new movie with Miller taking point because Cameron , as you know , has about 84- Avatar- sequels in development . <p> So how and why has all this come about ? Well , according to Camerons original Terminator agreement when he sold the idea to producer ( and future ex-wife ) Gale Anne Hurd , certain rights to the story are to revert back to Cameron once the original film turns 35 , which is coming up in 2019 . David Ellison , whose Skydance Productions funded Genisys , currently holds the rights , and will hold on to some still after 2019 . Evidently Ellison is part of the new endeavour , scouting perspective stories for the new- Terminator- adventure with top flight science fiction authors . <p> So this is kind of exciting , but how serious is the attempt and did we learn anything from that whole Genisys experiment ? Sure , least years attempted reboot did n't  even make $90 million at the domestic box office , but it did make $350 million in foreign ticket sales , which is almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign box office take of $373 million . So the case can be made that there 's still some juice in this franchise . Adding Cameron back into the mix will only sweeten the deal since the director added his endorsement to Genisys , the only one of the Terminators not made by Cameron to get his seal of approval . So image what it will do to the box office if his names in the credits <p> Well have more news about this project as it comes in , but in the mean time a 3D version of Terminator 2 : Judgement Day is expected to be released in theatres sometime this summer . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

@@36130041 @5130041/ <p> The idea of time travel is not a new concept in science fiction , and neither is the idea of someone or someones from the future coming back to the present to change fate . Travelers was already walking well-worn ground long before it was a glimmer in the eye of creator Brad Wright , let alone seeing it premiere in the same TV year as 11.22.63 , 12 Monkeys , and the new NBC series Timeless . If Travelers is to succeed , it has a couple of key things going for it , one is Wright who more or less created the Stargate TV empire , and the other is the conceit that our titular time travelers are forced to lead double lives as they try to save their future . <p> Travelers ' set-up is very simply : the future hundreds of years hence is utterly terrible . The surviving humans looking down the barrel at their own extinction have found a way to send a person 's consciousness back in time where it can override the mind of someone living in the year 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes over the old OS of the person in the present thus allowing future people to take over our bodies here and now , but there 's a moral conundrum because time travel basically means killing someone in the past , so how do you choose ? <p> The show resolves that neatly by having the future humans do their homework and download into someone mere moments before they die . The point is made inelegantly in the pilot as we meet our main characters , and we see them in the minutes leading up to their death with a convenient countdown clock showing us when this person is about to kick it exactly . Then , as if my magic , that person avoids their fall , drug overdose , or ill-timed blow to the head just in the knick of time . The way the arrival scenes are shot , I think the average sci-fi fan would have picked up on what was going on just fine without the whole countdown clock , which seemed superfluous and dorky , especially give that- Travelers- wants to been seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first episode though was really its clunkiest part as the script grinds out how each of the four-member team of Travelers arrive in the present . There 's high school athlete Trever ( Jared Abrahamson ) , library janitor Marcy ( MacKenzie Porter ) , recreational drug user Philip ( Reilly Dolman ) , and stay at home mom Carly ( Nesta Cooper ) . We never see the future they come from , but the actors are allowed these subtle cues to indicate just how foreign the present Earth must be as compared to what 's assumed to be the charbroiled hellscape they come from . An apple is a delicious delicacy , to be outside in the sunlight is a tropical vacation . <p> For added difficulty , the nature of the time travel in Travelers means our heroes have to lead double lives : the one where they work towards a better future , and their lives as people in the present , working jobs , looking after children , and interacting with friends and family they 're supposed to have known for years . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Twitter , Pinterest , and all your favourite social media distractions . Apparently , in the centuries to come , all our little jokes and pictures will paint a picture for a spy from the future to take over our lives , and as you might expect , that 's as precarious as it sounds . Fake profiles , secret problems , and missing information all plague the Travelers immediate arrival in the present , and gives the series a fascinating new subtext to explore over the long haul . <p> We do n't get too deep into the mission in this first hour , or how this ragtag group and their covers are supposed to change the wheel of fate , and , in that way , Travelers is kind of refreshing . Wright , as a writer , as always seemed more interested in world-building than character building ; the pilots of SG-1 , Atlantis , and even Universe seemed far more concerned about the whys and hows and whatfors , and Universe was supposedly built to be more character-centric in the first place . All we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the future sucks and our gaggle of time travelers is meant to change that . <p> Another holdover from Wright 's Stargate days is building a cast of unknowns around a well-known and established veteran , and in this case that 's Eric McCormack as FBI Agent Grant MacLaren . Perhaps it 's a spoiler to say that MacLaren is the final member of the group to arrive seeing as how McCormack spends most of the hour playing original OS agent , but the advertising 's been pretty clear that MacLaren is himself a Traveler . It 's problematic and interesting at the same time , because while we do n't get much of a sense of the character McCormack will be playing in the other 11 episodes of the first season and ( maybe ) beyond , it might be fun to see first hand how well future MacLaren plays the present day FBI agent . <p> What the pilot does n't do is explain why the characters would n't just ditch their normal lives and commit themselves fully to the cause . Sure , having an FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would a paycheque from a day job , but you mean to tell me that the tech wizards of the future could n't come up with an idea for a bottomless debit card or something . It 's not a huge deal , but the people they take over were supposed to have died anyway , so why keep going about life as normal , when normally life would have ended ? <p> Another hiccup in the show 's DNA is the rather cliched things some of the characters encounter . For instance , Carly 's alpha-male abusive husband , as it turns out , is actually a policeman . I wonder if he 's going to learn too much about the Travelers and become an annoyance ? Another annoyance , is the typically excellent Ian Tracey , who appears as Phillip 's lawyer who instantaneously becomes a thorn in his client 's side when Philip pulls a Biff Tannen and gives the degenerate gambler that days pony race results as a way to raise bail money . It seems weird to give the Travelers such- prosaic problems when saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , but maybe these developments will play out in unexpected ways . <p> Despite those reservations , Travelers might be one of the most ambitious and down to earth time travel shows on television , and there 's virtually no chance that the heroes will be asked to stop and see the destruction of the Hindenberg , or go to Washington on the day of Lincoln 's assassination . There 's a strong chance for social commentary too , and more than a little intrigue as the Travelers discover that social media ai n't all it 's cracked up to be . And maybe there 's a lesson in there for us too . The real lesson from episode one of Travelers though is that there 's potential here , and it also has the pedigree to be a great , new fan sensation . <p> Travelers premieres October 17 on Showcase in Canada , and around the world on Netflix later this year . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

@@36130060 @5130060/ <p> I remember riding home from the movie theatre on my bike one warm July evening in 1999 . I had seen The Blair Witch Project , and I was more than a little aware of my surroundings in an above average capacity . There were no woods along my route home , but let 's be honest , danger can come from anywhere , to anyone , even three kids shooting a movie in rural Maryland . I 've always considered ones ability to buy what TheBlair Witch Project was selling as directly tied to how well their imagination could stretch , but no matter how elastic something is , it must inevitably snap back . To wit : Blair Witch . <p> Now horror fans have been tremendously blessed this year , and not just by original works like The Witch or Do n't  Breath ; even sequels like The Conjuring 2 and The Purge : Election Year have managed to mix it up while still staying true to their core . The promise of Blair Witch , the first direct sequel to The Blair Witch Project , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not . Reasonably , seeing his name on the movie poster after the likes of Youre Next and The Guest , should we not expect something more than what 's essentially a remake of the 99 film ? Apparently not . <p> Having said that though , its an extremely well-made and effective remake . Wingard and writer Simon Barrett bring their customary humour to the affair , and Wingard clearly knows how to make something scary . He also understands the lessons of The Blair Witch Project , that if the conceit of found footage is to work then the camera ca n't be omnipresent and capture every little detail . For the audience , like the hapless kids on screen , the frightening part is in not completely understanding the danger , only being able to see it in glimpses and hear it in the noises nearby and letting your mind fill in the details . That 's scary ! <p> So all things being equal , Blair Witch is a great cover of the original movie , or a great movie in its own right if that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perfect sequel in that it does everything the first movie did but bigger , louder and with more money . Plus , more cameras ! Hurray for digital technology because now everybody going into the Black Hills Forrest can have their own ear piece camera as well as a top of the line pro-sumer DSLR and even a drone ! The conceit is still the same though , a group of young people go into the woods to make a documentary , but there 's personal stakes : one of the kids is trying to find out what happened to his sister , one of the people from the original film crew . <p> Wingard assembled a perfectly photogenic group of young people to play the kids . You have James ( James Allen McCune ) , who 's the one in search of answers ; Peter ( Brandon Scott ) , his best friend ; Ashley ( Corbin Reid ) Peters girlfriend ; and Lisa ( Callie Hernandez ) , the aspiring documentarian . Along the way we encounter Lane ( Wes Robinson ) and Talia ( Valorie Curry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ride . Curry may be the most recognizable of the cast thanks to two years as a serial killer acolyte on Foxs The Following , so at least shes got experience , but Blair Witch does n't  really test anyones thespian toolkit beyond screaming and running . <p> The shame of it is that Wingard seems to and one point had an idea where he could have taken the concept of the Blair Witch in strange new directions . For example , along with the genuine humour that comes out of seeing the kids joke around and interact with each other on that carefree first day in the woods , there 's a moment where Wingard toys with the idea that the whole haunted woods affair is a blatant fraud perpetuated by the locals . That could have lead to some interesting twists as the audience is forced as ask if the whole Blair Witch thing was phony in the first place , and playing into the real life ad campaign from 99 that was created to make you think it was actually real . As the kids felt comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt comfortable that Wingard was really going to screw with my head in the back half of the movie . Alas , it was not meant to be . <p> Instead , the director goes right back to what you would expect as the kids hear more noises in the woods , catch glimpses of weird things with their stylish camera ear pieces that never seem to run out of battery power , and encounter easy bake weirdness in the form of stick men and rock piles . Wingard ratchets up the tension as night falls and never seems to go away , but without the grungy , indie authenticity of the 99 Blair Witch , the foreboding does n't  stay with you . In the end , Wingard has thrown so much at you that you just want it to be over . And as you 're told at the beginning of the film , this footage was found abandoned , so the fate our new film friends is pretty much written on the wall in bloody handprints . <p> If the test of a scary movie though is whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds at that much because there were a couple of good bumps along the way . I credit that to Wingards skill as a movie craftsman that in spite of the movies problems with structure and plot , it can at least still hit you directly on the nerve endings a couple of times . On the flipside , craft is the problem with Blair Witch , there 's too much of it . Like with the found footage inheritors of the first Blair Witch , in the back of your mind is the fact that you 're watching actors who are alive and well . Its a product . A product made with skill , but a product just the same . <p> Perhaps to Wingard goes the credit that he did n't  think himself more clever than the original filmmakers , which was the fault of Book of Shadows : Blair Witch 2 , the sequel no one wants to talk about even though it featured a cast of genuinely talented actors led by Jeffrey Donovan , and was directed by an award-winning documentary filmmaker in Joe Berlinger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with being meta-textual and because it was being made on a egg timer it was somewhat inevitable that Shadows- became a mess . Wingard learned better , I guess .

Sometimes , though , it can be hard to scale just how big it is until you 're able to compare it to a number or other unit of measurement .

Furthermore , The Force Awakens was released on Blu-ray in April . As of today , its sold well over 5 million units domestically .

" When I pressed the button , as per the script , it was supposed to chase the villain in a very straightforward way , but Burt sped out of control and went off the pier and into the ocean , " West added . " We had to get him out with a net . " <p> " We tried so hard to get rid of him , but we didt do it , and I think that 's a great tribute to his persistence , " West said with a laugh . <p> Other remembrances included Ward recalling how his old friend , neighbour and sparring partner Bruce Lee filmed his first on-screen fight for the Batman/Green Hornet crossover episode , and how , unlike recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw so that all the good guys could still look good . West , meanwhile , politely declined an offer to do the Batusi because he couldnt do it without the cape and cowl .

" Vincent Price- as Egghead was fun because Adam and I had the chance to get into this gigantic egg fight , " Ward said gleefully . " As a kid I always got into trouble for throwing eggs , but then i got paid to throw eggs .

Ross , after all , became the Red Hulk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Timing , is the reason said one of the Russos to ComicBook.com . <p> " We had so many characters in that movie as it was . We consider everything , obviously , but with so many characters in that movie as it was to try and entertain adding another character and to get to the Red Hulk , you have to add a back story , " Joe Russo explained . " You have to substantiate the narrative to get to that . Thaddeus Ross , on our list of priorities , he was there sort of as the governments agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix . We spent the last six to eight months crafting stories around the cornucopia of characters at our disposal so anything is possible . " <p> So that leaves the door open to a future Red Hulk appearance , but let 's consider this , an aspect to the comic book Civil War that was obviously left out of the movie one : Spider-Mans Iron Spider suit . " Again , that falls in that category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Russo . <p> Speaking of Spider-Man , the brothers were asked about their thoughts on the upcoming solo Spider-Man , which is probably fairly important to them given the fact that they won high praise for rebooting the character in Civil War . So what do they think ? " I think the tone and the direction that Jon Wattss heading in that movie are fantastic , " said Joe Russo . " I think it has the potential to be the best Spider-Man yet , and I know that 's saying a lot because perhaps my favorite comic book movie of all time is Sam Raimis Spider-Man 2 . " <p> That 's a lot to put on the shoulders of Homecoming director Watts , but they say he s more than up to the job . " Joe and I love him . We think he s an incredibly talented filmmaker , super bright guy , " said Anthony Russo . " He s crazy talented , the script is amazing , and we have really high expectations for the movie .

It follows the buddy movie tropes to perfection ; the path from arch-rivals to bosom buddies is well-worn , but it can still delight. - <p> In addition , there was a dark undercurrent to the film as well , which may likely go over the heads of small children , but for their parents it adds fascinating shade . Albert Brooks voices Tiberius , a hawk that helps Maxs friends , particularly his would-be girlfriend Gidget ( voiced by Jenny Slate ) , track the pooch across the city , but Tiberius is clearly aware that he can , and frankly wants to , eat just about any other member of the fellowship . Snowballs rebellion makes some human resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats , dogs , pigs , rodents , snakes , lizards and spiders .

The silliness of singing sausages ( an unintentional plug for- Sausage Party coming later this summer ? ) , got the kids chuckling , but the adults were laughing harder at the implicit meaning . In the next scene though , we get Dukes sad back story , and although- Cheney and- Renaud are either unwilling or unable to hit the emotional high notes that Pixar could reach given similar material , it was a reminder that- Pets- is grounded in something more than the desire to be wacky. - <p> Special credit goes to the voice cast . Louis C.K . and Stonestreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical trap of animated films by playing the characters big . Part of the reason for that is because Pets- does n't  make the story all about- Max Vs Duke , and although Dukes kind of a jerk in the beginning , the script does n't  let Max get away with being a bigger jerk to Duke in return once he gets the upper hand . Its a nice lesson for the kids out there that being mean to someone that 's mean to you is not a good strategy for life . <p> Of course the real star of this thing is Snowball . Voiced by Hart with maniac gleefulness and an animal inferiority complex at levels not seen since The Brain from- Animaniacs , expect Snowball to be a star on par with the Minions , the subject of future short films and other spin-offs . Snowball is the perfect marriage of visual and voice talent , and while the other main characters have to be more reserved , Hart gets to chew the animated scenery with Snowballs big buck teeth . Whether it was his lament for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flushed Pets " , or gleefully chasing down Max and Duke for their betrayal of the cause , you cant say that Hart is n't having a great time in the large fuzzy feet of Snowball . <p> Aside from the zany though , the real pleasure of- The Secret Lives of Pets- may be in recognizing their own pets behaviour in the on-screen characters .

@@36130120 @5130120/ <p> A recent TV ad promoted- The Purge : Election Year- as being the one that " trumps " the two previous- Purge- movies . Message received . In this election year that has shattered any and all expectations in terms of what 's allowed , what 's politically correct , and the commodification of the anger of the electorate , - The Purge : Election Year- is the perfect anecdote . Writer/director James DeMonaco takes the series he started to its logical , and almost satirical conclusion by phrasing the latest film in a way that a lot of politicos can identify with : can the problems of America be resolved by revelling in its anger and bitterness ? Not to mention its desire to dress up in costumes and kill people. - <p> After 2013s- The Purge , which was an isolationist horror movie , 2014s- The Purge : Anarchy- opened up the world by phrasing it like- Death Wish- if Charles Bronsons- Paul Kersey waited for Purge night to get vengeance only to discover the value of life amidst the carnage around him . For a movie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people , it was bizarrely hopefully in the end when Leo Barnes ( Frank Grillo ) decides not to Purge and kill the man that accidentally killed his son . For even during the Purge , there is grace . <p> Election Year- looks ahead several years after that with the rise of upstart Senator Charlie Roan ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) , who lost her entire family in a Purge 15 years earlier and is now running for President on a platform to repeal the Purge . Leo , having gotten his life back together , is now Roans head of security , and with Purge night approaching , he s bound and determined to make sure the senator stays safe and out of the hands of Purgers , which is a problem made more difficult when , for the first time , members of the government are declared- fair game during the Purge . You think the establishment is trying to get this rogue candidate bucking the system out of the way ? <p> DeMonaco lays it on pretty thick with the political allegory , and that 's either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , in another life I write about politics , so I was down for a mostly self-aware journey into the belly our collective disappointment with government authority and power . Subtextually , the idea of Americas rich and powerful using the Purge to eliminate the poor and powerless is intriguing , and while that extremist fantasy of a truth that 's fairly evident , its just too bad that DeMonaco is more concerned with the pageantry of the Purge than subtilely poking at this very compelling concept he s created . <p> On the bright side , that pageantry is vividly and wonderfully realized thanks in no small part to favourable budgetary bump that comes from being a successful series . Strong ideas , like seeing people participate in Roman-like gladiator blood sports , and strong scenes , like the poetically disturbing sight of a woman humming " Wont You Call Be Sweetheart " while sitting on a bus bench next to her husbands burning body , keeps things interesting . On top of that , there 's a thrill of watching all the right people get their comeuppance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Purge as a chance to be vindictive and horrible for no damn good reason . <p> Grillo remains a compelling lead for this series as Leo who makes a rare horror movie leap and has evolved in character between films . He s found something to throw all his training and expertise into and that 's save the Senator from a whole city full of people that want her dead on the one night of the year they can make it happen legally . Grillo and Mitchell have an interesting chemistry as two hard cases who are stubborn in their own ways , and its kind of interesting to see his pessimism and her optimism collide as they fight to survive . <p> In watching the story unfold though , - DeMonaco likes to walk over the same ground he did in- Anarchy- when Leo and the Senator accidentally stumble upon good natured folks just looking to make it through the night. - Mykelti Williamson plays deli owner Joe whose expensive Purge insurance forces him to look after his property the old-fashioned way when the night comes . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Joseph Julian Soria ) who believes that Roans going to change the system and the good people of America will prevail , and there 's a militant resistance leader ( Edwin Hodge ) that 's using the Purge to strike back at the New Founding Fathers . The players are different , but their parts are the same. - <p> The cartoonishness of- The Purge- is a bit striking at times , and I do n't  mean Williamson being the snarky tag along constantly caught off guard by the craziness he finds himself in , though he s excellent in the role . If it was possible for DeMonaco to make the New Founding Fathers anymore cartoonish , I do n't  know how hed do it . The leader ( played by Raymond J. Barry ) seems to enjoy- using the C-word to describe Roan at every opportunity , its like he s a 7-year-old that just discover the word . Our heroes also are chased by mercs who are tattooed and wear the symbol of every white supremacist organization under the sun , you know , in case we needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all- Purge- movies so far , - Election Day- walks right up to the line of being subversive but lacks something that will allow it to cross that line . What 's the point of introducing an idea like " murder tourism " if the tourists are just terrible German stereotypes that were passe after the third- Die Hard ? What 's the point of building an elaborate world if you 're not going to play with more parts of it ? I do n't  know when exactly this movie was developed , but American politics over the last several years should have offered more than enough material to undermine , but Election Days feels like we traded the sharpest possible satire for more freaks off their leash . <p> Having said that though , - The Purge Election Year- is satisfying enough , and probably delivers exactly what it needs to in order to be another successful entry in the series . The door is left ajar for further- Purges- in the end , but the franchise threatens to fall into the trap that so many horror movie franchises have set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , and it surely will , the filmmakers will need to refine the idea again to keep it fresh . For now though , I Purged myself watching- Election Year , and that 's good enough for now . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

But its okay for Pixar movies to be merely fun ; fun and heartwarming without grander aspirations to remind you of your own humanity , or your own mortality. - Thats where- Finding- Dory- lives . The sequel to the 2003 smash hit Finding Nemo- is the perfect sequel in that it expands the world of the original , allows its characters to grow just a little bit more , and recaptures the same sense of fun without too terribly rocking the boat. - <p> That 's a good thing because Pixars enjoyed a hit and miss record so far as sequels go . If the film was called- Toy Story , it was a hit , and if it was n't , it was a miss .

The result is utterly charming and crowd-pleasing . You leave the theater with a smile on your face , and more than a couple of the films gags will stick with you after the credits roll . <p> That does seem like the preoccupation of the film : how best can we recreate the circumstances of- Finding Nemo- to tell a new story . It should be a perfect case for the dreaded " sequel-itis " that 's been plaguing many movies this summer , but sometimes its not what you do , but how you do it. - Finding Dory- does what good sequels do , and builds on the story in a way that allows the plucky comic relief to take centerstage in a believable and relatable way . Dorys gag , her ever present short-term memory loss , is given a tragic twist as she starts getting sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A flashback at the beginning shows how , like Nemo , Dory was fretted upon by her parents ( Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton ) , who worried that she might not be able to make it out in the big ocean alone , until fates separates them . <p> It sounds weird , but watching Dory- unfold is like a kiddie version of- Momento with fish . New events and encounters set off snippets of memory in Dory as she leads Marlin and Nemo to an aquarium and marine rescue institute in California . Marlin is skeptical all the way , of course , and he eventually loses patience with Dory , which is really the only time that anyone gets angry and lashes out at Dory for her particular affliction . Indeed , there 's a subtle undercurrent ( heh ) message in the film of acceptance and understanding . The kids at Nemos school one of numerous fish jokes that are obvious , yet somehow do n't  stink do n't  mock Dory , or call her stupid ; she just forgets for a minute , that 's Dory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been , that 's a very welcome one to grow on . <p> The only other character than Marlin to show any irritability with Dory is Hank the octopus ( Ed ONeill ) . Make that septapus owing to his having lost a tentacle , which is one of the reasons he s perpetually grouchy , so it really is n't anything personal . Hank may be my new favourite Pixar character thanks to ONeills crotchety line readings and the expressive animation that gives Hank so much personality , even though he only ever acts with his eyes . Its Hank and Dorys attempts to navigate across the park , which is sorta sold as a more ethical Sea World , that fills the movie with its best gags and exchanges . Hank helps Dory in exchange for an I 'd tag that will allow Hank to enjoy the comforts of Cleveland aquarium rather than return to the sea , but of course , he gets invested in Dorys journey along the way . <p> Naturally , this being Pixar , the cast is universally excellent . Former The Wire- adversaries- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit pretty , literally at the top of the rock , though they spend much of their time stopping poor Gerald , another sea lion , from sharing their perch. - Its Always- Sunnys Kaitlin Olsen plays Dorys old friend Destiny , a near-sighted whale shark who gives Dory insight and encouragement , while Destinys neighbour , a beluga whale named Bailey , voiced by ONeills- Modern Family- co-star Ty Burrell , is more the cautious type , but his echo location comes in very handy later on in the movie . That , with Sigourney Weaver as herself as the voice of the aquariums guide , provide one of the best- Alien- gags Ive seen in a long while at the cinema . <p> Good gags are fine , but the heart of the film is DeGeneres bittersweet performance as Dory . The movie does n't  dwell too much on the tragic notion of Dorys condition being the cause of her having lost her family , but its left for the audience to fill in those blanks . Throughout the movie there 's a palpable feeling of futility , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fools errand trying to make it through this park and more than a few obstacles to reconnect with her parents . But there 's also a message that in spite of this obstacles , pursuing your dreams whether futile or not , is a good thing . " What Would Dory Do " also becomes a thing , a subtle jab that Marlin , and some of us in the audience , sometimes autopsy our actions in excess before we ever do anything . Do n't  act recklessly , but accept the greater value is in acting rather than staying stuck in a dead end . <p> There 's something old fashioned in this story and those messages , and even though- Finding Dory is impeccably designed and crafted in every modern sense on a technical level , it feels like a throwback to vintage Disney films like- Homeward Bound , which unapologetically reinforces the value and strength of loyalty and family , and how any risk is acceptable if it means keeping those things in your life . In other words , Pixar does it again ! In a summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - Finding Dory- signs , seals and delivers on the hype and will leave both child and parent happy as they head off to the toy store to inevitably pick up the merchandise , or get the Happy Meal toys . <p> Incidentally , I would be remiss if I did n't  mention the short film that proceeded- Finding Dory . It was called Piper and its highly realistic animation feels like the technology is quite nearly ready to push as all the way through the looking glass . You can see every grain of sand , every bubble burst in the incoming tide , and every ruffled feather on the poor baby bird just trying to get a seed on the beach . Plus , Piper is- unstoppably cute , which you ca n't help but notice even as you 're dazzled by the quite nearly seamless realism .

You can admire Shaw for putting up a strong front , but there is a definite crack in the veneer in the end when Shaw realizes that she actually killed a woman and that it was n't part of the Samaritan holodeck . <p> The sly commentary in the episode though gets to the heart of the Machine/Samaritan dichotomy . Max decides to proceed with the reporting of what he knows , a hidden signal sent between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets him killed in the end , a Samaritan agent hidden at the radio station as a receptionist does the deed , and while the team is aghast that Max has been eliminated , the Machine makes the point that Max decided to take the risk .

Granted , it leaves Reese and Finch shocked- because they 've dedicated themselves to saving lives , but if fighting Samaritan means fighting imposed order , then that 's going to mean that there are probably going to have to be acceptable losses when people start to choose their own fate . <p> Speaking of choosing their own fate , Fusco tried to make that case for himself again . Laid up in a hospital bed post-cave-in on Mondays episode , he spent much of " QSO " laid up resting- with Reese and Finch siting vigil outside his room .

The course Elias sets Fusco on leads him to Jeff Blackwell , the ex-con house painter turned Samaritan asset turned conflict Samaritan asset . The surprising thing was that Jeff managed to make it out of the episode alive , the even more surprising thing is that despite the threats from his boss to frame him for a crime he did n't  commit and send him back to jail , and despite the fact that he was asked to kill two innocent people to prevent that from happening , Jeff seemed roused by Samaritans plot to get everyones DNA .

That 's very HYDRA of Samaritan . <p> In so much as these two episodes came down to a debate about trusting in free will , it also set up another equally important debate : how can you fight an enemy that thinks two or three steps ahead ? Is the problem with the way Team Machine is fighting Samaritan that they 're focused too much on the numbers without considering the broader implications . Elias warns Finch by giving a copy of the 1948 novel- Twelve OClock High , which is about a Bombing group led my a man so close to his troops that he s unwilling to risk their lives but still- loses pilots to his poor strategizing .

That things been sitting on his desk for five years ( but who wants to bet Reese fished it out of the trash ) . It seems inevitable that Fusco will come back to the team in any event , but under what conditions , and how close might Finch and Reese be in deciding to share the truth ? <p> For those of you keeping score at home , this was the halfway point for the final season , and there is definitely a feeling that the chess pieces are being arranged for the next phase of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being pushed into making a dramatic decision in regards to fighting Samaritan , and Fuscos on the cusp of finding out something that will change his world .

What supernatural or otherworldly phenomena would spawn if an angel and a demon were to have a forbidden tryst ? What happens when a man of God gains the Almighty 's voice and can direct and command anyone at will ? And when this individual , who has been cursed with this unexpected power over others , learns of God 's vanishing how far will he go to confront his maker and demand some answers ? <p> This is Preacher . <p> AMC network has added to their lineup Preacher , the latest in comic book titles adapted for a television series . Brought on board as executive producers to assist producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg ( both of Superbad , Pineapple Express , This Is the End ) and showrunner Sam Catlin ( Breaking Bad ) , are the comic book 's creator Garth Ennis and Preacher 's artist Steve Dillon . Many fans of the Vertigo Comics title are wondering if the show will deviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer that , let 's take a look back at Ennis and Dillon 's creation and get you up to speed on all things Preacher . <p> What would happen if an angel and a demon were to mate and the spirit of their offspring embodied a mortal man ? <p> Created in 1995 for Vertigo Comics , a DC Comics imprint , Preacher was the brainchild of Eisner Award-winning writer Garth Ennis . Known for such popular series as Hellblazer , Hitman , and The Punisher , the story and concept of Preacher came to Ennis while working on the Hellblazer series for Vertigo . <p> The writer , known for his dark tones with accents of satirical humor tossed in , joined forces with acclaimed artist Steve Dillon , who had previously worked with Ennis on Judge Dredd , The Punisher , and Hellblazer . The duo knew they had something special and unique on their hands . The series slowly gained followers after word-of- mouth of this intense , graphic , and at times mesmerizing comic book . An adaptation for Preacher has been in the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ennis , feeling Preacher possessed all the qualities of a successful feature film , began writing drafts in 1998 to pitch to studios . One setback after another delayed the project from moving forward in any capacity . <p> Finally we will get to witness a live-adaptation version of the series known for its unusual and quirky characters , enjoyable satire , captivating story arcs , and often violent situations that arise . <p> Preacher centers on Jesse Custer , a small town preacher from Annville , Texas who becomes possessed by a mysterious entity , born out of a taboo affair between an angel and a demon . The curse ( or perhaps blessing ? ) endows Jesse with the Voice of God ; with it , the words he projects have the capability to force his will upon those who hear him speak . Upon being consumed with this new power , Jesse 's church is wiped out and all the members of his congregation are killed . Custer , upon learning that God has departed from Heaven and is living on Earth , sets out to confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and questions the very God he preaches . His challenging God Almighty has become his mission . It has given him purpose . <p> Jesse recruits the help of Tulip O'Hare , a brash and feisty ex-girlfriend of Jesse 's who 's not afraid to use a gun . The wannabe assassin , though she botched her first contract , comes across as a tough as nails female , but she carries pain with her : the loss of her parents , Jesse suddenly departing from her life , and a battle with addiction . <p> The love/hate dynamic between former lovers Jesse and Tulip play sporadically through the series . Tulip still upset about Jesse up and ditching her five years earlier . <p> Jesse and Tulip may not have reunited had it not been for a wise-cracking Irish vampire named Cassidy . The wanderer had given Tulip a lift and the three come together and ally themselves with one another . Another who struggles with drugs and alcohol , Cassidy offers a great deal of comic relief throughout the series .

The journey takes them all across the United States , from the deep South , to New York , and the swamps of Louisiana , to name a few . <p> The trio encounter a slew of memorable , and often bizarre , characters that accentuate the story and make for some enthralling reading . From some inbred hillbillies in the South , an ancient religious conspiratorial group , the Klan , serial killers , fallen angels , a Cowboy who can kill anything and is on the hunt for Jesse named The Saint of Killers , psycho goths , an assassin , and a suicidal teenager named Arseface ( because his face looks like an arse you 'll see ) . Oh yeah , let 's not forget about the spirit of John Wayne making frequent cameos . The adventures that Jesse , Tulip , and Cassidy encounter is some of the best writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backstories , which hopefully see light in the TV series . Strong , compelling , emotional , brutal , intense , and memorable , Ennis outdoes himself and delivers a unique and intoxicating series . <p> A resolute atheist himself , Ennis does mention and incorporate quite a few biblical references . Though he depicts a world where the Almighty is NOT an all- loving God , the series did draw parallels to facets of The Bible : Jesus , The Grail , fallen angels , and an ancient religious order sworn to protect Christ 's bloodline . <p> Also what some may consider sacrilegious is when it is revealed to Cassidy that Jesus Christ actually had children and did not die on the cross . After living a life into his middle-age years , his bloodline worked its way through generations of incestuous marriages in order for it to retain its divine nature . The stories can be pornographic , sadistic , masochistic , vulgar , and contain a lot of black humor . As you can see , Preacher held nothing back and no topic was off-limits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is for Ennis to get credit for Preacher 's success , Steve Dillon 's illustrations brought the characters to life .

Ennis and Dillon 's passion truly come to light as each put out their best material and combined to deliver unique and compelling story arcs , produce controversial images depicting the horrors of the world , and a cast of characters that are wildly engaging and appealing . <p> There 's a reason why the series was a hit for DC Comics/Vertigo it was the fantastic storytelling and the creative mind of Garth Ennis accompanied with the powerfully vivid imagery by Steve Dillon . Preacher is widely regarded as one of the greatest comic book titles of all time . The title has made an impact in numerous ways .

Certainly Ennis will want the show to , at the very least , maintain its foundation : the characters , the environment , the mood and tone of the story , and especially the premise . Veering too far off from his writing would be a discredit to Ennis ' hard work on the comic book and almost a slap in the face to true fans of the series who have waited anxiously to see this phenomenal story brought to life . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Snyder is a more than capable director . His shots are gorgeous ; his movies look great , but he may not be the best storyteller . When he s dealing with the kind of bloody spectacle that does n't  require much character development like- 300 or- Dawn of the Dead , its fine . But an ongoing critique of Snyders work is that his characters and subject matter lack depth and , for better or worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have depth . People want to identify with them . They represent the best in the audience . Their larger-than-life powers and stature means that their humanity has to be magnified to balance them out . His handling of Superman is especially egregious as the characters defining traits are his humility and his innate devotion to helping people and Snyder just kind of does away with all that . Supermans motivations are unclear ; the characters driving personality traits have been stripped away . Seriously , Batman and Superman not only kill people , but they 're largely indifferent to the deaths of innocent people . <p> Now look at Marvel . Every character has clear , defining personality traits propelling them across multiple movies . With the exception of- the- Hulk , who would be devastated by killing someone , the- Avengers are hardened soldiers ( despite what Tony might say ) and have come to terms with taking the life of an opponent in a violent standoff . That 's true to their characters. - Captain America will always stand up against what he thinks is wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him. - Bruce Banner/the Hulk has always felt uncomfortable being around other people . He does n't  trust himself and everything he does is tinged with that fear that he s going to lose control and hurt somebody. - Thor has mostly overcome his arrogance to become a true leader and will do anything it takes to protect Asgard and Earth , which he has come to think of as a second home. - Black Widow is always compensating for her past , at times trying to pay penance for it and at other times running from it . Tony Starks driving motivation is his legacy . His concern for his legacy , which is fueled in part by his regard for his father and the legacy he left behind , is what drives him to get out of weapons manufacturing and become a superhero in the first place . You can follow that motivation through the Stark Expo in- Iron Man 2- through to the decisions he makes , both good and bad , in- Avengers : Age of Ultron . <p> A lack of heart can manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for excessive exposition , as evidenced by Snyders movies . When character motivations are clear , a lot can be understood through simple actions ; you do n't  have to have dialogue explicitly explaining what 's going on . This can create fun little moments and the witty dialogue that defines Marvel movies , especially in the work done by- Joss Whedon , - John Favreau , and- James Gunn . Coulson talking about his trading cards and Ultron singing " I 've Got No Strings " and- Rocket Raccoon- trying to get people steal other peoples prosthetic body parts all come from a deep respect of characterization . Simple lines like " I can do this all day , " " We are Groot , " - and " You did n't  see that coming ? " have so much weight and power because of the structure that has been built around them . <p> One thing that has allowed Marvel to imbue all of its characters with that heart is that it has taken its time . DC may be suffering from the fact that its only on its second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Marvel had five movies under their belt before they delivered any kind of major crossover .

That strained yet unconditional love is palpable and makes that scene compelling . <p> While Marvel does a great job of developing its heroes , a common complaint is that their villains are two-dimensional and expendable . For every fully fleshed out Loki , you have a questionably motivated Malekith or- Abomination . It may be unfortunate , but sometimes your villain needs to be something of a plot device . Its great when the development of your hero is intertwined with the development of your villain . That 's how you get things like the relationship between Thor and Loki or the brilliant interplay between Batman and the- Joker in- The Dark Knight . But sometimes your villain is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protagonist. - Ronan was just a way to push the- Guardians of the Galaxy together so that they could learn the power of friendship. - Obadiah Stane- was just a way to make Tony Stark examine his life and turn over a new leaf. - Yellow Jacket was just a way for Ant-Man to redeem himself in the eyes of society and his family. - Obviously , the more developed your villain is , the better your movie will be , but you have to make sure not to overwhelm the development of your protagonists . Its their story . Focusing on the villains is what derailed the original- Batman- film franchise . Do you want- Arnold Schwarzenegger- as- Mr. Freeze ? Because this is how you get- Arnold Schwarzenegger as- Mr. Freeze ! <p> Another major complaint against the MCU is its lack of diversity . Sure , most titular heroes get their very own black sidekick , but that 's really not how you do equal representation. - Thats not to say that Marvel does n't  do a mostly good job with the POC and female characters that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roles are rich , but they 're just not as plentiful or quite as meaty as the roles for white men . This is not to downplay the amount of ass being kicked on television by- Jessica Jones or- Agent Carter . Sweet Christmas ! Those shows are good ! But with the exception of- Scarlett Johansson , who is second only to- Robert Downey Jr . as far as featured MCU appearances ( and that 's without having her own movie ) , women are not nearly as represented on the big screen ( no disrespect to- Shane Black , who had a super powered- Gwyneth Paltrow- destroy- Guy Pearce- and save Tony Stark in the final act of- Iron Man 3 ) . Its still going to be movies #18 and #21 before fans get a movie led by a black character and a female character , respectively ( #20 if you count- Ant-Man and the Wasp ) . <p> Despite some missteps here and there , Marvel continues to deliver characters that fans know and love in a way that somehow manages to meet and then exceed expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second to none . Their devotion to , not only the source material , but the audience experience for fans both new and old is something that every other studio should aspire to . Its great to see other studios learning from what Marvel is doing well ( Sonys deal with Spider-Man , Foxs treatment of Deadpool and bringing Singer back in on X-Men ) and hopefully they can figure it out for the properties that are n't  doing so well . Lookin at you , Warner Bros. /DC and Fox , just give up the rights to the- Fantastic Four and let Marvel do it . Or make a deal like Sony did with Spider-Man . Either way , Marvel shows no sign of slowing. - Captain America : Civil War is right around the corner , followed soon after by- Doctor Strange- and- Luke Cage . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Yes , it has been that long since the Japanese manga turned anime series about a group of female warriors , their talking cats and their friend in the penguin suit came to North American shores , and from the look of the crowd , most of the room remembered watching it first run at lunch hour on YTV . So when Ballantyne said that many in the room had questions brewing for over two decades , they did . <p> Five members of the original voice cast Linda Ballantyne ( Sailor Moon ) , Toby Proctor ( Tuxedo Mask ) , Susan Roman ( Sailor Jupiter ) , Ron Rubin ( Artemis ) and Jill Frappier ( Luna ) took part in the Sailor Moon panel , and two decades seems to have not dulled their chemistry , nor those familiar voices .

" I got around , " she joked . <p> While they can joke about it now , when these five actor assembled to give voice to their characters 20 years ago , it required some adjustment . " Its quite different , from typical voice acting , " said Roman . " Normally you lay down the voice track first and the animators draw from that , but we did this 20 something years ago , late at night and we had no idea what we were doing or what this would escalate to . " <p> " Doing anime is a lot like karaoke that way , you get the words and follow the bouncing ball , " added Balantyne , who explained that cast were rarely given full scripts , and they always performed their lines while watching the clip in question . " That could be problematic for me at points . We were doing what we saw right in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it . " <p> Another unusual thing that the actors saw was more roles for women , than roles for men . " This show was so groundbreaking , so unbelievably amazing for us as actors and they the Sailor Scouts were all so different too and we just did n't get that as women , " said Ballentyne . <p> " If I can give you aspiring writers a piece of advice , its write for women in their prime , " added Frappier , who was cast as Luna after she was told she was too old to voice a teacher . " Its amazing how little roles there are for women my age , " she said explaining that getting to play Luna was like a combination of Queen Victoria , Yoda and C-3PO . <p> Rubin said that for the male actors , the shoe was on the other foot in terms of auditioning . " There were only two male leads and I never read for Tux , " he said , " but they had me read for Artemis . They wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less hyper , more chill . " <p> Of course , Sailor Moon was hardly about the guys , and the actors think the message of female empowerment and how young women with different personalities can work together , is one of the reasons the show still resonates . <p> " I like the ones about having your friends back , " said Roman . " Sometimes , in that time period the 90s , girls would sacrifice their friendships if it meant they got the guy . The message here always was you have your friends back , and I think that 's really positive and I hope everyone that grew up with that message and took it heart . " <p> " So often the girls are just pullees , they get pulled into action , " explained Frappier . " Here the girls were leaders . They were n't perfect , but they could be heroes , not super women . Real heroes are people who are afraid and they can still do something . It makes you feel an empathy with them and you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pullee .

Sailor Moon had so much strength , the whole show , and I hope girls see that there 's so much strength in the various personalities and there 's something for everyone to agree with .

The biggest among those crammed items is a rather blatant and explicit five minute long sequence that introduced members of the Justice League that did n't  have a significant role in the story , including Victor Stone , AKA : Cyborg , played by Ray Fisher . In that vignette though , there 's a much more significant reveal that Snyder has now confirmed . Beware ! There be spoilers revealed from here <p> So if you 're still reading , it will be assumed that you 've seen Batman V. Superman , or that you do n't  care . As you 'll recall , the video accessed by Wonder Woman ( Gal Gadot ) shows the origin of Stone becoming Cyborg thanks to his scientist father played by Joe Morton , and a mysterious technologically advanced box , which Snyder has now confirmed is a Mother Box . <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an agonizing birth .

" <p> Liefeld said that competition amongst Marvels marquee artists at the time was fierce so he was trying to make his mark against colleagues like Todd McFarlane , and Jim Lee .

The good thing that came out of Origins is that they knew they blew it .

" All that was on the page since 2010 , the first two acts are unchanged from Deadpool , " Liefeld explained . " here 's the miracle of Deadpool : they did n't hire other writers .

@@36130173 @5130173/ <p> As I was watching Gods of Egypt , I was reminded of an episode of Disneys often-criticized version of Doug . The episode involved a big-shot character named Guy- being inspired by a Broadway show to make a musical based on the Mona Lisa . He asks a goofy character named Skeeter to write it . <p> Skeeter asks : - " What 's the story ? " <p> To which Guy responds : - " Who cares ? Its the most famous painting ever ! Its got ta be ( great ) , right ? " <p> Skeeter has trouble thinking of a story , so Doug hands him a book of fairy tales . Skeeter ends up writing a cliched story that pretty much rips off Cinderella , and Guy loves it . <p> And then it hit me : in 1997 , Disneys Doug predicted- the inception of Gods of Egypt almost two decades later . Alex Proyas probably skimmed a book on- Egyptian mythology and ordered a big-budget blockbuster based on his perception of it . He then proceeded to hire two hapless writers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its characters . Say what you want about Disneys Doug , but it made a solid prediction if you ask me . <p> NOTE : This review contains SPOILERS . <p> Gods of Egypt is the story of an Egyptian god named Horus ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ) who is heir to Egypts throne . However , - bitter god named Set ( Gerard Butler ) robs him of his powers and takes the throne in a- coup detat . Set enslaves the non-wealthy people of Egypt and it is up to a plucky mortal thief named Bek ( Brenton Thwaites ) to help return Horus to the throne . <p> The plot sounds simple , but the story unfortunately veers into a sandstorm of subplots just short of Jupiter Ascending levels . One subplot involves Horus and Set trying to earn the respect of their father Ra ( Geoffrey Rush ) , who is god of the sun . Another subplot involves the goddess of love Hathor ( Elodie Yung ) trying to escape from Sets kingdom and reunite with her lover , Horus . Yet another subplot involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the throne in exchange from getting his girlfriend Zaya ( Courtney Eaton ) back from the afterlife . Just like with Jupiter , none of these subplots work in a film too preoccupied with trying to be eye candy . <p> The subplot involving Bek and Zaya especially fails because the two have zero romantic chemistry and barely share any screen time together to make the audience care about them . Besides recite a few one-liners , the only thing Bek does for Zaya is steal a dress for her and recite cliched dialogue about how they 're going to run off together one day . Other than that , they are given absolutely no development besides some bland exposition at the beginning . I often hear people criticize Aladdin and Jasmine for being bland characters in Disneys Aladdin , but they are far more developed than these two . <p> How are we introduced to Aladdin ? He shows off his charisma in a big musical number by stealing some bread and later gives some of it to a poor child . Its a memorable first impression that sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bek ? He quickly steals a dress and spouts off exposition with Zaya. - Moreover , while Jasmine was shown to be an ambitious princess who tired of her life in the palace , Zaya was just there as a plot device . <p> Speaking of Disney , one cant help but notice how shamelessly Gods of Egypt steals common plot elements from other Disney films . <p> A plucky street rat who goes on an adventure ? Stolen from Aladdin . <p> The main character having to save his girlfriend from the afterlife ? Stolen from Hercules . <p> A bitter brother taking over the throne and turning the kingdom into a dictatorship ? Stolen from The Lion King . <p> While Disney does n't  exactly own these plot elements , the fact that they worked so well in those animated films just goes to show how utterly uninspired Gods of Egypt is . <p> The script is n't the only problem with this film though ; the editing is just as bad . While the editing is n't as awful as something like Taken 3 , it still cuts way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the editing has absolutely no rhythm with the film itself , and cuts are often sporadic or too early . One fight scene ends with a giant snake bursting into flames . In what seems like two seconds , the film transitions- from the characters running from the explosion to the characters slowly walking outside of a cave reciting witty banter . Seriously , it is that jarring . <p> Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the overload of lavish but cheap special effects . I have never in my life seen a film so appropriately fit the textbook definition of " style over substance " than this one . Even though the costumes and props appear appropriately lavish , they still look artificial on screen . I would n't be surprised if the production team went to JC Penny and bought whatever costume jewelry they could find . This film has a $140 million budget , but most of the money clearly went to the CG effects instead of the costumes . <p> The CG effects are just as lavish and unconvincing . Whether its incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has- some kind of special effect in it . The gods shed gold blood , they have glowing jewels for brains , and they ride chariots pulled by giant flying scarab beetles. - Even the scenes with the humans interacting with the gods ( in human form ) need bad digital effects . <p> Because the gods are much taller than the humans , characters like Horus are constantly turning into unconvincing CG models when sharing the screen with a mortal- character . The film often tries to hide the obvious effects with dark lighting , but if you have a good eye , you can certainly tell the difference between a real- Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and a fake one . Though to be fair , his performance was so robotic that it was sometimes hard to tell . <p> Besides- Coster-Waldaus dull acting , the rest of the performances are nothing special . Gerard Butler is occasionally fun to watch but is mostly just a boring villain- and- Brenton Thwaits is just average .

Boseman has proven himself as an actor , so it seemed like he was acting this way on purpose to vent his confusion at such a pointless production . If there 's anything worth seeing in this film , its seeing Boseman punk the entire production . <p> Besides Boseman , the only other positive thing I could say about this film is that the aformentioned scene with the giant snakes was pretty slick and entertaining to watch .

After many long decades of waiting , we the audience get to see the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel duke it out on the big screen . That 's not all though ; were gon na be getting our first look at Wonder Woman in all her bad ass glory . In an age of superhero movies being released up the- wazoo , dedicated fans have been waiting on baited breath to see DCs attempt at building its own cinematic universe . So how exactly did it turn out ? Wellit did some things rightand some things VERY wrong . <p> *** MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW . Consider yourself warned *** <p> The Good : <p> Wonder Woman <p> Although her screen time is short , Gal Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman , and the character is quite likable as well . Gadot brings enthusiasm and charm to the role that perfectly fits- Wonder Womans character . Wonder Woman herself is a confident , sly and fiesty character that brings a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There are reports of crowds cheering for the scene where she bursts into action , and the cheers are certainly deserved . Her role in the story may be minuscule , but Wonder Woman is a welcome character in this crowded film . <p> Batman <p> When Ben Affleck was first announced as Batman , the internet went insane . Some were hopeful while others were filled with rage . Many doubted that an actor like Affleck could give a performance that honors the caped crusaders legacy . Fortunately , out of all of the problems that Batman V Superman ended up having , Ben Affleck was not one of them. - He s able to be the intimidating , dark and tough-as-nails hero that we all know and love . Even with weak dialogue , Affleck is able to make the most of his role , - doing his best to give a deep , layered performance that really stands out . It certainly is a longshot from the trainwreck that a lot of people thought it would be . <p> Alfred <p> Like Wonder Woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast , giving Alfred a gruff , intellectual and dryly humorous- persona that plays nicely off of Batman . Even when he s behind a computer guiding Batman through a mission , he is still quite likable , sipping whiskey and even cracking a few one-liners to lighten the mood . In some ways , Irons Alfred- even tops Michael Caines . Alfred is truly memorable here , and one of the few highlights of the project . <p> The Bad : <p> Superman <p> One of the biggest complaints of Man of Steel was that Superman was an angry and unlikable character . However , this film brings his unlikability to a whole nother level . For a character that symbolizes truth , justice and the American way , he seemed much more like that jerk in high school that was always angry at you for no reason . Even worse is the way he reacts to innocent people ( besides Lois Lane ) being in danger . At the beginning of the film , Lois informs him that congress- found him responsible for wrecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process ) - just to save her . Supermans reaction is basically rolling his eyes in annoyance and saying " I do n't  care . " Its like he feels that he cant save people without destroying anything , and that people should just deal with it . Whatever happened to him caring about the people of Earth ? He seemed to have no sympathy in this movie and was more interested in making out with Lois- Lane . Hopefully hell have some kind of divine revelation in future DC films and actually become likable . <p> Lex Luthor <p> While Jesse Eisenbergs performance as Lex Luthor was occasionally fun t0 watch ( sometimes unintentionally ) , it still felt like a terrible portrayal of Supermans archenemy . Eisenberg feels as miscast in this movie as John Wayne was as Genghis Kahn. - Luthor never feels very- threatening and just comes across as a strange , spoiled little precocious child . Whether he s feeding someone- Jolly Ranchers or threatening someone with a jar of urine , he feels more like a crappy version of the Joker than Lex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretentious monologues , that you could actually make a drinking game out of it : one shot for every time he says " angels " " gods " or " demons . " Eisenberg is a fine actor , but he just was n't right to play such an iconic villain like Lex Luthor . <p> The Hilariously-Humorless Tone . <p> If you thought Man of Steel was dour and humorless , prepare to be blown away . Batman V Superman is so joyless that it starts and ends with a funeral ( no kidding ) . This film tries so hard to be dark and gritty that it is actually hilarious at some points . For example , early on in the film there is a flashback to when Bruce Wayne witnesses the collateral damage of Supermans battle with General Zod . One of his office buildings is destroyed in the battle and an employee of his has his legs crushed by the wreckage . This scene works in the context of the story , but somebody behind the camera figured that it was n't dark enough . For some odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreckage of Wayne Enterprises , pointing out that her parents were in it . This is such an obvious attempt to make the film grittier that it is unintentionally hilarious . Other scenes of the movie involve a human trafficking dungeon , a tearful courtroom testimony , and Martha Kent being bound , gagged and threatened to be burned alive . Ironically , lightening up the super-serious tone would have helped us take the film more seriously . Throwing in a couple of random one liners simply just does n't  cut it when the whole film feels like a slog . <p> The CGI <p> Remember the car chase in The Dark Knight that was filmed with real vehicles and explosives ? Remember how exciting that was to watch ? Apparently Zack Snyder did n't  . Batman V Superman is so packed to the brim with unconvincing CGI that it is incredibly hard to get invested in the setpieces . In the Marvel movies , the colorful CGI works because the relatively light tone and vibrant colors suits the bombastic CG effects . In a serious film like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production look unconvincing . Potentially exciting scenes like a car chase with the Batmobile and Superman saving an exploding rocket are ruined by the unconvincing effects , and even the final battle is dominated with dull , washed-out CGI . The only good thing about the- obvious computer effects- is that they provide some good unintended laughs during the overly-serious scenes . <p> Doomsday <p> Why was Doomsday even in this film ? Was there not enough CG in it ? His appearacne does n't  even make sense within the context of the story . Up until Doomsday arrived , the story felt like a political drama . Once he shows up , it turns into a generic superhero movie with an unstoppable bad guy . It was like they tacked him onto the script at the last minute. - Basically , Lex Luthor gets- into Zods crash landed ship and somehow figures out how to use the technology to turn Zods corpse into Doomsday . Barely any explanation is given as to why Luthor would think to do this or why he knew how , but who cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance alone is bound to sell tickets and drum up hype ; who said anything about it making sense ? <p> The Script <p> This is arguably the most boring and incoherent superhero movie since Fant4stic . The first half of this film feels like a political drama with endless unsubtle discussions on Supermans capabilities and the second half feels like forced Justice League build-up . Instead of- an exciting movie where Batman and Superman engage in a thrilling conflict , this film settles for an incoherent story involving dream sequences and espionage . <p> Instead of diving into an interesting story where Superman faces his destructive potential head-on , this movie spends a lot of its time on scenes and characters that frankly should have been cut . One hysterical dream sequence involves Bruce Wayne being attacked at his parents mausoleum by a giant CGI bat . Another scene involves Wayne dreaming up a dystopia where Superman has destroyed the world and everyone who does n't  worship him ( also with giant CGI bats ) . Just for good measure , the filmmakers managed to throw in a ridiculous-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be a countless amount of scenes where characters make long-winded speeches . Lex Luthor makes several of them , and it feels like the script couldnt go two minutes without a character droning on about various plot elements . Imagine if you took the witty dialogue of The Avengers and replaced it with tedious exposition . Youd get a disjointed mess of a movie , which is what Batman V Superman- unfortunately ended up being . <p> The Ending <p> So how are we going to end this grand , spectacular clash between- two comic book icons ? How about having Doomsday supposedly kill Superman and focus- the last few minutes of the- film on- his funeral ? There 's even a scene where Martha Kent reveals that he was going to propose to Lois Lane for some cheap drama. - It just drags on and on , only to imply to the audience that Superman is alive by having the dirt on his coffin levitate . Yep , they actually decided to end this supposedly deep and gritty film with a bloody Disney Death trope . <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your- " grown-up " version of Superman seriously when you end this movie with a trope- that Disney has been doing since the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ? At least when films like Pacific Rim run with this trope , they do n't  spend the rest of the movie trying to be super-serious , so it works much better . In this case though , it just adds yet another flaw to this film , making almost the entire production look like a complete embarrassment . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

In addition to having the highest opening day- for an R-rated movie , Deadpool is additionally set to have one of the biggest opening weekends for a superhero movie in general . Tom Rothman must be having one hell of a temper tantrum . More importantly , it got an A on Cinemascore , insuring that it wont be as front-loaded as some people expected . Its pretty clear that audiences ate up every scene like a freshly-made chimichanga , and why shouldnt they ? There are so many memorable moments to chose from in the Merc with a Mouths big movie that its hard to keep track of all of them . So here are some of our favorite scenes . <p> CAUTION : CONTAINS SPOILERS <p> 1 . The Opening Credits . <p> Deadpools opening credits are quite something . In a bullet time extravaganza , Deadpool shoots one man , teabags another , and gives another a wedgie . Leave it to Deadpool to master the difficult art of multi-tasking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even catch a glimpse of a cheesy-looking trading card that looks an awful lot like Green Lantern . Making fun of a movie that nearly wrecked your career takes guts , so kudos to you , Mr. Reynolds . <p> Also , while an ordinary opening credits sequence would simply show the names of the people who worked on the film , Deadpools opening credits take an incredibly clever approach to it . Instead of the actors names , it lists trope characters for the superhero genre . These include " the hot chick , " " the comic relief , " " a CGI character , " " a moody teen " and " a gratuitous cameo. " - Let 's face it : weve all seen these characters in superhero films , and they even exist in Deadpool . To see a movie mock itself Honest-Trailers-style is pretty damn awesome if you ask us . If this sequence sounds great on paper , its even better on film . <p> 2 . Let 's Count em Down . <p> Early on in the movies freeway scene , Deadpool runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six bullets each . In an attempt to conserve the limited ammo he has left , Deadpool is forced to count how many bullets he fires into the bad guys . He tells the audience to count down with him , and starts shooting . Each bullet is numbered , so as Deadpool fires them off , the numbers on the primers go from 12 to 1 . <p> After a few hits and misses , Deadpool is left with one bullet and three more guys to take out . In an appropriately R-rated fashion , he fires the bullet through all of their heads in a straightforward path , turning their craniums into gory messes . Talk about killing three birds with one pistol . <p> 3 . Holiday Sex . <p> Youve heard of Jeremihs birthday sex , but what about the other holidays ? Before becoming Deadpool , Wade Wilson falls in love with a- fiery prostitute- named Vanessa . After a game of skee ball , the obligatory sex scene followsbut it is n't just a sex sceneits a sex montage . Ryan Reynolds first teased this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Theres a rather large , grandiose sex montage in the movie , but its not as titillating as it is just funny and horrifying at times . " <p> So what does this montage entail ? In a rather creative way to show the passage of time , Wade and Vanessa are seen doing it on several holidays throughout the year . This includes oral sex with plastic vampire teeth on Halloween , foodplay on Thanksgiving , and even a scene where Wade is pegged ( feel free to Google it ) by Vanessa on International Womens Day . They certainly are a festive couple . <p> 4 . Colossus gets Sucker-PunchedDown There . <p> Along with Rhonda Rousey , Gina Carano is perhaps the last woman in Hollywood you want to mess with . After all , she is a former mixed martial artist . In this movie , she plays Angel Dust , a mutant with enough super strength to rival Colossus . In fact , in the films climax , she ends up duking it out with the big metal giant and puts up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic battle , the villanous Angel Dust decides to fight dirty . <p> As if her character was n't evil enough , she actually sucker-punches Colossus right in his metal junk without even flinching ( unlike Deadpool , who broke his hands and leg trying this earlier ) . This sends Colossus crippling to the ground . As if the thought of Gina Carano punching you in the groin is n't bad enough , the thought of her punching you in the groin as Angel Dust is sure to give a lot of guys nightmares . <p> 5 . A Different Kind of Regeneration . <p> Anybody who reads the Deadpool comic series will know that one of his most defining powers is the ability to regenerate damaged skin cells . Much like Wolverine , any injury from a papercut to a bullet hole can heal within seconds . Deadpool can even heal severed limbs in a ratherunique way . <p> After the films freeway sequence , Deadpool cuts his hand off to escape being handcuffed by Colossus . Later that day , he is back at his house sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AL . In a rather surprising moment , we get to see how Deadpools regeneration powers regrow an entire body part . Deadpool puts his left hand on her face , and there is shown to be a babys hand growing from the stump where his hand was cut off . It turns out that if a limb is cut off , it has to grow back from the beginning of conception . Its such a bizzare visual that you ca n't help but laugh at it . Deadpool even makes a comment on how big " it " will feel in his hand . <p> 6 . What 's My Name ? <p> Ajax and Deadpool have quite a history in the comic series . Ajax- loves subjecting Deadpool to unfathomable torture while Deadpool loves messing with the fact that Ajaxs real name is Francis . Their relationship is perfectly translated on screen as Ajax asks Deadpool what his name is throughout the film . He wants to be called Ajax , but the merc keeps calling him Francis , refusing to bow down to his enemys demands . This running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . <p> Just before his final battle with Ajax , Deadpool successfully takes out a swarm of his henchmen armed with nothing but two- katanas . After asking what his name is constantly throughout the story , Ajax finds Deadpools final answer literally laid out in front of him . The dead henchmen are revealed to be precisely arranged on the ground by Deadpool so that their corpses spell out " FRANCIS . " That 's a hell of a way to own your arch enemy if you ask us . <p> 7 . Stan Lees Best Cameo Yet ? <p> With a few rare exceptions , any movie based on a Marvel property is bound to have Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee cameo in it . At 93 years old , Stan Lee has cameoed in almost every Marvel movie . He even made an appearance in Big Hero 6 describing how to conserve underwear ( funnily enough , to T.J. Millers character in that film ) . One keeps wondering how the comic book legend can - outdo himself with his next cameo . The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee plays the hysterical part of- an MC- at a strip club that Wade visits . After judging a beauty pageant in Iron Man 3 and traveling across space in Guardians of the Galaxy , this guy sure does get around . What makes this even funnier is that Stan Lee created Stripperella , an animated show about a stripper who lives a double life as a superhero . Perhaps its the same strip club that Stripperella works at , but who knows ? All we know is that Deadpool is an epic- experience that should be seen at all costs . <p> If you loved these moments as much as we did , take your friends to see it right away . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Granted , and to the best of my knowledge , Jason Momoa does n't  ( publicly ) play the ukulele and booking David Hasselhoff for gigs outside of Germany is neither cheap nor advised well there is a wide expanse of nerd music out there to draw from . <p> To bring what was on stage at the Saskatoon Expo full circle , yes being that close to William Shatner and knowing that you are sharing air with the only man to ever actually beat the the Kobayashi Maru was an added little thrill . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not without its heartfelt and true moments . When asked about his relationship with his late Star Trek co-star , Leonard Nimoy , Shatner said the two of them shared many things like a bit of a quirky sense of humor , adding " I 'd fall on my knees with the way hed make me laugh , " as well as saying that he is currently working on a book about his 50 year plus- friendship with Nimoy , due out sometime next year . As far as the displaying that Shatner sense of humor when a asked whod win between Kirk and Han Solo , Shatner quipped " who ? Harrison Ford ? But he s an old man ! " <p> If the above counts as the galactic central point , then beyond it lays the great expanse the- events final frontier ( ok , that is the last of the Star Trek puns , honest . ) The floor . Between the masses of cosplay and the many vendors and more rests the real experience . To truly emerge yourself in the culture and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , to be among my people . Ok , maybe that is a little dramatic , but the real fun and life blood of any nerd con convergence type thing is the main floor and with the Saskatoon Expo growing a full 60%+ over last year- as well as inhabiting a new and bigger space , some growing pains could be observed . - Congestion was a little high at times and when a panel would let out , the mass exodus back to main hall would create more than a few choke points through the connecting passages . If it feels like I am reaching to trying and find something to be critical , I kind of am . Yes there was a crowd , but still and well mannered and managed one . One that , if anything , is more a positive than a negative since it points to the growth the event has experienced . As the Saskatoon Expo continues to grow ( along with sister events in Calgary and Edmonton , ) I 'd expect to see and hear more about these Expos from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever growing convention scene . <p> Now on with the cosplay . When you pack 13,000 or more of the faithful in to an event center , many of them take advantage of it and take to the wild ( and sometimes weird ) world of cosplay . What follows is a small gallery of the sites of the Saskatoon Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo . One that is in no way all encompassing- ( and if you want to share your own feel free to do so in the comments below ) of what was on hand , but just small taste of the costumes and creativity and- the Harley Quinns .

@@36130249 @5130249/ <p> Guardians of the Galaxy is a perfect comic book movie ! It truly is one of the most unique and delightful films Marvel has created to date . It features memorable and enjoyable characters , is filled with all the required thrills and spills , and its an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun . Its like eating a big mac and a large fry at 2am after a night of drunken debauchery , its that good . <p> Peter Quill , or Star Lord as he likes to call himself , is a quick-witted man of Earth thrown into the far reaches of galaxy , who has stolen an artifact that everyone seems to want . By accident he stumbles upon four other characters , Gamora the assassin , Drax the Destroyer , Rocket the enhanced raccoon and Groot the humanoid tree , and the five of them form an unlikely team . <p> Not one performance , however , can live up to the two characters that completely steal the entire show , Rocket and Groot voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most entertaining and likable characters . They are also two of the funniest characters in the entire picture behaving like the classic straight and funny man routine of Abbott and Costello fame but twice as fun . <p> Well talk about these two figures independently in a moment , but we have to start by acknowledging the packaging . Its quite a large box ( standing at over 15 inches and almost twice the width of a normal Sideshow/Hot Toys box ) with a striking- print out of both characters in an cool action pose laid over a star studded , cloudy , blue and black galaxy . And , no , the giant " G " does not stand for Groot ( though it very well should , #TeamGroot ) , its the first letter in the films logo. - The duo comes in a gigantic window box that has a slip cover over top of it. - Theres nothing too graphically special about the box art , yet the sheer size and simpleness of the art well - have you channeling your inner Joey Lawrence " Whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sideshow / Hot Toy figures , its contents are packaged with the collector in mind . Where most toys and collectibles require you to act out deep rooted Freddy Krueger fantasies to cut your figure(s) loose , Sideshow / Hot Toys have no twist ties , tape , or any other kind of furious obstacles between you and your goods . The figures and their accessories are laid out neatly in a tray so that you can store them back up for transporting or to resell if you wanted to , keeping the value intact . <p> Groot is an absolutely amazing character . He has so much personalty even though he ca n't really converse . If you love him and the movie , then you 'll be more than satisfied with Hoy Toys spot-on recreation of the character . <p> At first glance , the figures immense stature is certainly an eye catching presence . At over 14 inches tall , he is an absolutely massive piece of wood. - Those eyes though . the- depth and life in the eyes are what truly captures the characters harmless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Uh maybe not . <p> His face is actually a removable faceplate that can be swapped out for the alternative screaming head sculpt ( that look when you stub your pinky toe ) that comes with the collectors set . While I will always prefer the lighter face , the alternative head- emotes a much more aggressive expression with just as much sense of character as the softer , warmer face . Personally , I would have- liked another kinder face Groot , his smiles were so adorable . <p> Other accessories include : 5 pieces of interchangeable palms ; including ( 1 ) pair of relaxed palms , ( 1 ) open left palm with real-like glow effect and ( 1 ) pair of partially clenched palms - ( exclusive for the collectible set ) . Also included is a figure stand with Groot nameplate and movie logo as well as two Potted Baby Groots . <p> The hands that it come with actually have bendable fingers , which make the partially clenched palms rather unnecessary . Naturally , with bendy fingers , your inner 13 year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I digress. - For the left hand , with the glow effect , it would have been nice if it featured a light up feature but the effect- is serviceable . E.T . ai n't  got nothing on Groot . <p> Little potted Groot dancing his branches off was arguably the most memorable moment from Guardians of The Galaxy . Its an absolute necessity to have the potted Groot to coincide with the figure . Downside is both- potted Groot and dancing Groot only comes with collectible set ( with the latter being a limited Sideshow Collectibles exclusive ) . - If you wanted to buy the Groot figure as a standalone , it does not come with a potted Groot accessory . The pot themselves have nice texturing , and the paint app on both- Groot 's looks really well rendered . Neither Potted Groot have any articulation . Albeit very cute looking , they 're just stationary pieces of sculpted plastic . <p> Back to adult Groot <p> The detail on the figure is astonishing . A myriad of roots , branches , vines , bark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out details go so far that they even carry on to the bottom of the feet an unnecessary but appreciated level of extra detail . <p> Painting organic-like constructs are difficult and could easily look monochromatic . This- figure is anything but. - - Groot is washed with earthly color tones of brown , green , and a yellowish/grey tint all layered to a very life-like effect . Looks so much like plant life- that you may in a night of drunken debauchery- - water him along with the rest of your house plants #truestory . <p> The articulation on such a large- figure would seem , well , franklywooden . However , Groot is surprisingly limber , having 15 points of articulation. - The upper torso twists to almost 180 degrees motion . The trunks of his feet are on a ball joint and rotate completely around . - The arms are a little stiff , feeling like you 'll break them at the elbow when you attempt to bend them in various positions . <p> Most of the figures articulation points are masked really well under the guise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groin , shoulders , knees and ankles . Even the hips have little flap coverings that push up when you want to raise/bend the hips and hide what would other wise be a big split in the crotch. - The elbows joints , though , stick out like a sore thumb . You see those exposed joints and the illusion of a life-like figure gets taken back a notch , reminding you that you 're a grown adult playing with a doll . <p> Even with the articulation cuts the sculpt is seamless from head to toe , or trunk in this case . - The giant feet are also lovely because he does n't feel like he 'll ever fall down . - They anchor him extremely well. - His stand is completely unnecessary unless you want to anchor Rocket on his shoulder , or you have an OCD that all your figures must be on matching stands . <p> Groot is a towering presence on the shelf but he is incomplete without is snarky fury friend , Rocket Raccoon . <p> Hot Toys Rocket Raccoon looks good , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fierce and neutral. - An open mouth would have been preferred the same aggressive face as seen on the package would have been awesome . Do n't  know why , for such a small figure , an alternative head wasnt included . Granted the personality in the face is lacking , the light gleaming off his beady pupils give an eerily life-like set of eyes . The head also features plugged whiskers , that while are a nice effect , are scraggly and all over the place . I have a bent whisker on mine that I just can not straighten out and drives me nuts ! I do n't  have OCD but I just might after futzing with this figure . <p> His orange jump suit is made 100% real cloth material and is a hand tailored- recreation of the movie . With a distressed look , brace strapping clasping , stitching , and fabric knee pads ; it is the one over-all piece that elevates this figure from toy to high-end collectible. - I du n no what 's up with the blue marble on his back pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie maybe its a bowling ball . I can see Rocket being on a galactic bowling team and that 's how I 'm gon na go on picturing it as . <p> The pants are tight and do limit his motion in the thigh and knee area . The arms are limited as well , with the single bend elbow joints barely achieving 90% . The tail is on a ball joint and gets a full range of motion . The arms and- tail do pop off so easily and the pegs on the tiny hands and feet feel like they 're easily susceptible to snapping off , thankfully he comes with extra pegs . The figures greatest range of motion is in the head , with there being joints below the neck and above the chest . Given that Rocket has 2 extra points of articulation over Groot , you 'd be surprised to find that you get more poseability with humanoid tree trunk than you do Rocket . A combination of the outfit restrictions and limited articulation points makes him quite hard to pose . He also falls over really easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints and you have him hold a an oversized gun , what do you think is gon na happen ? A light fart will knock him over . <p> Painting fur is a really difficult thing to do , and not something that even Hot Toys has n't  quite mastered . While faux fur is something you always want to see of fur based characters , - with the shape and size of the figure , its not something they would have been able to pull off either . It is a adequate- paint job , having done the best they could with the materials they were working with . So its not that it looks bad , there 's just a toyish look to it . He- does look better , by leaps and bounds , than anything currently on the market ; including the Marvel Legends figure and NECAs life-size Rocket Raccoon . <p> Rocket comes with the oversized gun you 've seen him toting. - - The gun has so many layers and pieces with a impressive paint job matching the metal and chrome-like accents as featured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Rockets hand . I made more than one angry Groot face trying to finagle the gun in Rockets paw . <p> Also paired with Rocket are a 2 extra sets of hands ( 1 ) pair of relaxed palms , ( 1 ) pair of fists , ( 1 ) pair of palms holding rifle , and a set of bended feet/paws , as well as a figure stand with name plate . <p> If you 're buying Rocket because you 're a fan of Rocket , you may be a little disappointed. - He s a diminutive figure based on a- marsupial , Hot Toys sculptures and painters- were boxed in the corner when tasked with making this . <p> Rocket and Groot together , though , make for one heck of a display piece . Buying one and not the other would be like buying Batman without Robin , or like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the jelly . <p> When then- Guardians of the Galaxy movie was first announced , I initially balked at the idea . A movie with a talking humanoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought it was going to work . If you asked me then if I ever thought about dropping a few hundred on a pair of Rocket and Groot collectible figures , I would have laughed at you . I , of course , know better now . Guardians of the Galaxy is an outrageously entertaining movie , and Rocket &amp; Groot have become the best cinematic duo since Jay and Silent Bob. - These collectibles are the truest forms of pop culture worship . And , yeah , they 're a few things to nit pick at but this figure set will have you- humming the Jackson 5s " I want you back " and dancing your way off to happiness . <p> As always when it 's Hot Toys , this- Marvel Rocket and Groot Sixth Scale figure combo is n't exactly cheap " it 'll set you back $359 all together , or $199 for Groot and $159 for Rocket individually . Maybe you only have the budget for one figure at a time , but it is worth it to get the set . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

I still have the entire run of Marvels King Conan series in my collection , so when word started making the Internet rounds about The Legend of Conan , I was excited . Now that we all know it is happening sooner rather than later , were starting to hear some bits and pieces on what the movie will be about . This time around producer Chris Morgan and the movies star Arnold Schwarzenegger clue us in on some possibilities. - <p> Let 's start with Schwarzenegger . He recently chatted with Nerd Report and had this to say : <p> I was hoping to do another one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , then just threw it all away and went into retirement and went off into the mountains . That whole idea always appealed to me . Then of course he gets asked back because of some hideous and unbelievable things that are happening to the kingdom .

I want the guy who 's not necessarily lost a step , but there 's some rust he has to shake off . I want to embrace that .

The aged hero , more myth than fact now , a body betraying him as he makes his last stand , incredible stuff that would translate well on the big screen .

@@36130258 @5130258/ <p> Back in 2002 , Vin Diesel re-teamed with his The Fast and the Furious director Rob Cohen to make xXx , a so-called spy-thriller meant to upset the stiff , upper-crusty world of James Bond with a down and dirty modern riff full of nihilists , tattooed bad boys and extreme sports freaks . Of course , Pierce Brosnans final Bond movie , Die Another Day , came out later that year and by box office proved handily that the gentleman spy was in no danger of being usurped by those that think a tux and a t-shirt with a picture of a tux on it are roughly the same . <p> That , shall we say , populist view of modern spy war by xXx was on my mind after watchingKingsman : The Secret Service , the new movie by Matthew Vaughn that is very much of the opinion that " manners maketh the man . " Basically , if you can kick ass with an umbrella , you can kick ass with just about anything , and while anyone can be a thug , it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with calm , rational composure . And what is the more dangerous : someone who flies off the handle , or someone who can keep their head even as all around them are losing theirs ? <p> Pretty stuffy , right ? Not hardly . Kingsman is a frenzied beast that frequently threatens to overwhelm the senses , daring you to keep up . Vaughns recent ventures into blockbuster action , Kick-Ass andX-Men : First Class , both have a subversive quality in terms of audience expectations , and they both walk a fine line between the campy and the rational . Kick-Ass in particular manages to be satirical and straightforward , pulverizing your senses with over the top violence and characterization that still manages to get at something real and insightful . <p> Kingsman is just about as silly as anything produced as spy drama in the 60s . It features a top secret organization made-up of well-tailored men with funny nicknames and a myriad of gadgets struggling to stop a megalomaniac with an over-the-top scheme to take over the world for vaguely altruistic reasons . Our hero though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class bloke that 's failed at everything except finding new ways to get into trouble . " Eggsy " Unwin ( Taron Egerton ) has an abusive stepfather whose a small time hooligan , he cant do anything to get his mom and stepsister out of their predicament , and he has no direction in life . But what he does have , naturally , is above average skill <p> The star of Kingsman though is Colin Firth , an actor who won an Academy Award for playing King George VI in The Kings Speech , and is still beloved for his turn as Mr. Darcy in the 90s TV miniseries version of Pride and Prejudice . In Kingsman though , he s an action movie revelation on par with Matt Damon in the first Bourne Identity movie , he s skilled enough to make you wonder what he has n't  been cast as a man of action before , which plays right into the idea of underestimating the dangerousness of the guy in the glasses and double-breasted bespoke suit . <p> Much of the plot flows the back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigation by Firths character , codenamed Galahad , into the mysterious disappearance of a number of high-profile figures . The villain , coincidentally enough given the occasion , is Valentine ( Samuel L. Jackson ) , a Steve Jobs-like technology magnate with a hair-brained scheme to save the planet by basically getting rid of most of the people . Like all traditional Bondian villains , Valentine is slightly off , speaking with a lisp and balking at the sight of blood , and he has an Odd-Job like hench(wo)man in Gazelle ( Sofia Boutella ) , who 's armed with artificial legs that basically double as swords . <p> Describing the plot of Kingsman captures the very sense of ludicrousness that Vaughn and his screenwriting collaborator Jane Goldman are going for , but it cant convey the sheer audacity of the direction , the edge of your seat thrills of some of the action sequences , and the almost farcical level of blood and gore that sometimes shocks you to the point of laughter . There 's also a degree of meta-commentary too , as the characters know they 're living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crazy bad guy with an unnecessarily overly elaborate plan to become king of the world . <p> Vaughn manages to juggle those various desperate elements with tremendous skill , for the most part . Whenever the action goes up in the air , like during the climax or during an earlier training sequence where the cadets leap from a plane , its thrillingly frantic . The fight scenes are all exceptionally well choreographed , and although I think there 's maybe too much shaky cam going on at times , there 's a definite level of artistry in how the fight sequences are shot , and one of the few instances where the movie shows the grittiness of a modern spy movie . Mostly though , Kingsman is shot in bright colorful pallets , sunny as in the light in which its shot if not its disposition . <p> Credit should also go to the cast , and enough ca n't be said about Firth who unsurprisingly can play a gentleman well , but can also carry those fights as if he were someone with the resume of Jean-Claude Van Damme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentee , a relationship that does n't  seem forced at all , and never condescending on the part of Galahad to Eggy in any way . Mark Strong as fellow Kingsman Merlin gets a rare chance to be a good guy , and manages to be quite humorous playing the Kingsmens Q. Jackson gets to be the slightly deranged version of his bad ass self , something I do n't  think we 've seen on-screen in a while , and Michael Caine adds a touch of class and a bit of twist as the Kingsmens leader Arthur . <p> Its not all perfect though . There 's a fairly big action scene near the end of the second act where everything turns , and the plot unfolds a little too closely to the way things turned out in Kick-Ass , thematically and narratively . The source material for both films was a comic book written by Mark Millar , but the plot for both turns on the mentored having to cast aside all doubts and becoming embroiled in an ultra-violent final showdown that 's as notable for its high body count as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vaughn makes it work in the end , but the films flow gets upset as it races to its climax , and the director tries to compensate with a great big body count . <p> Still , one leaves the theater imminently satisfied at having viewed a wickedly entertaining and endlessly appealing action movie that features fun characters , cool sequences , and a wink and a nod to films and series beloved by those that miss the dapper days of spying . True , Bond still puts on a tux , but he s now too busy being broody and intimidating to mix an etiquette lesson in with his world saving , so someone should . Let is be the Kingmen then ! Let 's welcome well-tailored heroism again . It turns out , its still pretty bad ass . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

The new film based on the 2012 hit revisionist fairy tale will be under the guidance of Shawshank Redemption filmmaker and- Walking Dead TV series creator Frank Darabont , his first film since the Stephen King adaptation The Mist in 2007 . Not only is Darabonts involvement the rumor du jour about the project , but sources are saying this sequel will tilt a little more towards one character in the title than the other . <p> According to The Wrap , Darabont is close to making his involvement official , but has yet to sign on the dotted line .

Reportedly , its one in which Snow White , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a small role if she ends up having any role in the film at all . Instead , the emphasis will be on Chris Hemsworths character , the Huntsman , including an appropriate title change to reflect the new choice of lead character .

First , Hemsworth is arguably now a bigger star than Stewart after his appearance in two Thor movies as well as The Avengers and its upcoming sequel . Secondly , shrinking Stewarts involvement helps the production avoid all that icky business that went on between the first films director , Rupert Saunders , and his leading lady . No one likes that kind of gossip ( I think ) . <p> Its believed that Charlize Theron will return to her play the Evil Queen , which is a good thing because she was easily one of the best parts of the film .

The Wachowskis , who wrote the script as well as directed the film , once again leans mighty heavily on the " Chosen One " trope , and if comparisons to The Matrix come easily its only because the hero of the story is a menial drone in a dead end job dreaming of something more only to be taken to a fantastical and impossible world where they are the most important person in creation . Except in Jupiter Ascending , the hero is a woman . <p> Mila Kunis is the titular Jupiter , named for the gas giant by her astronomer father who was killed before she was born . She spends her days cleaning houses with her Russian mother and aunt , long days that start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never own and the upscale living that she will never have . Naturally , it turns out she 's the reincarnation of the Queen of the Universe , and holds title over the Earth , not to mention several other planets . And like any one percenter , Jupiter is about to be rewarded thanks to the prudence of smart and thorough estate planning . <p> But this is n't just some galactic Beverly Hill Billies . Behind the purposefully elaborate fashions , hologram tattoos and awesome spaceships is the battle between the Queens children over their inheritance : Balem ( Eddie Redmayne ) , Titus ( Douglas Booth ) , and Kalique ( Tuppence Middleton ) . They all want Jupiter dead , or at least penniless and divested of her inheritance . There is a hero in this story though , a former soldier named Caine Wise ( Channing Tatum ) who arrives on Earth as a kind of bounty hunter looking for Jupiter on behalf of Titus , but soon becomes Jupiters white knight , protecting her from all three of the trio of siblings that want their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that was as simple as I could make the plot , would you be surprised ? The biggest problem with the film is that you do n't  know who to trust , whose motivations are true , and who is saying what they 're saying just to gain Jupiters trust . This is like Reservoir Dogs with prosthetics at times , as Jupiter bounces back and forth from one alien to another telling her that they 're the one she can trust the most . Then there 's a betrayal and were onto another spaceship and another would be savior . It should bother me more , but I 've watched The Fifth Element 20 times and damned if I can figure out what the big evil fireballs endgame is or why Rich Texan Gary Oldman is working so hard to appease it . <p> Basically , the plot is a convenient tool that the filmmakers can use to show off the worlds of Jupiter Ascending , which are all amazing , but perhaps they could have been shown off by only having Redmayne as the villain instead of watering it down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have used the extra time to flesh out Balem some more because the character traits he uses to make it known that Balem is evil involves talking in a strained whisper and sitting on a throne like he s constipated . Considering that Balems evil empire includes talking , flying lizard men in leather coats , as well as a super-villain base inside Jupiters eye ( the planet , not the girl ) , the character should be having more fun , and not seem vaguely bored by the goings on . <p> Redmaynes laid back villainy lays on one extreme end , on the other , the film gets so busy you cant follow along with what 's going on . Its impossible . The Wachowskis camera is so obsessed with the idea that it captures every square inch of the action at times , it feels like you 're watching a pinball game from inside the game and the balls point of view . Like a lot of blockbuster movies , the production design sometimes gets preoccupied with how cool something looks that practically speaking it makes no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an action scene early on when Chicago , once again , gets fragged by transforming aliens , or rather their ships . <p> Well that all sounds like I hated Jupiter Ascending , but really they were hiccups . Blips that made my mind stop the enjoyment and jump to more analytical places that I think the movie really does n't  want you to go . If this were an intergalactic version of Brewsters Millions , the film could have been free to have fun , but I guess the Wachowskis and/or the studio felt that space opera needs life and death stakes rather than just being cool with an Earth woman and her half-dog/half-man protector dealing with a Vogon like universal bureaucracy . <p> There are times when Kunis looks a bit in over her head , especially against big budget action veterans like Tatum and Sean Bean , but I think she holds her own in the end . Tatum , meanwhile , proves he can do anything with Caine , executing all the demands of the script from the silly " I have more in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he really was running across the skyline of Chicago in gravity boots . In those scenes , as Caine uses what can only be described as " space parkour " to outrun the other bounty hunters out for Jupiter , the directors skill with combining practical stunts and effects work really shines . In fact , the film does an excellent job overall of combining practical props and effects with computerized worlds , and the 3-D accentuated the film nicely while not being overwhelming . ( I 'll admit though I rarely indulge in 3-D anymore so my palette in regards to the technology may be way off . ) <p> The point I 'm trying to make is that Jupiter Ascending is fun , despite not being perfect . Since something like it , a huge studio action movie not based on anything , is such a rare creature these days , I think were of the opinion that its life-altering because how could anything less make it past the censors and the bean counters . But maybe someone just thought this was going to look awesome , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record that was n't exactly the wrong thing to expect . If that 's all you 're expecting than Jupiter Ascending is a treat . If you just want to kill a couple of hours , much on popcorn , and get swept off into a space adventure , then the Wachowski accomplished what they set out to do , I think . <p> Let 's all come back in 18 years and decide once and for all what this movie really means . For right now , let 's just enjoy the ride . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804 
@@36130287 @5130287/ <p> While Sony tries to recover from hacking attacks and the aftermath of its decision to pull Seth Rogan and James Francos The Interview from theaters , the movie business still goes on . Sony has just closed a deal that might result in a new franchise for the embattled studio . Robert Rodriquez will direct a live action Fire and Ice movie based on the animated movie by Frank Frazetta and Ralph Bakshi . <p> It all sprang from the incredible artwork of Frank Frazetta pictured below . <p> In 1983 , Frazetta and Bakshi made the animated film which quickly became a bootleg favorite at all the video duping booths youd find at just about every comic book convention back in the day . You know the one with all those black and white photo copied VHS covers slipped into the bulky plastic black cases . Maybe you felt a little dirty buying it , but where else could you get it ? There was no Internet back then ! <p> Rodriquez has been trying to bring this project to the big screen for years . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con. in an attempt to stir up fan and studio interest in the project . <p> Heres Rodriquezs synopsis for the planned live action movie : <p> From his stronghold in Ice Peak , the evil Nekron sends forth a wave of deadly glaciers , forcing humanity to retreat to Fire Keep , a kingdom ruled by a generous king . When King Jarol 's daughter Teegra is kidnapped , young warrior Larn teams with the mysterious and legendary Dark Wolf , to rescue the princess and the realm from Nekron 's evil sorcery . <p> This is n't just another movie for Rodriquez , he was a long time friend to Frank Frazetta . <p> I 'm a lifelong Frazetta fan who was inspired by his work , like so many people . It was my dream to work with him , and the first thing I did when I got to Hollywood was call him . I got him to do a From Dusk Till Dawn poster for me , and I got to work with him and know him over the years . When I 'd visit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure what would the ultimate Frazetta movie be . <p> I remembered the movie he did , Fire And Ice , back when I was a kid . I thought , I wish they could have made it look more like the paintings , but I guess they 'd have had to paint each frame . ' Now , you could do that . You could make it look like you were in his imagination . He did n't use models , he did n't use swipes . He painted purely from his imagination , and the characters and the colors made you feel like you were in a dream , and a fully realized and completely imagined world . It was so visual and arresting . <p> If we get the script in the next couple months , by the end of spring or start of summer , we start preproduction . <p> No word yet on who might take on the scripting chores , but it looks like this project is moving forward and gaining momentum . As things develop and casting begins , well bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated movie we 've embeded it below so you can check it out . Remember that it was 1983 when this was made by Frazetta and Bakshi , so if you 're expecting a Pixar movie , you might just want to move along . <p> What 's truly interesting about this animated movie is its use of Rotoscoping which was created by the legendary animator Max Fleischer . It was first used to create Out of the Inkwell that debuted in 1915 . <p> That 's where an animator traces over footage of live action scenes , frame by frame . That explains why you see a list of Performers and a list of voice actors for each part . So not only did they first have to shoot the scenes in costume , then they had to translate the footage and animate each frame of film . <p> Performers : <p> Randy Norton " Larn <p> Cynthia Leake " Teegra <p> Steve Sandor " Darkwolf <p> Sean Hannon " Nekron <p> Leo Gordon " Jarol <p> William Ostrander " Taro <p> Eileen ONeill " Juliana <p> Elizabeth Lloyd Shaw " Roleil <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Yank " Monga <p> Greg Wayne Elam " Pako <p> Voice cast : <p> Susan Tyrrell " Juliana <p> Maggie Roswell " Teegra <p> William Ostrander " Larn <p> Stephen Mendel " Nekron <p> Alan Koss " Envoy <p> Clare Nono " Tutor <p> Hans Howes " Defender Captain <p> Ray Oliver " Subhuman <p> Nathan Purdee " Subhuman <p> Le Tari " Subhuman <p> You might notice a few of those names , you 've heard Maggie Roswells voice on The Simpsons as the voice of Maude Flanders . <p> I 've loved Frazetta and Bakshis work for a long time .

The Calgary Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo celebrated its 10th anniversary with an amazing line-up of guests and exhibitors for a record shattering 102,000 faithful fans . <p> First up , since many of you do not reside in the great white north , if you 've never attended a Canadian con , you are really missing out . Just remember most of your favorite TV shows and movies are made north of the wall , and once again the Calgary Expo proved to be a fantastic place to celebrate this whole nerd/geek/pop-culture universe that we all live in and love . <p> What follows is a whirlwind overview of an- amazing weekend . <p> The star-studded line-up of guests crossed both genre and era with notable appearances by the guys from 90210 , together again for the first time since the show ended ( which was before more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jason Priestly and , Ian Ziering , before he was taking chainsaws to tornadod sharks . ) Stars from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , Brent Dalton and Ming Na Wen , were also in attendance . <p> For DC TV fans Arrow ( Stephen Amell , ) Diggle ( David Ramsey , ) Firestorm ( Robbie Amell , ) Constantine ( Matt Ryan , ) and Rip Hunter ( look I know many of you are crying out , " but Arthur Darvill is Rory from Doctor Who , " well he was , but now he s Rip and since both characters are time travelers things will get very confusing if we continue to argue about this . ) <p> Now , before this turns into me just listing names , just let me say- that they packed the program with something for everyone . From Star Trek to The Walking Dead to voice actors like Peter Cullen , Tom Kenny , Alan Oppenheimer and top-tier cosplayers like Ivy Doom Kitty and Jessica Nigri Sorry , I started just listing names again there , did n't  I ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on hand ? <p> If you are looking for a couple of pull quotes from the Calgary Expo , well the inarguably awesome Neil Patrick Harris was on hand and yes he did give an update on a Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog sequel . " We have a script and songs written for it but Joss keeps making these gagillion dollar movies " said Harris , adding that they- were- close to starting production but Joss Whedon had to delay it to make that plucky little movie called The Avengers : Age of Ultron , so maybe it is safe for us to assume well get more Dr. Horrible soon ? Please ? <p> Another newsworthy moment came from Jason Mamoa , and while he was upfront and honest that he couldnt- say much about playing Aquaman on the big screen , he did display confidence in Zack Snyders vision for the DC Comics cinematic universe adding that he has met with DC Comics Geoff Johns ( who is , apparently a beast ) and then closed with " like it or not , I 'm the new fucking Aquaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes sir , sorry for questioning you- oh great and powerful lord of Atlantis. <p> Arthur Darvill <p> Stephen Amell <p> Jason Momoa <p> Gwendoline Christie <p> The Walking Dead Panel <p> Neil Patrick Harris <p> Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D .

Highlights included the man behind the DC Animated Universe , Bruce Timm , a delightful gentleman that we owe many thanks to the endless enduring ours of cartoons he gave us , the legendary Preacher/Punisher writer Garth Ennis , and arguably one of the bests artists in comics today , Jae Lee among many , many others. - As for a personal highlight , grabbing 5 minutes with the guys behind the wonderfully twisted webcomic- Cyanide and Happiness ( Rob DenBleyker , Kris Wilson , Dave McElfatrick , ) was a blast and I got to walk away with an on-the-spot , one-off-a-kind , **30;368;TOOLONG , comic titled Taco Pole Dancing that will amuse me till the end of time . <p> Garth Ennis and Jacen Burrows <p> Jae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this type is lives and breathes on the exhibitor and vendor floor , and at the Calgary Expo- delivered the experience perfectly .

Well there was n't , the whole atmosphere on the floor was smooth and the crowds ebbed and flowed easily ( and since were Canadians , politely . ) <p> I want to take a moment to address just how kid friendly - the Calgary Expo was . As a father of the next generation of nerds , an all ages type environment- is something that is important to me . Besides , admit it , when you see an 8-year-old dressed up as The Flash- you feel secure in the knowledge that this grand obsession we 've harbored all these years will be carried on for years to come .

With my long-standing policy of not feeding the trolls I 'm not going to name names or go into great detail ( if you want a good rundown- Jill Pantozzi over at the Mary Sue did a great write-up of what happened here . ) I would just like to say that the organizers of the event handled it professionally and perfectly . When the individuals that gained access under false pretenses were identified and their less than friendly intentions brought to light , they were removed . It is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined guidelines and rules of the Expo itself , but the enjoyment of the event for the rest of us . Simply put , people came from far and wide for four days of fun and widespread geekery , 102,000 of us in fact , and the Calgary Expo is- not a political platform for half a dozen individuals to try to knock out a soapbox diatribe or two , its for those that love the things we love to group up and be in the middle of it all . The organizers of the Calgary Expo have a responsibility to us , the other 101,994 attendees and they did a great job living up to that responsibility and , if I may speak for the majority , we thank them for it . <p> As for this vocal little minority ? before the- misappropriated the calls of free speech for all ring out , no one is taking that from them .

Maybe it was n't the smartest or most appropriate venue to pick for that- particular flavour of activism . Plus , any accusations of discrimination or unfair treatment fall a bit short when the handful of individuals in question chose subterfuge and deceit as a course of action . Makes one question how confident that little table was in this cause they want to shout so loudly about . <p> The Comic &amp;- Entertainment Expo Group ( the ones behind the Calgary Expo and sister events in Edmonton and Saskatoon ) - have made equality and inclusiveness a mandate and a priority for their events and from where I am standing I can say with confidence they are doing a great job . Its a place where those that love what we love can come together and share and enjoy ( inadvertent obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its a place where even the most adherent DC and Marvel fans can meet and find a new understanding of each other and perhaps one day learn to love each other as brothers and sisters . Unless of course you come at me with that whole Iron Man is better than Batman stuff I will shut you down , son . <p> With the 10th Annual Calgary Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo now but a pleasant memory , I think my main take way ( besides the fist full of new books to read , stack of business cards thick enough to choke a baby walrus and all the other wonderful nerdy little things I picked up over the weekend , ) is simply that I 'm sad for missing out on the last nine of these , a mistake I wont be making in the future . Luckily the fine folk behind the Calgary Expo have the Saskatoon Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo ( Sept 19-20 ) and the Edmonton Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo ( Sept 25-27 ) coming up on the horizon , and both are events I would encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With cosplay being such a huge part of celebrating nerd culture , the Calgary Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo is a hotbed of some great , jaw dropping , amusing , entertaining , and ( before I run out of adjectives ) fun work from fans and pros a like .

With his recent announcement that he has finished and handed in the script for Warner Bros. tentatively proposed Justice League Dark adaptation , and having wrapped filming for his next directorial feature Crimson Peak ( set for an October 17 2015 release ) , now " during promotional rounds for the DVD and Blu-ray release of FXs The Strain " he has also been discussing the Pacific Rim 2 script that he has been developing ( does this man ever sleep , seriously ? ! ) . Guillermo has been elaborating on some plot details for the follow-up to the International Kaiju smashing blockbuster hit Pacific Rim , and it sound like we are going to be seeing more of Charlie Days Dr. Newton Geiszler , and Burn Gormans Gottlieb . <p> Guillermo has announced that they have been written into the script and that some of the characters from the original film will not be back for the sequel although there is a chance some could return for the third installment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first one ( which is always nice to hear ) , with Day and Gorman featuring more prominently in the second part of the Jaeger vs .

Most of the comedic elements came from the two argumentative scientists Dr Newton Geiszler and Gottlieb , so it will be interesting to see what kind of tone the second film is going to have . However , the idea that it is going to be slightly different and not a complete rehash of the first film is good news , but that was to be expected from del Toro ( just like Hellboyand Hellboy : The Golden Army were tonally different ) . What do you reckon peeps ? <p> They are hoping that the script will be finished- in spring 2015 , with a provisional shooting date set for sometime at the end of 2015. 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Anyway , were starting to get some legitimate plot details about the next phase in the Terminator franchise , Genisys , which comes out next summer and , if all goes according to plan , it will be the first in a new trilogy of Terminator films . A lot has remained unknown about the film , including where in the Terminator timeline the movie will fit , and what role Arnold Schwarzeneggers paradoxically Old Terminator will have in it , but this new information from a very reliable source makes me wonder if that Terminator resurgence just might be in the cards after all . Or , you know , gullible . <p> The issue of Entertainment Weekly delivers the compelling Terminator news along with two new covers featuring actors from the film .

Sarah is then raised by a T-800 model Terminator that 's " programmed to guard rather than to kill . " She calls him " Pops " but being raised by a cyborg that knows your future does n't  do much for your human disposition because as Sarah grows up she 's " great with a sniper rifle but not so skilled at the nuances of human emotion .

Let 's take a look at the covers from EW : <p> Ah yes , Doctor Who Matt Smith is in the film , and while the identity of his role is n't revealed here , he does appear on the EW cover with Jason Clarke as John Connor , thus suggesting at least what time period Smiths character is from and who he has a relationship with in the film .

@@36130311 @5130311/ <p> Sony 's making moves to get their Spider-Man ball rolling so they can perhaps catch up with some of the bigger players in the comic book movie game . They 've got plans for a Sinister Six flick , a third ( and fourth and fifth ) Amazing Spider-Man film and there are several other spin-off movies in the works . Today we here at Nerd Bastards bring you a couple of tidbits concerning how Sony 's franchise is doing . Hear the latest rumors about a 2017 female-centric Spidey movie and the title of the upcoming Venom-themed movie . <p> First and foremost , it looks like Sony is going to be joining Warner Bros. in bringing a female super hero to the big screen . Though the exact identity of the lady in question still remains a mystery , the two obvious choices are either Spider-Woman or the Black Cat . Lisa Joy Nolan ( Pushing Daisies ) has been hired to write the script for the mystery flick and the release is said to be set for sometime in 2017 . Whether they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go that route ) is also a mystery . <p> Personally , I 'm pulling for a Black Cat flick . We 've already got one spider-themed hero and Sony might do well to branch out instead of confusing people ( the non-comic book readers , that is ) . Though seeing Spider-Woman on the screen sometime in the future would be pretty damned awesome . <p> Our second bit of news involves the rumored title for the upcoming Spider-Man spin-off that will feature Venom as the main character . And that title is Venom Carnage . Yeah , maybe not the most original name ever , but it does give a little hint about what we might expect . Venom and Carnage are two major Spidey villains and if Sony decides to bring them both to the screen at once , it could be an interesting ride . It would also be a good way to get audiences cheering for Venom , a character that might otherwise not capture the hearts and minds of the typical movie-goer . Carnage is a hell-of-a-lot worse than his black counterpart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venom flick goes , Sony has Alex Kurtzman ( Amazing Spider-Man 2 , Star Trek Into Darkness ) and Ed Soloman ( Bill &amp; Ted 's Excellent Adventure , Men in Black ) working on the script and Kurtzman will be lending his directing skills to the project . They plan on releasing the movie sometime in 2017 , which would drop it in the same year as the above-mentioned female-centric Spidey film . <p> Brace yourselves , folks . We could be in for a huge mess of Spider-Man action over the next couple of years . Let 's just hope that it all turns out to be better than the last Amazing Spider-Man flick or the mediocrity may very well kill the franchise forever . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804 
@@36130313 @5130313/ <p> Two words : Freakin amazing . A few quick thoughts on the weekend and a metric tonne of cosplay follow . <p> Let me start out by saying this was n't my first ( geek ) rodeo . Ive been to my share of cons ( and even had a hand in organizing one a few years ago , ) and to be honest many of those have been first year type things and I know first hand that there can be a few stumbles when you invite 8,800+ new friends over to talk about who is the best Doctor and explore the finer points of adamantium metal working . Thats ( partly ) why I 'm so impressed by the work done by the Saskatoon Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo organizers ( who are also the people behind the- Edmonton and Calgary Expos . ) They did an absolutely phenomenal job . If they encountered any of the dreaded first year gremlins it certainly was n't evident and I was on-site for both days of the convention . <p> From the moment you passed through the gate and onto the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Artist Alley and the Creator Guest area was full with a lot to see and the various vendors in attendance were on par with ( if not better than ) most other shows that I 've been to . As you 'll see in the forthcoming photo gallery , the crowd deserves a few kudos as well . The attendance records for similar events in the city were shattered by the Saskatoon Expo , and it was clear that many attendees were on hand to enjoy both days . The aisles were packed ( yet polite , we are Canadians after all , ) and there was some great cosplay on hand . There was even a cosplay theme wedding at the event , insert " holy Bat-rimony " pun here . <p> Quick note on the cosplay : I made a rookie mistake and went with a cheap SD card so I was only able to capture a fraction of the picture worthy sights , people and events . Thankfully , our collection of pictures has been supplemented by Christopher Pugh and Maryanne Hill from- Justice League Saskatoon. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrity guests , the panels included Nightmare On Elm Streets- Robert Englund , - Nana Visitor from Star Trek : - Deep Space Nine , - Phil Lamarr from Futurama and Mad TV , and X-Mens Sabertooth , Tyler Mane .

Also in attendance was- Lance Henriksen , - Brandon Routh ( who gave the best line of the weekend when he announced that he is technically still Superman , he just does n't  get paid to be anymore ) and the insanely entertaining crowd pleasing entity known as John Barrowman . I wont try and summarize the panels because let 's be honest , at any convention the panels are always a " you had to be there " kind of thing . And you really should have . I know that the convention season keeps growing and growing and that it is hard to pick and choose which ones you should choose to attend , but trust me : the Saskatoon Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo- is one you should really think about looking into for next year . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bigger and better . <p> Besides , John Barrowman said that he had a blast and that he was going to tell all of his celebrity friends that the Saskatoon Expo is worth checking out .

I do n't know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this self-imposed prison and the reason he locked eyes is essentially so we can feel as uncomfortable as he does in his world . He 's someone who was just moments from taking that final step toward humanity who then has to face himself as the monster he believes he is and decide his own fate . He gives himself what he deserves . I do n't think in that moment he 's fighting the urge to kill ; he 's dealing with the reality of the misery of his life in that moment . <p> And then Buck went on to talk about his decision in shooting the ending that they did : <p> I 've also heard that some viewers are not happy with this season , and they all have different reason for it . So much of the stuff you read is that people want the show to be like it was the first few years where Dexter would go out and kill people .

That everything we 've seen over the past eight seasons has happened in the several seconds from the time they start Dexter 's execution to the time they finish the execution and he dies . Literally , his life flashed before his eyes as he was about to die . I think it would have been a great , epic , very satisfying conclusion . <p> Well , I think that may have been a better take on it. - Of course , that would have depended on whether you were routing for Dex to survive at the end or not . <p> What do all the Nerd Readers think ? - Was the ending we got satisfactory to you ? - Or do you think Phillips would have handled it better ? 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

While we wait for that moment of worldwide celebration ( well , nerd world . What else matters ? ) show star John Barrowman has kept himself busy , co-writing a novel ( Hollow Earth ) with his sister , touring the convention circuit ( Barrowman will be at The Hollywood Show this weekend in Los Angeles ) , and co-starring in the CWs Arrow ( Barrowman assures us that " there 's a lot more interesting things for Malcolm Merlyn- that are going to appear both in this series and next series ) . <p> But while Barrowman has stayed active , its clear that the actor wants to get back to Cardiff , and in our exclusive interview , we discuss continuing Jacks story on the page , on the screen , what he thinks about the new Doctor , and his thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to write another Torchwood comic to continue the story ? <p> Barrowman : Oh gosh yeah , weve always said that we wanted to do another one . We 've actually had some interest I do n't  want to say from who about turning the Hollow Earth series the novels that my sister ( Carol E. Barrowman ) and I have written into a comic book or a graphic novel , which we think is totally awesome . I 've actually mentioned to Andrew Kreisberg and the guys over at Arrowthat I would be interested , my sister and I would like to do a Merlyn series of Arrow comics , or something like a little spin-off or a couple of one-offs for the Arrow comic series . But yeah , I love the comic book genre . So that 's why we would really be interested in doing it again , not only because you know , its not so much the dialogue you have to do , its the storytelling to the visual aspect , that 's what I really like . <p> Do you think you have played Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea . I mean , that 's not my decision , that 's a decision for the BBC . The thing is , I go around with Eve and people to these conventions and we see the humongous following that we have and also the hunger that there is for Torchwood . If Im asked to play Captain Jack Harkness again , I would do it at the drop of a hat . And also , the Arrow producers- have said that if Im asked to do something like that , they would let me . They would see that I was able to do it . I think there 's a lot more to tell , there 's a lot more out there . There are those missing years that Jack talked about , there 's how he becomes " The Face of Boe " , there 's all sorts of things . But its not up to me , its up to Russell , Julie Gardner , and the BBC . <p> As you said , you 're still a Doctor Who fan , so I assume that you still watch Doctor Who- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vortex manipulator do you ever feel a little envious over the special effects ? There 's a lot of money on the screen they do have cooler toys , they do get to ride dinosaurs . <p> Barrowman : You know what , and that 's great , but I never look at something else and go " Ugh , I 'm jealous " . I 'm not that kind of person . It was fantastic and it was great when we did it and the budget we did it on was phenomenal . To think that we did it with Torchwood on probably a quarter of the budget , or half of the budget that Doctor Who had was just amazing . And you know , for me to ride a dinosaur , Jack would probably be like " yeah , whatever , they 're gon na be extinct " . I 'm not envious , but it does thrill me to see that if we were to come back the big things that could be done with it . <p> How do you think Peter Capaldi will do as the Doctor ? <p> Barrowman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I answer that question for everybody , I have no idea because I have never seen him be the Doctor . I 've worked with him , I think he s a great actor . He was in- Torchwood : Children of Earth , he s also done some Doctor Who stuff , and he s just a brilliant actor . I think hell be very very good . Its very interesting the way they 've gone , first with Chris , then David , and then Matt being very young , and now theyve gone to someone who is Tom Bakers age when he started , as Peter is now . So its a very interesting step and I think it will be a good one . <p> Amazingly , were still trapped in a moment where gay intimacy begins and ends with a peck on the cheek on some TV shows . Obviously , Torchwood was n't shy about honestly approaching gay relationships with John Hart , with Ianto , and Angelo , but I kind of feel like the show does n't  get enough credit for that . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about if that was a conscious decision early on to not shy away from Jacks sexuality and was there any push-back from the BBC ? <p> Barrowman : There was never push-back from the BBC , but you 'll have to ask Russell , that 's a question really for Russell . But , I 'll put this from my perspective : I 'm an openly gay actor and of course I want to portray myself when I say myself , the character that I play is a gay character as close and as humanly possible or alienly possible as they should be , because in real life I do kiss passionately on the lips with my husband , we do have sex , we do fight , we do argue , we have ups and downs and were intimate and passionate with each other and that should be represented on television . If it has n't  gotten enough press , that 's not , you know , my fault in that way . But , I was never disappointed with the press that we got , I was kind of impressed that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people then were just accepting it in that way . So , for them to accept and not say much about it was a bigger accolade than to really go " Oh my god , dadadadada " , cause the first time I kissed the Doctor it just went over everybodys head . <p> John Barrowman will appear at The Hollywood Show this Saturday and Sunday at the Westin LAX in Los Angeles . The show will also feature a Twilight Zone reunion with Martin Landau and a Flash Gordon reunion .

@@36130325 @5130325/ <p> Once upon a time , Marvel Comics was being dragged hopelessly into bankruptcy .

In an new look inside the final Hobbit movie , The Hobbit : The Battle of the Five Armies , director Peter Jackson laid out just how big a battle with five armies can look like and some of the logistic challenges he faced creating , what looks to be , the most epic battle yet ever to take place on screen in Middle Earth . Of course , interest in The Hobbit is n't as strong as it was before the trilogy began in 2012 , but maybe with this were all interesting in going back to Middle Earth one last time <p> In a preview in Entertainment Weekly , Jackson talked about the effort and energy being invested in making the final Hobbit the biggest Middle Earth film yet . What does it mean ? Its quantitative actually , because according to the filmmaker , the final battle is going to be a whopping 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson was up to the challenge . " There 's a lot of logistics that have to be thought through , " he said of the battle in Battle . " We have dwarves and men and elves and orcs , all with different cultures , with different weapons , and different shields and patterns and tactics . " <p> You can see Jacksons sketch for the battle , which may be a bit spoilery , just after this image , which is being called the final poster for the film : <p> To give you some idea of the scale of the battle , EW published this sketch provided by Jackson . Amongst the detail is the use of eagles , which Jackson says he had to think carefully about using . " Original Hobbit author J.R.R. Tolkien uses eagles in a way that can be kind of awkward because they tend to show up out of the blue and change things pretty quickly , " he explained . " So here they 're just part of the plan , not the saviors . I mean , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring Frodo to Mount Doom in Lord of the Rings and let him drop the ring in , those movies would have been much shorter .

@@36130338 @5130338/ <p> Back when Saturday morning cartoons were the reason for our existence the majority of us were watching such classic action/adventure cartoons like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Transformers , G.I. Joe , Thundercats , He-Man and the Masters of The Universe and so on . In the mean time there were other- cartoons that either you did n't  knew existed or if you happen to catch one and tell your friends about it they would call shenanigans . In some cases if you were a child that had alot of toys , specifically action figures you probably had a toy or two that made you wonder where the hell it was from . In alpabetical order here are 12 action/adventure cartoons that you probably do n't  remember or have never seen . <p> Adventures of The Galaxy Rangers ( 1986 ) Late in the 21st century , the an organization called the Bureau of Extra-Terrestrial Affairs ( BETA ) is formed on Earth to keep peace in the galaxy . Joseph Walsh commands a team of genetically and technologically advanced rangers-Zachary Fox , Niko , Goose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Crown and her minions . This show weaves together aspects of westerns and science fiction into its setting . <p> Before Cowboy Beepop , Before Firefly and before anything you knew as Sci-Fi frontier there was Adventures of The Galaxy Rangers . Fucking amazing animation , top notch voice acting , cool intro song , well written episodes with memorable , individualistic characters . Really , a terrific cartoon . <p> Bionic 6 ( 1987 ) The Bionic Six are a diverse adopted family representing a cross cultural slice of the world . All of whom have been given super powers through the miracle of modern science . Together , they use these advanced cybornetic powers to defend the world from the evil Dr. Scarab and his lackies . <p> The Stories and writing were typical . The concept , - although feeling like an animated version of the 6 Million- Dollar- Man- was refreshing . The theme song was tacky but oh so wonderful and the animation was visually an- amazing production . The only thing that may have drove you nuts was that in pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Come on now , not only did no one wear a mask to conceal their identity but but they were a family consisting of two Caucasian kids , an African-American and an Asian kid . <p> Blackstar ( 1981 ) Astronaut John Blackstars shuttle passes through a black hole and crashes on the planet Sagar . He is rescued by the gentle Trobbits , who live under the tyranny of the Overload , possessor of one half of an all-powerful sword . Armed with the other half , Blackstar aids the resistance with his dragon , Warlock , the shape-shifter Klone ; and the sorceress , Mara . <p> For those that do n't  know Blackstar was actually the pre-curser to He-man and the Masters of the Universe . The shows actually shared some similarities such as in the use of repeated animation ( I.E. same shot of character running but with different background ) . Blackstar never shared the same success as He-man which is a shame as the show did deliver in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy department . Heroes , cool weapons , goofy sidekicks and random weirdness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s cartoons go that is . <p> Galtar and the Golden Lance ( 1985 ) Galtar and the Golden Lance was an outer space sword and sorcery affair featuring a light-hearted blonde warrior named Galtar . Searching for the vile Tormack , the despot responsible for the deaths of his parents , Galtar aligned himself with beautiful princess Goleeta and her feisty younger telekinetic brother Zorn . Goleeta and Zorn also had a score to settle with Tormack , whod stolen Goleetas magical golden shield . Tormack in turn coveted Galtars equally magical double-edged golden lance , for whosoever possessed both lance and shield would be all-powerful . <p> This was an excellent cartoon that captured the alluring aspect of sword and sorcery . The characters were a bit dull - and a bit too beautiful , honestly who wants to root for a typical , dreamy blond warrior ? Although if I must say so Princess Goldlita was looking fine ! The stories might not have been anything grand but overall the show was a perfect piece of action/adventure . <p> Jacye and The Wheeled Warriors ( 1985 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audric , a scientist accidentally creates The Monster Minds , a race of mutated plant creatures that goes on a rampage and sets out to take over the universe . In a bid to correct the creation of The Monster Minds , Audric creates a plant called " The Magic Root " which will destroy The Monster Minds , but The Magic Root got split into two pieces and half of the magic root is given to Audrics son Jayce . Joined by a team of fighters known as " The Lightning League " led by a 1000 year old wizard named Gillian , Jayce embarks on a desperate quest to find his father and put the two pieces of " The Magic Roots " together , which will destroy The Monster Minds and their evil leader , Sawboss . <p> Bizarre story but the writing was pretty mature . Great mix of Sci-Fi and fantasy . Of course plants turning into metal vehicles was a bit ridicules but besides that the show provided a real sense of action and adventure . The shows most redeeming quality had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best cartoon soundtracks ever . <p> Lazer Tag Academy ( 1986 ) Lazer Tag Academy is the story of Jamie Jaren , a thirteen year old Lazer Tag champion from 3010 who journeys back in time to stop the evil Draxon Drear . She joins with her ancestors , Tom , Beth and Nicky Jaren who also share her special powers . For most people , Starlites , the Lazer Tag " guns " are harmless toys . But for others , like the Jarens , they become weapons that allow them , along with the Star Sensor , allow them to travel in time , move object , ect . <p> For those of you that do n't  know Lazer Tag Academy was based on the highly popular Lazer Tag toy set . Awesome toys by the way . However this show was crap , just a means in which to advertise the toys . Bunch of retards running around with Laser gun toys in which allowed them to use Force " like powers . Some what fun but the characters were nothing special and the show really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intros voice over done by none other Don Lafontaine . <p> The Mighty Orbots ( 1984 ) In the future , Earth is threatened by various enemies , but none worse than the organization called Shadow , lead by the cybernetic menace known as Umbra . Against this , the Galactic Patrol strives to protect Earth , but the mild mannered young scientist , Robert Simmons , does more . In times of peril , he secretly fights as the leader of the Orbots , a team of unique artificially intelligent robots each equipped with their own unique capabilities that are invaluable in this war . Together , whether individually or united as parts of a giant combined robot , they represent Earths most powerful defense <p> A fun alternative to Robotech , Transformers and Voltron . It offered great animation , great action and even some good humor . Those robots were so dam lovable . Sadly the show did n't  make it past the first season because of a lawsuit from the makes of " The Gobots " . <p> Ring Raiders ( 1986 ) A Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throughout time , from the evil Skull Squadron . The Ring Raiders are made up of historys best pilots , brought together to protect civilization . <p> Another less than stellar cartoon . In fact I du n no if this show ever made it passed its pilot ( haha see what I did there ? ) . A show about time traveling fighting jets might have been cool when we were kids but in hindsight its a bit gay . Speaking of homoerotic innuendoes , Ring Raiders ? Sounds like a gay porn title . <p> Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs ( 1987-89 ) The series is set in the future , when humankind has reached the stars . There are many outposts and settlement worlds in the galaxy with Old West influenced names . There are also outlaws , bounty hunters and sheriffs . Saber Rider is the leader of the Star Sheriffs . The Star Sheriffs are the special operatives of Cavalry Command , their main assignment is to protect the Galaxy from the growing threat of the Outriders . <p> Space Sentinels ( 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One transported three young Earthlings to his domain granted them powers and eternal youth . Now they protect the human race from super-villains marauding aliens tampering time-travelers and vengeful deities . The trio of heroes super-strong Hercules shape-changing Astraea and lightning-fast Mercury have become legends guarding mankind as the Space Sentinels . <p> This is probably Filmations least attractive Cartoon Series , He-Man being the most . The show was more or less " Superfriends " in space . The story is simple enough , histories greatest heroes are gathered to defend a mystical realm . They kick butt , share the love and the story always has a moral . Fairly entertaining . <p> Starcom ( 1987 ) A short lived series that depicted the adventures of an American astronaut brigade as the fought off the attempted invasions by Shadow force , a nasty collection of aliens and robots led by the nefarious Emperor Dark <p> A cheesy but enthralling cartoon . It offered impeccable subject matter . It actually brought some sort of science fact into the science equation . ( i.e .. accurate depiction of the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Io when in direct sunlight , and so on ) The animation was typical for its day and the characters were a bit outlandish but at least the action figures were fun . The little space dudes had magnets on their feet and parents would find these guys everywhere , the refrigerator , the car , any metal surface of annoyance . <p> Vytor , The Star Fire Champion ( 1989 ) A legacy of legends , Civilization had done what man had always dreamed of doing , established a world of total peace . Then the greedy King of War , Myzor Sarcophogus , sought to capture the power of the Saturn Orb . He built a hidden fortress in the fiery heart of a living volcano , trained his secret army and then struck . In a single lightning moment , the peace was shattered .

In it , the Joker mysteriously returns to Gotham City decades after apparently dying in one final confrontation with Batman . But when future Batman Terry McGinnis investigates , he learns that " the Joker " is really Tim Drake , who was captured by the Clown Prince of Crime before his death , tortured , and implanted with a suggestion to taken over by the Jokers , for lack of a better term , spirit .

ComicBook.com put the images side by side and circled the mysterious areas of comparison . Can you see what they see ? <p> Not exactly a smoking gun is it ? In fact you could also say that from the evidence it looks like the Joker and Robin were harpooned together while they were hugging , While inferring that some mysterious shoulder marks is a sign that Robin at some point became the Joker makes for fun fan speculation , it seems more likely that someone is reading a bit too much into the situation . I remember a rumor about the- Star Wars- prequels back when they were in production that said a love triangle between Anakin , Padme and Obi-Wan was inevitable because why else would Padme be in the exact middle age-wise between Anakin and Obi-Wan ? That 's some unassailable logic right there , and ultimately not even close to what George Lucas was even thinking about in regards to those characters . <p> Clearly the use of the Robin imagery is purposeful , and clearly there 's some kind of connection to the Joker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. Superman- will address either directly or indirectly the " Death in the Family " storyline where the Joker beat Robin II Jason Todd with a crowbar and left him to die in an explosion .

See , there was once this time that the Sci-Fi channel , later rebranded SyFy in a much maligned and mocked marketing campaign , but the somewhat radical respelling of " sci-fi " came with a shift to do less compelling and original programming , and do more cheap reality shows and ridiculously over-the-top " original " movies like Sharknado , Dinocroc Vs Supergator , et al . In a surprising and interesting new interview , one SyFy exec is saying that the channel screwed the pooch when it comes to their programming the last few years , and at a time when genre TV has been booming on other network to boot . <p> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Bill McGoldrick , head of original programming at SyFy admits that in a world where Game of Thrones is on HBO , The Walking Deadis on AMC , and every major network now or soon will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel named after the genre needs to do a better job representing it . <p> " In terms of where it was before with original content and some of the series that were on the air , maybe they were more procedural , more lighthearted in tone " and by the way , those shows worked really well for a long time , " said McGoldrick discussing recent SyFy hits like Warehouse 13 andEureka . But more befitting a network named after science fiction , McGoldrick now has his eyes on space . " We have a couple really big shows that are trying to accomplish that " Ascension , The Expanse in particular , which play more toward I think the harder core sci-fi fan who used to be perceived as niche but is now mainstream and commercial in a way they have never been before .

So what we can only conclude was a drunken sugar binge decision by Paramount and MGM , a Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters sequel is on the way . <p> The decision for a sequel- may be due to the film reaching the $200 million dollar mark , but Deadline has confirmed that a number of the films producers expected a much bigger return , producers including Beau Flynn , comedian Will Ferrell , Adam McKay and Kevin Messick .

@@36130351 @5130351/ <p> Never being one that 's cosplayed myself , just a person that enjoys the medium , I could n't help but tune into SyFys Heroes of Cosplay a reality series that chronicles ( somewhat ) new and veteran costumers as they go from con to con in their latest garbs to be judged and take top position for fame and money . As with any reality series , some ( very obviously edited ) drama ensued . Some superficial BS , which has sent the cosplay community in a fritz . When I say fritz , I mean fans taking to Twitter and saying , " Well cosplay community , brace yourselves for the newsfeed attacks and peoples opinions . " Well , I guess , since I 'm writing this , I 'm guilty as charged . What I 'd like to do , though , is discuss the abhorrent editing from SyFy and how its depiction of cosplayers and misrepresented opinions is actually hurting the community . <p> MORE AFTER THE JUMP . <p> So , what 's all the fuss about ? Well , in last nights episode ( the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosplayer herself Yaya Han ( above ) was talking about the direction of one of the contestants costume choice . The contestant , who 's name I cant remember , went for a sexy burlesque version of Batman villain Poison Ivy ( see below ) . Now , keep in mind , this contestant is a close personal friend of Yaya Han and has received much tutelage from the veteran ; aka Robin to her Batman . Yaya has a personal view that craft and talent should take precedence over sexuality . The contestant apparently ignored Yaya in favor of modeling herself after another famed lady cosplayer by the name of Jessica Nigri ; who is known for displaying her body proudly in revealing ( that 's an understatement ) costumes . Which , I guess she did , because the girl trolloped on stage flaunting her goods and getting no praise for it . <p> Clearly , if you watched the show and read into what Yaya was trying to say rather that what was said ( or rather what was conveniently edited ) youd know she was expressing her stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally attacking Jessica Nigri or those like her for choosing to embrace the sexy side of cosplay . In fact , Yaya often has presented herself in promiscuous costumes and poses , so she 's no prude . Shes not a hypocrite either , just someone that tries to find the right balance . There 's no beef here between two authorities on cosplay . No matter how much SyFy takes comments out of context and intercuts shots of an opposing cosplayer , things are not going escalate to some fight in high heels . <p> Beside churning up some crap catty-ness between two different minded cosplayers , the show went on to make Yaya sound like more of an elitist when a discussion amongst the contestants came up on whether or not unfit people should be wearing costumes that do n't  flatter their body type or the character they 're portraying . Yaya ( and others ) said pro cosplaying is a serious thing and not everyone can be subject to scrutiny . Implying that heavy set people should fill costumes that match their body type ; in other words a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Yayas view on cosplay ( there 's a great write up on her Facebook Page HERE ) , couldnt be more far from the truth . Shes been very vocal in her support for all cosplaying body types . In fact , here 's a direct quote from her on the subject : <p> This is a hobby . An art form . A career for some . A social pastime for others . Cosplay is not a sport . There is no rule book , commandments , or memo on HOW you should cosplay . If you want to dress as a character that looks nothing like you , go for it ! There is so much judgement on race , gender , weight , size , height and other things that CAN NOT BE CHANGED in cosplay it has never made sense to me . Just like anyone should be able to collect an action figure of their favorite character , or wear a T-shirt of their favorite superhero , anyone should be able to show their love for a character by cosplaying them . People get so wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character should look like that they forget that they are talking about REAL HUMAN BEINGS . With feelings . <p> I wont argue that ignorant comments were said , but not by Yaya . Editing made it seem she did , or at least agreed , with another cast members dumb remark . How horribly misleading and damaging it is to present a legend that way . It just goes to show you how a genuine person with such a supportive mindset can be easily manipulated to capture eye-widening television . <p> Based on what I saw transpire on the show versus how I see cosplayers act in real life ( and online ) , coupled with the negative reactions abound on Twitter , SyFys edit team is sooooo obviously manufacturing drama and its total crap ! Its a gross misrepresentation of what cosplay is all about . Which , if you 're not clear on this , is about dedicated fanboys/girls who spend time and money to craft costumes of their pop culture idols . Yes , there is a pro level to cosplay in which fame and money are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some egotism ) . For the most part , though , its the simple joy of expressing oneself through costume . There is true talent , creativity , hard-work and comradery amongst those who choose to partake in this venture . A dramatized show like Heroes of Cosplay tarnishes all of that in favor of digging for melodrama . It really takes all the fun out of it . Completely discouraging to those who currently cosplay or are thinking about doing it for the first time . I mean , honestly , whod want to be associated with such egos and assholes , right ? I 'm all for nerdism hitting the mainstream and all , but not like this . It does more harm that it does good . <p> In the end , this is a TV show . I would expect nothing less than for there to be some level of amped up crisis , tension and people being douchecanoes ( ignorant to think otherwise ) . I just wish it was n't so goddamn blatant . Especially on the subject of cosplay , which is a self creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , something of value . If there has to be a show about cosplay , put more of a focus on the magic of costume making , what goes into it and the personalities/story of the person behind it . Something SyFys Face Off does very well . Watching passionate people make something from nothing and owning it that 's true entertainment . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

They 've worked on this for too long . You 've got to give them a chance to set it up somewhere else as two films . " Harvey gave us four weeks to do that , and then he was going to take it back and it would be the end of us . <p> That began a studio hunt for Jackson in hopes of saving his then two picture Lord Of The Rings deal .

And we put this whole pretense on that this project was so eagerly sought after laughs , which is complete crap . And we went into New Lines office at the end of that week , and the credit really ultimately belongs to Bob Shaye who was the head of New Line at that stage . He looked at the reel and said , You know what I do n't  get is why you want to do two films. And we thought , Oh , here we go . He s going to try to make us do one film now . The same story.

There were stutters about a Hulk feature and a Black Widow flick was completely shot down . Marvel bigwig Kevin Feige and friends were very up front with us , and surprisingly listened to our feedback . My favorite part was the declaration of a Black Panther film . This guy has always been one of my top heroes , and I could n't be happier hearing that 42 and Get On Up star Chad Boseman was nabbed for the role . I called it awhile back , actually . Which is a further testament to my unmatched manliness and vast intelligence . But enough facts about me let 's talk Black Panther , shall we ? <p> Mr. Boseman has a huge job ahead of him thanks to that 5-picture deal he inked with Marvel . The Black Panther is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , but all but lost to mainstream audiences . While Captain America , Spiderman and Superman have been household names for generations , the Panther has been quietly awesome since his inception during the Silver Age of comics . Mustachioed crusader Stan Lee and legendary penciler Jack Kirby created him back in 1966 . His first appearance was Fantastic Four #52 and he has the distinction of being the first black superhero in comics . The Black Panther paved- that rocky road for the likes of Luke Cage , Misty Knight , War Machine , John Stewart Green Lantern , among a few others . Sadly , black and other minority heroes werent shelled out with the jackhammer frequency of their white counterparts . But what there is should be treasured and nurtured . And that 's why its special for this hero to be seen on film . <p> The Black Panther character is also known as king TChalla of the fictional African nation of Wakanda . Wakanda is famous for being the only place on Earth where the nigh indestructible metal vibranium is mined . It comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was covetously protected by Black Panthers ever since . Vibranium has even been addressed several times in Marvel films , as its what Captain Americas shield is made of . Despite his royal stature , the precious metal cultivation also makes TChalla phenomenally rich . The Black Panther title is an inherited one bestowed unto the descendant who proves himself/herself worthy . <p> Before him , his father TChaka held the alter ego of Black Panther . When TChaka was unceremoniously killed by the scientist Ulysses Klaw , TChalla had to step up to the plate and assume the kingship and heroic namesake . If rumors and speculation mean anything , there 's a good chance that well see Klaw on the big screen also . It makes perfect sense to me , as the guy is basically Panthers arch enemy . That 's how things go down when a dude kills your dad . <p> His rites of passage that earned him the moniker and abilities of BP included a walkabout and defeating various tribes . Fully outfitted as his lands defender , he made friends with fellow superheroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further prove his worth , TChalla took to kicking the shit out of the Fantastic Four . He invited them to his home , like a pal would , and then proceeded to waste the entire team . Total dick move , yes . But he felt it a necessary evil , testing their mettle as future allies . He is a man who is fiercely dedicated to protecting his realm and figured he needed as many super-powered comrades as possible in case he needed backup . With a rogues gallery that includes Klaw , Man-Ape and White Wolf , I call that a good idea . I would n't beat them up first like he did the FF , but yeah <p> If you 're not yet sold on the Black Panther , there 's more . He s got a genius-level intellect and sweet detective skills , making him the African Batman . He s got a PHD in Physics from Oxford University and is considered one of the 8 smartest people on the planet . Being the Black Panther has awarded TChalla awesome mystical powers .

The guy is a rigorously trained gymnast and master of various martial arts . In the immortal words of Mel Brooks , " Its good to be the king . " <p> Playing the Panther is a top honor for any black actor and there were lots of dream castings going around the net for a long time . Not only was BP the first black comic book superhero , he s the coolest too . That 's why its special to me to see him onscreen . Black superheroes are grossly under-represented in comic books and movies . When Lee and Kirby created BP , I wish theyd kept that ball rolling , and not doing so has really hurt the genre . I 'm from the old school and I take my heroes very seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . While I 'm as Liberal as the next bleeding heart tree hugger , it makes me wince to think about a black Human Torch . Michael C. Duncan- as The Kingpin . Freakin Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White . And as awesome as Idris Elba is as Heimdel , there was no such thing as a black Norse god . That just insults my intelligence . And its equally annoying to see white actors play minority characters . A white Silver Fox ? A white Jubilee ? ? <p> The problem is clear as day : the low number of minority superheroes forces filmmakers to make weird decisions like that in order to appeal to broader audiences . Want your flick to make more dough ? Add minority characters that will attract minority money . It was certainly cool for me to see Falcon show up in Winter Soldier. Im giddy about War Machine being in Avengers 2. Thank goodness for Blade.Im dying to see who theyll cast as Luke Cage ( I 'm gunning for Chad Coleman . ) <p> Lots of people will say things like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " and ask " why is this important ? " Its important because I want everyone to matter equally . Everybody should want that and its past time we fixed some broken things . It stands to reason that these issues are less important when you do n't  have to deal with them . Its easy to shrug those things off when you 're a little kid and all the heroes look like you . You probably feel like you can aspire to great things and become larger than life . If you 're obviously not a mutant by puberty and there 's a shortage of radioactive spiders , at least you know there 's still time to train to become Batman . Remember when Northstar came out as being gay ? Homosexuals had a reason to cheer . The announcement of Captain Marvel getting her own movie is a reason for women and feminists to cheer .

Blomkamp ratchets up the CGI effects as well , melding his ambition with an economical and grounded approach to effects sequences and overall spectacle . <p> The result is a lived in and real universe that never pulls the audience out of the story , and as was the case with the $30 million dollar- District 9 , Elysium feels as if it cost twice as much as it did , even though it cost more than $100 million . <p> The way that Blomkamp constructs and portrays an action scene has a lot to do with that , and here , were seeing hand-held camera work , artfully applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight scenes . <p> Visual wow is useless without story , though , and that is the real star of this film : Blomkamps very smart and very original script . <p> Themes of nuclear class warfare , extreme immigration , and the rationing of healthcare strike a nerve because those themes echo fears about our present course . <p> Is Elysium prophetic ? Probably not , because ( as has been said before ) were naturally inclined to burden our view of the future with the weight of the present , but it could happen or the future could be even worse . <p> Despite that , though , Elysium should make us- think about the state of things , the walls that we already have up and the growing ease with which we display human- viciousness- and indifference ; and for a film to entertain and inspire debate and introspection like that well , that is a rare treat. - 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

There 's more to what she actually said , of course , but it was enough to get the internet up in arms . Some say the combative relationship of " Romione " ( yeahthey went there = ) means they could never have a successful romanceand Hermione would be better off with someone like Harry .

Frys advances are rebuffed , and his affections unreturned all throughout the first 4 seasons . At first its pretty understandable : Frys a lackadaisical - idiot with nothing to offer save for good intentionsand Leela ( for a one-eyed cartoon mutant ) is a total babe , way out of a loser like Frys league . <p> Over time we come to learn that Frywhile unintelligent , immature , and lazyis honorable , fiercely loyal , and utterly devoted to the people he loves . At the same time , the beautiful , intelligent , well-adjusted Leela is revealed as a seething ball of neuroses : She was an orphan who grew up believing she was an alien , only to learn as an adult that she 's really a sewer mutantshe got to know her parents , but had to hide the truth of her origins or get deported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meddling , nosy , and her impossible dating standards meant she was perennially alone.it takes four seasons before she really begins to consider Fry as a romantic prospect .

The series ended ( for good this time ) with Fry proposing to Leelaand I 'm hoping another made for dvd movie will be made to cover their wedding . <p> 4 . Gomez and Morticia Addams- ( The Addams Family ) <p> Has there ever been a couple more passionate , more romantic , creepier , kookier , mysteriouser , or spookier than Gomez and Morticia ? <p> Portrayed on the original 1964 tv series by John Astin and Carolyn Jones , and in the 1991 film version ( and its 1993 sequel ) by Raul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role models for geeks , weirdos , oddballs , goths and everyone else who just does n't  quite fit in for 50 years .

Kermit The Frog and Miss Piggy- ( Jim Hensons Muppets ) <p> Quite possibly the most famous non-human romance ( and definitely the most famous inter-species romance ) in modern pop culture is that of Kermit and Piggy .

Shes also jealous , possessive , and borderline physically abusive . <p> How or why they work ( in more ways than one ) is a total mystery , but their love is unmistakable and timeless . <p> 2 . Superman and Lois Lane- ( DC Comics ) <p> Easily the greatest comic book romance of all time , most modern iterations of Supermans story ( the tv series Smallville and the film Man of Steel , for example ) realize that Lois would have figured out who Clark Kent isI mean , she IS a Pulitzer prize winning investigative journalist : It stands to reason that eventually shed notice that the man she loves is the guy she works with sans glasses . <p> The pair have been married in more than one version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't Superman without Lois Lane , she " grounds " him.she reminds him what he s fighting for , and why the life he chose is worth everything he s had to give up .

Another instance was the sprite art of Registeel for Pokemon Diamond/Pearl , in which it looks like he is doing the hand salute . The European version of the game has changed to something " appropriate . " <p> Religion <p> POKEMON IS SATANIC ! If you like to listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot out there like him preaching how Pokemon , like Dungeons and Dragon , is all demonic. - Apparently- Pokemon introduce children to evolution , witchcraft , psychic powers from Satan , magic , and paranormal powers . There was also the whole listen to the PokeRap backwards during the " Got ta Catch em all " part and you can hear it clearly say " I love Satan . " There was even a Muslim communty who believed that this is all a plot to promote Jewish beliefs and that the word Pokemon means " I am Jewish . " <p> Burger King/Death <p> You heard that right . A promotion for Burger King had it where kids could get a Pokemon inside a PokeBall ( shown above ) with their kids meal. - Unfortunately , a young infant suffocated as one half of the PokeBall was stuck covering her nose and mouth . Burger King initially did not want to do a recall on the item since there was no real proof that the infant died because of the PokeBall . Some time later , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father . Once that happen , one of the most largest and expensive recalls happened . At least the kids were able to keep the Pokemon figures . <p> Jynx <p> A lady complained how Jynx looked after the initial episode that introduced the Psychic/Ice Pokemon . She compared how Jynx looks similair to Black Samba characters . This led to Jynxs later appearance to be edited out and also an entire episode to be skipped. - Nintendo later gave Jynx a more purple skin tone and also alter other parts of her appearance , in which , she was able to appear in later episodes with no problems . Most fans tries to defend the initial Jynx design by saying that it was influenced by the Japanese ganguro fashion style . <p> Electric Soldier Porygon/ Seizure <p> The Pokemon episode that got the Guinness World Record for " Most Seizures Caused by an Animated Television Program " title . How many seizures you asked , well , try 685 children having seizures . Although it did n't  lead to any deaths , it did cause a shake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All anime has the warning ( telling kids to not sit close to the TV and watch in a brightly lit room ) at the beginning now because of this episode . What happened , is that at a scene , when Pikachu does a Thunder shock/Thunderbolt to a- missile , that was shot a by a X-Wing/Needle hybrid looking jet , it led to a series of fast paced red to blue colors in the background . The color effects was on throughout the episode and it cause the Pokemon anime to go on a hiatus and a world-wide ban on the episode was made by the Japanese government . The episode is available on YouTube , view if you want to but VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK . <p> Well , there you have it folks , hope ya enjoy reading some of these controversies that this kid game franchise had to go through and here looking for more in the next 14 years . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Etan Cohen wrote a very funny screenplay about Nick and Tree and we used it as the template for the characters but we 've never met the dude . <p> You 're both denying that you came to this because you got confused and thought Etan Cohen was Ethan Coen , ala Bill Murray and his stated reason for joining Garfield , right ? - <p> Gagerman : Andrew did this for the same reason he does everything to get out from under the massive debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hey do you think they 're doing a Garfield 3 ?

This fan theory has been around for a long time . Even before The Walking Dead took to the television airwaves , back when it was just an unknown black and white comic book , I remember people discussing that this better not be a Coma dream in the end . Robert Kirkman finally decided to weigh in and settle the matter with a few tweets today . <p> Ok , so me and my sister have been thinking out this particular theory Rick is still in his coma and is dreaming everything . When he wakes up Lori , Carl , and Shane are sitting by his bedside waiting for him to wake up . Because he has been in the coma for so long , Carl is obviously older and Lori has the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the hospital bed next to him , suffering from a hit from her abusive husband . When Lori realizes Rick is waking up she runs to get the nurse and doctor . First the nurse ( who is Maggie ) runs in to take his vitals , following her is the doctor ( Who is Hershel ) . Rick does n't  realize what is going on and asks " Maggie " where is everyone else ? Where then Maggie would respond " How do you know my name , you 've been in a Coma for over a year . " <p> As Rick is being released from the hospital , he walks past several patients and people sitting in the waiting room . Those people would include some of the favorite cast members : Michonne , Andrea and Amy , t-dog , Dale etc <p> While stopped at a stop light driving home , that 's when you hear the motorcycle , and Daryl pulls up beside the grimes car . Rick looks over at his " friend " wanting him to recognize him so badly . Daryl does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be included somehow as well like the governor , and Garreth and everyone shown in season 5 &amp; 6 . <p> Me and my sister were so sad theorizing this scenario . Any comments or thoughts ? <p> Just imagine how the Internet would explode if that happened . Finding Bobby Ewing in the shower on Dallas would pale in comparison to the ensuing outrage . Well , you do n't  have to worry about it any longer . Creator Robert Kirkman has decided to weigh in on this popular fan theory in response to an Uproxx posting by tweeting this earlier today : <p> Going on record to answer this : http : //t.co/3lhUI6A3bW Rick is NOT still in a coma . The events of TWD are definitely happening . <p> Now everyone can take a deep breath , because the man himself says it ai n't  so .

He s been crazy since he killed his first zombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 2014 <p> Kirkman is a funny guy who likes pouring fictional gas on the Internet fire . Somewhere , someone is taking what he said seriously . I know how impossible that sounds , but remember .

In issue #8 Kirkmans Letter Hacks , the letters pages in The Walking Dead comic book , Kirkman first responded to the cause of the outbreak and basically said that : <p> Going back to explain how the government originally collapsed , " does n't  interest me , for the time beingI may change my mind eventually .

@@36130378 @5130378/ <p> Almost since its inception there 's been nothing but drama and controversy surrounding SyFys reality program , Heroes of Cosplay . Initially the choice of content combined with a predominately female cast raised concern the series was only interested in parading around sexy girls in costume . Thankfully , the series has managed to steer clear of that , though sexuality and how much is proper for cosplay did become a hot-button issue . An issue that was only escalated by some heavily manufactured drama between Yaya Han and Jessica Nigiri ; - a matter we 've covered before . <p> Now it seems only a handful of episodes , and a new- editor/supervising director , later there 's only more drama and fan backlash for the series . To the point where I 'm questioning what SyFys intention for the program was if all it has caused is dissent in the community it chose to portray ? <p> After watching the first two episodes of Heroes of Cosplay , I stopped . Not because I did n't  like those participating in the show , but because I was n't interested in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stress and , at times , animosity which occurs in such a competitive cosplay field . I wanted to watch phenomenal costumers create amazing costumes , but so little of the show actually focuses on the time , effort , and craftsmanship the contestants put into each of their works . I was expecting Face-Off , and I get Americas Next Top Model . <p> And perhaps , that 's really all I should have expected . Its a reality show , right ? And being so it has certain criteria that must be met , the most important of which is : DRAMA . And Heroes of Cosplay appears to go at any length to get it , including bringing their show with its many established and professional cosplayers to Kansas Citys Planet ComicCons obviously amateur costume contest . <p> As I admitted earlier , I do n't  watch the show , so I learned of this whole ordeal when a blog post written by Amy Schley ( who along with her friends organized one fantastic looking femme-Doctor group featuring all 11 Doctors ) describing her experience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my attention . I read it and was heartbroken to hear of someones hometown convention being overtaken by SyFy - or perhaps more accurately I should be saying 51 Minds , the production studio behind Heroes of Cosplay , though SyFy clearly agreed to air it . You can read her entire summary of events over on her blog , but here 's some points I want to draw attention to , <p> We arrived at the convention and went to sign up for the masquerade , only to discover that not only were we required to agree to be on the show , but also that we had to do a skit. - In speaking to other entrants , we realized that no one had been aware of this requirement , and that in fact the skit requirement had been added only a day before the competition . - We , like our fellow competitors , frantically threw a skit together . <p> The actual masquerade was an exercise in humiliation and frustration . - We went first , which allowed us to see how miserably outclassed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gigantic props , soundtracks with prerecorded dialog , light cues , grips , and smoke effects . - One group had cosplayers who owned their own production company and had done a gig for Guillermo del Toro ; the other had Yaya Han herself , who boldly came out of " retirement " from competing at cons to compete at a con with no professional/ amateur split . - The only local group that was able to put together a decent performance was a group of fairies who also dance at the local Renaissance Festival . <p> Right off the bat they 've created a situation where , inherently , someone would become peeved to see those attending the convention because they love whatever it is they love , made a costume of it , and chose to compete at their local con be " outclassed " by such famous talent as Yaya Han and Holly Conrad and- Jessica Merizan of Crabcat Industries . I want to be clear I 'm not knocking those on the show , the " Heroes " if you will . Its evident they are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they love it . What I 'm criticizing is the shows decision to bring them into a competition which is so obviously not a major cosplaying competition like the one featured earlier at- Anime Matsuri in Houston , TX . <p> Schley writes , " Planet Comicon gave out approximately $300 in 2012. - The show subsidized the approximately $5000 handed out as prizes at Planet Comicon in 2013 . " Yaya herself often refers to her coslay as a professional gig , its how she earns her living . At the pre-judging for the group costume contest she was clearly miffed the judges would n't check the seams on her stunningly beautiful Queen of Hearts cosplay to ensure the quality of the craftsmanship . Well , of course they are n't  going to look at your seams , Yaya , this simply is n't as intense or serious of a cosplay competition as you 're used to ! <p> From there , things unfortunately took a turn for the worst . As tempers grew heated , remarks were made between the group of Who cosplayers and Holly , Jessica , and Becky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good light . Schley admits in her post to losing her temper and saying comments she regrets . She also talks about how those running the show Heroes I mean , not the cosplay competition wanted to push the drama sparked between them and even offered to hold interviews in their confessional room in order to get their side of the story . Wisely , they declined , but even in their refusal to continue arguing a shot of Schleys sister dressed as the Third Doctor holding up her hand and saying , " Were done , here , " was edited and inserted in such a way to appear very aggressive . Reading Schleys account of the events her sister was simply doing her best to stay non-responsive and calm during the confrontation , but its already apparent what a bit of tricky editing can achieve . <p> Now , I also want to make it clear I do n't  want everyone believing the group of Who cosplayers were victimized and the " Heroes " were the arch villains of this piece . Again , the villains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decisions of where they go , what they film , etc . I 'm not defending their name-calling of Holly , Jessica , and Becky because that was rude . Chloe Dykstra , who did n't  compete in the group contest but won for her awesome cosplay of Gaige from Bordelands 2 in the solo competition , wrote her own response to Schleys post . Shes pretty terse , but makes good points , <p> Syfy did n't tell the Doctor Who girls they needed to cause drama . It happened all by itself because of three things : <p> People do n't like things like TV shows invading their small community ( understandable ) . <p> People do n't like when the odds are stacked against them in a way that feels unfair ( though the cast entirely made their own costumes and paid for almost everything ) . Either way , they won something . <p> Cosplayers tend to tear down their own kind when they feel threatened . All people do . Especially the cosplay community , though , as I 've noticed A LOT on Tumblr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ladies trying to blame their BS on the show : You ca n't edit something in that was n't said , and the show portrayed you just as you were . <p> Very true , they could n't create the comments said , but they sure could choppily splice it all together to make the scene look all the more uncomfortable . And yes , the Doctor Who group took home $500 and the award for Best Craftsmanship which is awesome and proves at least the judges were taking into consideration the unusual circumstances of this competition . In the end , Yaya , - Riki Lecotey , and Monika Lee won Best in Show for their kick-ass- American McGees Alice group because it was , simply put , AMAZING . But again , these are top notch cosplayers who arrived with a practiced skit , pre-recorded audio , impressive costumes , - etc. , so of course they were going to wipe the floor with anyone else who entered . <p> To add a nice ending to this whole debacle , after scanning the comments on Schleys original post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two agree tempers were flying high that night and both acknowledge there are no hard feelings after the fact . And that 's quite heartening , and only further proves my point that these women , both of the show and of Kansas City , were manipulated into being the heroes or villains of bad situation that need not have occurred in the first place . <p> Shame on you 51 Minds and SyFy for fabricating needless drama and attempting to cause a rift in the cosplay community all in the pursuit of ratings . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

For capable Mages , spells can be woven into a symphony of destruction . <p> But a spell book packed full of goodies in a dungeon haul and you will have you Mages collecting all the books they can find to transfer spells over . While Spells are irrefutably cool and totally Kick-Ass there are definitely some magic that is Hmmhow do I find the eloquent wordsBall chuggingly useless that they make me want to set myself on fire .. Ok , Ok so I 'm kind of a drama queen . So here is a list of the Lamest D&amp;D spells ( Priest and Mage ) . <p> 10 ) Fairie Fire- Outlines your target , humanoid or inanimate object with a glowing red line . It also gives you the benefit of outlining INVISIBLE people , robbing you or attempting to do you harm . Now if you 're dealing with an invisible opponent and you 're using this spell as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league . It may be more practical to throw a sack of flour at himThat may be more affective . <p> 9 ) **26;457;TOOLONG These low level spells- are both individual spells . Clairvoyance let 's you select a specific area and see what is going on without actually being thereAnd Clairaudience let 's you hearSee my problem ? If you do n't  use BOTH , its kinda useless . Oh , and I liked the spell better the second time I used itWhen it was called scrying . ( David Spade , SNL reference ) <p> 7 ) Ottos Irresistible Dance- Domination , Suggestion , Charm , nearly all these spells can get a person to dance unwillingly ! Plus , this spell is super lame because its 8th LEVEL ! ! That means you need to be at least like 15th Level to cast it . And while it renders an opponent prone ( I guess ) , all it really is doing ? Is pissing them off . I 'm sure at 8th level you have better tricks up your sleeve And Otto ? The Mage who created this spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was giggling with his buddies after too much pipe weed , and chowing on MLTs ( mutton , lettuce and tomatoes ) , while making innocent bystanders uncontrollably dance in the market around the marketplace ! <p> 6 ) Shillelagh-Turns a stick into a club with a +1 , which is basically a stick with a +1 . I think a real Shillelagh would do more damage than a stick . Most affective when used by leprechauns , who can combine it with their weird powers . In the hands of a Priest ? Its a stick . <p> 5 ) Starshine- In a dungeon when your looking for light , what do you do ? Video games OR D&amp;D ? Spark up a torch . Low level mages can cast the spell Light , 2nd level mages can cast Continual Light which is a Permanent , super bright enchantment placed on anything you want . Warriors ? Whip out their magic swords which radiate a glow that illuminates as bright as candlelight .. So Starshine . What does it do ? It ( also a high level spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft twinkling lights to guide you wayPerfect cover for a dozen goblins to flank you , and for use outside ? Almost as good as regular star light . <p> 4 ) Detect Undead- Ah yes , if the undead in the 60 ' radius are that close and you do n't  know it ? You are about to die . And if you are using this spell ? You are too low a level to take on the hoard . " Run Bitch ! ! Ruuuuuuuun ! ! ! ! ! ! " <p> 3 ) Affect Normal Fires Wow , what a party trick ! ! ! Take a torch or regular campfire and have it shrink down to embers ! ! Or Have it Roar into a bonfire ! That 's about it . I have been playing D&amp;D fo 19 years and have yet to find a suitable use for this spell . Spying on a group of a dozen Orcs , while they are roasting their human femur on the fire spit you blast it up and.Burn their dinner .. <p> 2 ) Magic Stone- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly.1D4 damage projectilesOR take a BIG rock and shot-put , itll do more damage . Or use a DAGGER ! ! <p> 1 ) Haste- Now , his is all accurate info Im about to spew at you . Haste doubles your speed and let 's you attack twice instead of once per round . See , I thought Haste , at the level its at , would make you speed up to at least 4 or 5 times the speed you move . Also a drawback , unless you 're an Elf is that it ages you one year each time you cast it . So to cast the spell and move at double time for a short amount of time and aging yourself 1 year for 6-10 minutes , you are aging 75,000 times as fast as normal . Is that worth it ? A few minutes of double speed ? No. no it is n't . <p> Secret Track 0 ) Wish- The spell of spells . The rarest , the raddest , the baddest . Problem is , you need to be SO precise while using this spell because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have someone cast it with a lot of lore and who is very wise in that area . Wish is a double sided sword . It takes top accolades as Lame because it should be a fun and beautiful thing to use . You should not fear the WishAlso it ages you 10 yearsAnd you thought Haste was bad ! ? 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

@@36130382 @5130382/ <p> One of the biggest questions left unanswered in J.J. Abrams Star Wars : The Force Awakens is the question of who Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) is and how does she fit into the Star Wars universe ? We found out what she is , a highly force sensitive quick learner and plucky scavenger that can fight , shoot , and wield a lightsabar when pressured to do so . What we did n't  find out is just exactly where she came from , who are her parents , and why she was left by herself on Jakku of all places . It seems everyone has a theory or two and this NerdBastard is no different . Let 's explore one possibility that feels right . <p> We should start with Reys Force Vision . Just like Lukes Force Vision on Dagobah , while Luke had a vision of the future as a Dark Lord like Darth Vader , Rey has visions of her future and her past . It starts when she touches the lightsaber used by Anakin and Luke . <p> Now a lot of people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While that idea is compelling , I ca n't help but think that Leia , Han and others that know Luke , including Kylo Ren would recognize her if that was the case . Especially Kylo Ren , he was after all , digging around in her head for information . <p> Kylo and the Knights of Ren murdering some people , or really just stepping over people they just killed ) . <p> Rey being dropped off on Jakku as a young child . <p> Kylo coming at Rey in the snowy forest from the end of the movie . <p> First off , if the vision seemed intense , vague , misleading , confusing , or sudden , that was the point . The scenes shown were all filmed , some probably got cut and only portions put into the vision . We might get more of those scenes as the new trilogy progresses . It was designed to raise more questions then it answered . <p> One big question about the vision is this : Are those visions placed in a direct time line order , meaning did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but do n't  let the fact that the first and last seem placed correctly keep you from examining the other visions time placement , but let 's take this as the order in which these events happened . <p> That means that the scene with Luke is not at his Jedi academy , but somewhere else . Something bad has happened , we can tell that by the burning ash and the posture of Luke , he reaches to R2-D2 for emotional support as the droid is one of his best friends . A lot of people have taken this moment of Luke reaching out to R2-D2 as the moment he shut R2-D2 down , but I do n't  think that is the case . <p> Luke at that time would have most likely be out searching for other Force sensitive people to train , that was his driving force . Gather those with the Force and help them become Jedi , to rebuild the Jedi Order . Now were going to speculate a bit , but bear with us . Luke senses a disturbance in the Force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force in others , so perhaps he s gotten better at it and does n't  need a whole planet to die to hear a disturbance in the Force . <p> He searches for the disturbance , or the Force sensitive person he senses , and when he gets there he finds the place destroyed . Perhaps the Knights of Ren went there first , or some other agent of Supreme Leader Snoke . Did Luke already know the person or persons killed ? That would explain his posture , you could just tell he was saddened by what he saw there was some feeling of attachment there . Perhaps he was returning to that person to try to convince them to join him in training other Jedi or help him with his problem student Kylo . <p> Could this have been another older Jedi that survived the purges ? Perhaps a Jedi like Ezra Bridger from Star Wars Rebels is destined to become . here 's the real speculative bit . <p> Those two are definitely moving towards a romantic relationship in Star Wars Rebels . Let 's say the do end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely inherent Ezras Force abilities . The pair could n't continue to fight the Empire with a child on the way , and by that time they would have been fighting for a long time . Perhaps they thought they had done enough and deserved the life and safety of a simple family . Remember Ezra had that farm childhood and would probably want that for his child was well . <p> After Return of the Jedi , when Luke starts looking to Force sensitive people to start his Jedi Academy , he probably ran across Ezra at some point . Perhaps hell meet them before that , after all Princess Leia meets Erza in Star Wars Rebels episode A Princess on Lothal . <p> That means that Leia knew both Ezra and Jedi Kanan before she met Luke . She could tell Luke of them when Luke is looking to find Jedi that survived the purge . <p> So if we take all that and add it to the scene of Luke and R2-D2 , did Luke arrive in time to save the child or did Ezra sacrifice himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights of Ren . Even better , perhaps Ezra stayed to fight the Knights of Ren while Saben escaped with Rey in the Ghost . <p> here 's a look at the rear of the Ghost : <p> The Ghost from behind does look like the ship in Reys Force vision . One telling point , that it is not a memory , Rey sees herself as a child in the vision . Unkar Plutt ( Simon Pegg ) , the junk dealer on Jakku is holding her hand . Think about your own memories , do they include you in the picture ? <p> Could Sabine and or Erza have taken Rey to Jakku to stash her while they went back to help Luke with the Knights of Ren ? The story speculation this NerdBastard likes is that Erza dies fighting off the Knights of Ren while Sabine escapes with Rey to Jakku . Luke arrives to find the home destroyed , thinking Sabine and the child are dead as well . Sabine meanwhile knows Unkar from some past dealings and trusts him enough to stash Rey there while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and Sabine does n't  make it back , leaving Rey stranded on Jakku . <p> This would tie together the animated series with the feature films . Weve seen characters from the movies brought into the animated series , Lando , Darth Vader , Princess Leia , and others , its time for one or more of those Animated characters to make the move to the live action big screen . The voice actors for Erza and Sabine would be perfect to make that translation , a little makeup and they could easily pass for the older versions of the characters they voiced on the animated series . <p> Although they would have to be just flashbacks in the scenario we 've set forth for Rey . The powers that be could still use Jedi Kanan ( Freddie Prince Jr. ) or Hera Syndulla ( Vanessa Marshall ) , or the droid C1-10P- Chopper . <p> What do you think ? Does this make better sense then Luke being her father , or that she is some Force reincarnation of Anakin , or the descendant of Emperor Palpatine ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Could Rey be the granddaughter of Obi-Wan ? Of course wed have to have some way that Obi-Wan finds a lover and a child while keeping tabs on Luke on Tatooine . Perhaps the Obi-Wan movie or movies ( cross your fingers ) will address that . <p> Let us know who you think Reys parents are in the comments section below . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804 
@@36130383 @5130383/ <p> The Walking Deadhas been an emotional rollercoaster so far this season . It opened with a mighty bang with the deaths of major characters . But then something strange happened . The show absolutely deflated after the season premiere , to the point where the show started losing an alarming number of viewers . The show blandly followed the journey of all the separated main survivors and struggled with pacing and entertainment value . For the most part , Jeffrey Dean Morgans turn as Negan has been the highlight of the show , but even that has become stale and routine . But then the mid season finale rolls along and renews much of our faith in the show . <p> As always , spoilers for The Walking Dead . <p> So , by all indications , it looked as if we were going to get- another 90 minutes- of the same boring milquetoast that we have come to expect from this season of The Walking Dead . The first several minutes of the show played out like an extended cut of the " Last Time On The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negan is still making himself at home in Ricks house . Rick and Aaron are still trying to get the supplies out from zombie lake . Maggie is still the worst patient ever . <p> It needs to be mentioned that the interaction between Maggie and Gregory at Hilltop was very telling . It felt as if we were watching two prize fighters weighing in before the main event . Gregory attempted to establish a small amount of dominance over Maggie by denying her the apple , yet that completely backfired as a nearby Hilltop resident called Gregory out for not giving food to the hungry pregnant woman . It was a fine bit of foreshadowing that showed that even on a small scale , the residents of Hilltop would choose Maggie to lead them over Gregory . No doubt there will be some sort of power struggle in a future episode between Maggie and Gregory . <p> Let 's face it , did anyone really like Spencer ? The character was very one dimensional in his dislike of Rick . As soon as the one Negan minion started coming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen next . Good Ol Spence was going to try and talk to Negan and get close to manipulate the situation for his benefit . One couldnt help but make comparisons to Ellis in the classic film Die Hard . For those unenlightened few who have not seen Die Hard , Ellis is a character who tries to cut a deal with ruthless terrorists by making them a proposal . Sound familiar ? The only thing that was missing was a Coke and Spencer saying , " Negan ! Bubby ! " In the end , Spencer was gutted by Negan in a pretty gruesome show of force that reminded us of just how lethal Negan is . Which is actually nice , since no one can remember Negan killing anybody since Glenn and Abraham . It helps to actually put some tension back into the show knowing that Negan can and has killed major characters . <p> It was good to see Carol again after being away from the character for a few weeks . Its a shame that she is still in a " Leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fairly difficult to remember how she got into that frame of mind in the first place . Its as if the fight with Morgan in the Alexandria basement over what to do with the Wolf , has shaken her to the core . With any luck , we will get the old Carol back before things come to a head with Negan . She is definitely a force multiplier in combat . It was also nice seeing the interaction between Morgan and Carol . The fact that Carol asked Morgan to come in , should be a clear example of her starting to miss people . The Kingdom guard who also shows up is able to provide a small morsel of information about the status of the world . He said that there used to be many groups and communities that had sprouted up , however , most of them are gone now . The guard seemed to have a big stake in getting Carol and Morgan to convince Ezekiel to make a pre-emptive strike on the Saviors . And what was up with the secret RV stash the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that it was shown as a possible stash of supplies that could be made available to the survivors . <p> Darryls great escape fell somewhat flat . We still do n't  know who left his cell unlocked , or who left the note telling him to " Go Now " . Good money says it was either Dwight or Dwights ex-wife , but we do n't  know for sure . Whomever it was , opens the door for there to be an ally within the walls of Sanctuary . That could be a game changer in the upcoming conflict seeing that the Saviors outnumber Alexandria and the Hilltop combined . Watching Darryl escape was okay , but not earth shatteringly awesome as we all have come to expect from some Darryl action . Remember , the man put a grenade down the barrel of a tank . The scene where he was caught by Fat Joe seemed somewhat pointless . Best guess is that the scene was used to show the audience that Negan had not broken Darryl . Although to be fair , the audience already knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely surprising for the fact that Gabriel actually gave good and sound advice . He talked about how it was n't her fault that Glenn or Abraham died and that there was no guarantee that she would kill Negan . Gabriel told her that they needed to wait and take Negan on together . This was by far , the smartest thing that has ever come out of Gabriels mouth during his time on the show . <p> So to quickly summarize , after Negan kills Spencer , Rosita tries to shoot him with the bullet that Eugene made for her . Miraculously , the bucket hits Lucille instead . Also miraculously , Negan is able to tell that the bullet was made from scratch . Barbara gets killed and its discovered that Eugene made the bullet . So Negan takes Eugene . Rick and Michonne have a heart to heart talk and Rick decides that it is time to fight . <p> So come to find out that Maggie had been at the Hilltop lookout looking for the main group of survivors . At the end of he episode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right emotional notes . It symbolized that the group was going to work together and figure out a way to fight Negan . The reunion between Rick and Darryl was especially emotional . And then when Darryl gave Rick back his Python , it perfectly symbolized that the Old Rick has finally come home . <p> The only unanswered question about the episode is , who is the person with the weird boots that watched Rick and Aaron at the lake and viewed Alexandria from beyond the gate ? <p> Overall , the mid-season finale was great . Having the main group of survivors come together at the end , was a huge emotional payoff . This season has felt lost and aimless as it followed the individual adventures of the cast , yet the final scenes of the episode provided an emotional closure that no one knew they needed . It took far too long , but they got the band back together . And they are going to bring it . 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

@@36130403 @5130403/ <p> Last week , - Penny Dreadful- did n't  lean so hard on the weird , and did a more " day in the life " episode for our assorted - and tortured gothic characters ; " Predators Far and Near " seemed to be the antidote . The show sank a bit deeper back into the weirder side this week thanks to cannibalism , torture , and communicating through dreams with the mystical powers of wacky tobacky . What 's become , perhaps , a bit obvious is that with Dracula lurking in the shadows , and every other member of the old gang obsessed with their own stuff , Vanessa may be forced to deal with him alone , and that 's a troubling prospect since we 've learned this week that he s already got his claws into her. - <p> And of course , we do n't  mean Renfield . No , Dracula is none other than Dr. Alexander Sweet , the friendly and knowledgeable zoologist that has caught Vanessas interest . After another stressful round of therapy with Dr. Seward , Vanessa makes her way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Vanessa is , obviously , his best student . There 's such a palpable connection between the two , something very sweet and innocent , and those- are hard qualities to find when one of the parties has already been- the love interest of the Devil , so- you knew this was going to end horribly , right ? Of course , my first thought was that Sweet was going to be vampire chow , and not the vampire master . <p> Casting Sweet as Dracula was a fun surprise in the moment , but in hindsight it should have been more obvious . Sweet made such an impression on Vanessa , and knowing her luck he had to be a bad guy , right ? ! It also raises an interesting conundrum , like why Dracula needs Renfield to do after hours research on Vanessa when shes clearly smitten by the Sweet alias and his infectious optimism about all the creatures of the world . Wouldnt she give up insight about herself voluntarily with the more time they spend together ? And are we to understand that Draculas fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I seem to remember the Kid and Eraserhead following Vanessa around before that . <p> Adding insult to the injury of learning that Sweet is Dracula , was Vanessas continued recovery from her long depression . She seemed to put some effort into her appearance this week , for example , but of course Dr. Seward is n't having any of it , and recognizes Vanessas effort as merely an effort and not really a sign that she was coming out of her funk . Vanessa tells Seward her story her long , sad , dark story and one can only assume there may have been a cathartic feeling in it for Vanessa ; Dr. Seward meanwhile seems horrified by what she heard , but its tough to say whether it was a felling of " Wow , this girls been through some $# ! % " or " Wow , this girl is bat$# ! % nuts ! " Its a very fine line . <p> Speaking of nuts , Kaetenay and Sir Malcolm are now on the high seas , and travelling to America , off to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , *really* needs the help. - Kaetenay reaches out to Ethan through dreams and some kind of peyote , which admittedly gave me pause because its another stereotypically " Indian " thing , like last weeks scalping , that would not be out of place in an old John Wayne movie , or an episode of- The Lone Ranger . So much of- Penny Dreadful- is about subverting the tropes and the expectations of the times its set in , and- Kaetenay feels like writer John Logan is playing right into them in the case of Native Americans . <p> Despite that though , the relationship between Ethan and- Kaetenay seems fascinating . Its inferred that Ethan werewolfed out and killed some people that- Kaetenay knew , perhaps people in- Kaetenays family , but there 's another level , a subtext . Ethan is ticked that- Kaetenay would appear in his dreams , but- Kaetenay wants Ethan to understand that " You are an Apache . " Okay , so are we to understand when- Kaetenay calls Ethan a son , that perhaps he means it literally . That Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico territory , inferring that his curse may not be a curse , but an inheritance . And why is Hecate following Ethan ? I feel bad I did n't  recognize her last week , but she was n't naked and bald . <p> We finally- caught up with Lily and Dorian Gray who walked into some kind of torture chamber where rich Londoners watch a medieval executioner visits horrors on a young naked girl . You at once figure that Dorian is engaging Lily in some of his off-color proclivities , but nope , they were there to kill everyone and save the girl . I 'm not sure going after the Eli Roths of Victorian England was what I had in mind when Lily told Victor about world domination at the end of season two , but it does open intriguing doors . Do they aim to show the people of London that monsters are better behaved than the so-called normals ? That they only kill the guilty . <p> Certainly , Lily was better behaved when it came to Victor . They had a break-up talk that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiority that it was the last time they shared a scene , but no matter what wonders that Jekyll is showing Frankenstein in his lab , Victor is still moping like a sad bastard teenager getting over his first crush . Does Lily regret treating Victor so horribly ? I hardly think so because she 's very dismissive of him in the end telling him not to come back . That was n't as cold as the diss last season , but it was still pretty icy . <p> The Frankenstein/Jekyll team up is probably the weak link of the season so far , the one storyline that when he shift to it seems to slow the action down . Jekylls less than subtle references to his own battling duality are already tiresome ; its like every time a character on- Gotham- refers to their future identity . We get it ! We know were going to see a Mr Hyde at some point , but its still unclear how his experiments are going to " fix " Lily to Frankensteins ideal , and Victor himself , although interested by Jekylls science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it can even be accomplished . Maybe he still hopes shell come back on her own . <p> A theme is developing about this third season that perhaps ones feeling of monstrousness comes from something they feel inside them , and not necessarily reflected in their own actions . Can Lily and Dorian be monsters if they save a girl from being victimized ? Can Ethan be monstrous if there 's a community somewhere that wants him , and that he can fit in to ? Can Vanessa be monstrous if the wanderlust-filled Dr. Sweet enjoys her company ( even though she does n't  know he s really a monster ) ? Those are all good questions that play to the heart of the show , but its only a matter of time till Dracula/Sweet reveals his true intentions 176803 @qwx376803 176802 @qwx376802 176804 @qwx376804

Cox pointed out that Lee has been on the show in a way as a portrait of a police officer in the 15th precinct . " I- told him that and he did n't seem satisfied , " Henson deadpanned . <p> Cox showed off his fanboy-ness when he asked what the biggest surprise for him has been so far making the show. - " The one thing that made the hair on back of my neck stand up was at the end of episode seven or eight in season two when they describe the Hole , " he said . " I was waiting and hoping for that mystical element to become a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never-ending hole in the middle of Manhattan you think , Cool ! I hope that Hole is explored more in season three . " <p> Before geeking out over the Hole though , Cox was concerned about the blackness of playing blind . He admitted that he perhaps went a little too method . " I had blacked out contacts made for the first 2 episodes and it was great for me , but terrible for everyone else because for the first three days I was a terribly annoying person , " he said . " I worked with a wonderful man named John and he s been legally blind for 20 years , and we 'd go out in the City of New York blindfolded and it was literally a case of the blind leading the blind . So whenever I have a question about making a cup of tea , or playing pool like in season two , I think its really important to get that stuff right because he s one of the only superheroes that 's disabled , and it 's important to represent that struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles .

" <p> The duo were asked on a strictly hypothetical basis who from the expansive Marvel Cinematic Universe that they would like to have on Daredevil . " Based on Matts history , Black Widow Scarlett Johasson would be good , " Cox said to applause . " I 'm a big Chris Pratt fan , " Henson added .
