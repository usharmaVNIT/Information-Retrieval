We recommend that faux wood blinds over 72 " wide and wood blinds over 84 " wide be split into 2 or 3 blinds on one headrail depending on the configuration of the windows or ordered as separate blinds with a common valance . If you want to have a larger blind made as a single unit , you may be able to do so , but it would void the warranty . <h> How do I order a blind for a large opening that contains three windows , but the window sections are not the same width ? <p> A <p> Our sales agents are experts at doing these calculations , so do n't  hesitate to call 888-256-8672 , option 1 for sales to place your order over the phone . <p> To order a 3on1 headrail you will order the overall width ( smallest width measurement at the top , middle &amp; bottom or your window opening ) you need and specify in the order options under head rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sizes of the individual windows , as well as the location of the controls for each blind . For example , if the window opening is 92 " wide , you would order the blind at the overall width of 92 " . Then choose the 3on1 option and specify the indidividual blind width as : " Left blind 30 + " with tilt and lift controls on the left ; Center blind 31 " with tilt cord on the left and lift cord on the right ; Right blind 30 + " with tilt and lift controls on the right . " <p> To order 3 separate blinds as inside mount : Measure the overall width ( smallest width at the top , middle &amp; bottom of your window opening ) . If the windows are the same size , simply divide by 3 ( rounded to the nearest 1/8 " , making the center blind slightly wider if it does not divide evenly ) . Measure each individual window if the windows are not equal . Then use the 3 individual window widths to order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blinds . The normal factory deductions for inside mount will allow the blinds to fit perfectly and move freely in the window . Be sure to put notes in the comments section indicating that the 3 blinds are going into 1 window and that you need a common valance to fit the overall width at the top of the window ( measure the width at the top of the window opening to get this measurement ) . <p> To order 3 separate blinds as outside mount : Measure the overall area that you want to cover with all 3 blinds . Then divide the overall measurement into 3 separate sections ( be sure to position your gaps over the mullions in the window whenever possible ) for the individual blinds . You will need to allow 1/2 " gap between each blind for the brackets and to allow the blinds to move freely . Usually you would subtract 1/4 " from the width of the two outside blinds and 1/2 " from the width of the middle blind to adjust for these gaps . Order these blinds as outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section indicating that the 3 blinds are side by side and that you need a common valance to fit the overall width of the area you want to cover . The valance you will received will be at least 1 1/2 " wider the the overall width to allow room to cover the sides of the brackets . Be sure you have enough room at the top to accomodate the additional width . <h> What is the " routeless/privacy " option ? <p> A <p> A routeless blind does not have holes punched in the slats for the ladder cords to run through , instead the slats have small notches on the back of the slat to hold the ladder cords in place . This option provides additional light control and privacy . <h> Is there a minimum depth requirement for an inside mount ? <p> A <p> Yes , you will need a certain amount of depth in order to install a blind or shade within the recessed area of your window opening . This amount varies by product ( usually 3/4 " to 2 " ) and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webpage for each product . Remember that is you only have the minimum depth then some of the blind or shade will extend outside the window . All of our products list the minimum depth required and the flush mount depth required on the product specification page . <h> What is the top down/bottom up option offered on some of your shades ? <p> A <p> The top down/bottom up option allows you also lower your shade from the top or lift from the bottom , so that you can cover only portions of the window with the shade fabric and still enjoy the view , while maintaining privacy . <h> Please explain the difference between inside and outside mount . <p> A <p> Simply stated , these terms refer to whether you will be installing your window coverings inside or outside the window opening . Inside mount means the blind or shade will be installed within the recessed area of your window opening . Outside mount means the blinds or shades will be installed on the wall surface outside the window opening , either above or to the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surrounds the perimeter of the window opening or on a door ( again , above or to the side ) . <p> Outside mount blinds are usually used in windows that do n't  have enough depth to mount the blinds/shades or when you are trying to get better light control by covering the entire window . We recommend that you add 3 " to the height and width to allow room to install the brackets ( minimum required space is listed in the specification section of each product ) and give better light coverage . <h> What is the continuous loop lift cord option offered on different types of shades ? <p> A <p> A continuous loop lift cord option means the lift cord of the shades is a continuous loop operated by a clutch assembly to make lifting and lowering the shade smooth and easy .

Use the smallest of these 3 measurements to order you blinds or shades . Measure the height on the far left , middle , and far right of the window and use largest height measurement when placing your order . <p> For outside mount : Measure the full width of the area you want to cover with the blind or shade shade and , if space permits , add an extra 3 " to each side to eliminate light leakage . Measure the full height of the area you wish to cover with the shade and add 1 + " to 2 " to encompass the flat mounting surface area .

When installed correctly , blackout shades can reduce up to 99% of light from entering a room . <h> How do you buy blinds or shades for windows ? <p> A <p> Buying window blinds or shades is a relatively simple process that requires making a few important decisions , such as : <p> Do you prefer blinds or shades ? <p> Blinds and shades are both effective window coverings with their own pros and cons .

Shades also raise and lower easier than blinds . <p> Inside installations are the most common method for hanging blinds . These installations involve mounting the headrail flush within the top of the window frame and the entire blind being contained within the window casing . <p> Outside installations involve mounting the headrail completely outside of the window frame on the wall , molding , or even the ceiling . This method is generally used when the window frame is too shallow for an inside mount or you wish to cover unattractive woodwork or molding around your window . <p> What type of blinds do you like ? <p> Blindster offers a variety of blinds to fit every home , room , and window : <p> Fauxwood blinds <p> Faux wood blinds provide the same elegant beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain .

Use a microfiber cloth ( or vacuum with brush attachment at the lowest suction setting ) and get as much dust off your blinds as possible 2 . Work top to bottom on horizontal blinds 3 . Go from left to right with vertical blinds 4 . Many blinds are not hung properly , so be ready for them to fall out of their brackets halfway through your cleaning process 5 . To wash , add 3 drops of dish detergent to a bucket of warm water 6 . Dunk your microfiber cloth in the bucket , and wring it out until it 's just slightly damp 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baking soda to your bucket of dish detergent and water 8 . You can also try to grab the middle of the slat , clean to the end , come back in to the middle , and clean out the other end <h> Fabric Blinds <p> 1 . Prevention helps a ton " vacuum them regularly with your brush attachment at the lowest setting ( this also helps prevent discoloration ) 2 . Like you did with non-fabric blinds , vacuum them with a brush first or wipe them down with a microfiber cloth dipped in warm water with dish detergent 3 . Place your sponge in a mixture of 3 drops dish detergent/water and lightly wipe the stained areas of your fabric blinds ( test this mixture out in a hidden area first if you 're worried about damaging your blinds ) 4 . Follow that up with a towel to soak up as much moisture as possible <h> Wooden/Faux Wood Blinds <p> 1 . Treat these like you would furniture ! 2 . Lower the blind fully and tilt the slats so they are almost closed 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverse the slats and repeat 5 . Open the slats and let them dry <h> Roman Shades <p> 1 . Vacuum them weekly with your brush attachment as a preventative measure ( up to 3 times weekly if you live in a dry , dusty climate ) 2 . Do not vacuum them if they have decorative stitching , as this loosens that stitching 3 . Spray fabric shades with a fabric freshener every week and rinse clean with water 4 . For deep cleaning or stain removal ( ideally done immediately ) , try upholstery cleaner or carpet cleaning foam ( make sure you try this on a hidden area of these shades first ) 5 . You can also wash Roman shades in your washing machine . Make sure you disassemble them properly , coiling each cord and tying up the coils with twist ties . For flat Roman shades , pull out all dowels . Use a mild detergent and cool water on a gentle cycle for 15 minutes . Dry your shades in the dryer for 30 minutes , removing them when they are nearly dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up . 6 . Use a fabric protectant after cleaning to keep them clean <h> Keeping Your Shades Clean Is n't Easy <p> But now you at least know the process . And remember , if it 's too much work , you can always hire a professional to do it instead . 
@@58519750 @7519750/ <p> Getting the right window treatments for your home can make a huge difference in its appearance and comfort level . Window treatments are extremely versatile and can make windows appear larger , hide unattractive window casings , add a touch of elegance to an otherwise bland room , block out 100 percent of sunlight , allow ample filtered sunlight into your home , and even lower your electricity bills . <p> While there 's no mistaking the beauty , usefulness , and overall utility of window coverings , it 's important to take the right steps when you 're preparing your home for them , purchasing them , installing them , and caring for them . That said , getting new blinds and shades on your windows and keeping them looking great for years to come is a very simple process , but it does require some diligence to get the perfect look and fit for your home . <p> At Blindster , we see firsthand many common mistakes that some homeowners make with their window treatments , and we hope this list of Dos and Don'ts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place your order without taking precise measurements . <p> For most people , the primary purpose of ordering window treatments is to be able to control the lighting and increase the privacy in their homes . Unfortunately , blinds and shades that do n't fit properly are less effective at both . Before you place your order , make sure you take precise measurements of the interior of your window or the area outside your window where you want to install your new window treatments . If you 're not sure how to take these measurements , consult our measuring instructions section , which contains step-by-step processes for getting accurate measurements for all our products . <h> Do make sure you have everything you need to install your new window treatments . <p> Installing new blinds and shades is a DIY job that almost anyone can accomplish " especially when they 're going on standard-sized windows and doors . But to make the process as quick and easy as possible , it 's important to make sure that you 're properly equipped for the job . A step ladder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time to install your window coverings , as you 'll need to reach the top of your window casing or the area that 's around one-foot above it if you opted for an outside installation . In addition , you 'll need a screwdriver , drill , drill bits , pencil , level , and all included installation materials , including brackets and cord cleats . Set all your tools out before you begin installing to keep them handy throughout the process . <h> Do n't be afraid to ask for help . <p> DIY is n't for everyone , and in some cases , it can be difficult to install certain window treatments by yourself . Large window treatments that were custom cut to fit oversized windows may be too heavy and too tall or wide for one person to install , regardless of their DIY experience level . If you need help installing your new blinds and shades , do n't hesitate to call a friend , family member , neighbor , or even a contractor to assist you . Many homeowners use professionals to install window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Do make safety your top priority . <p> If you purchased window treatments with cords , whether they 're nylon cords or chain cords , it 's important to understand that they can pose strangulation risks for young children and animals . At Blindster , we include free cord cleats with all corded window treatment purchases . Make sure you install the cord cleat at the same time as your new blinds and shades , and make sure the cords are always safely secured on these devices . For even greater safety and peace of mind , move furniture away from windows that allows easy access to window treatments , including tables and chairs . <h> Do n't liquid clean without spot testing first . <p> In most cases , blinds and shades do n't need cleaning beyond regular dusting , vacuuming , and occasional wipe downs with a damp rag or paper towel . But spills or heavy accumulation of dirt and dust may necessitate more intensive cleaning .

For many homeowners , the living room is the first place they 'll begin when they 're overhauling their homes ' window treatments . If you started out with just one room and you 're happy with the results of your new blinds or shades , consider moving on to other rooms in your home . Getting the right window treatments can make a huge difference for bedrooms , nurseries , home offices , game rooms , and even bathrooms . 
@@58519752 @7519752/ <p> How should you mount your window blinds ? Should they be on the inside of your window 's casing , or outside of it ? <p> That decision is up to you . <p> For now , we 'll give you some tips so you know the pros and cons of each . <h> Why Mount Your Blinds Inside the Window Frame ? <p> When you do this , your blinds are recessed and contained inside of the window 's casing . It 's the most popular way of mounting blinds . <p> That 's because when you mount your blinds this way , your windows get a clean , finished look . And if you have molding running around the edges or window casing that you just have to show off , inside mount blinds make that possible . <p> Inside mount blinds also make sense if you do n't want your blinds to catch on your drapes . <p> Their one drawback is you ca n't use them if : <p> The depth between the glass and the end of the window casing is less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depth the blinds and valance may extend outside the window opening they are open . <p> Obstructions like window cranks and alarm sensors make it impossible to install and use them <p> If you are the one installing them , make sure- you order using the window opening width ( smallest of the width measurements at the top , middle and bottom of the window ) . - The factory will take a width deduction ( varies by product ) so that the blinds will fit inside the window and move freely. - - There may be- a smidgeon of light- showing on each side of the blind . <h> Why Use Outside Mount Window Blinds ? <p> These window blinds are generally less popular than inside mount blinds . You install them by fastening them either to your window 's upper molding , the wall just above it , the ceiling- or out to the side of the window <p> Outside mount window blinds may make sense for you because : <p> You have an ugly window casing , molding , or glass you want to hide ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your window casing is either too shallow or has obstructions in the way of installing inside mount blinds <p> You have doors you want to cover " they almost never have enough space for inside mount blinds <p> You like doing everything in a unique way <p> Because they are not protected by the window casing , one of the downfalls of outside mount window blinds is they can be damaged easier . <h> A Word of Warning ! <p> With outside mount blinds , you have a greater margin for measurement error because there 's more room to mount them . We usually recommend that you add either 3 inches to the height of your window opening or 2 inches to the width ( or both ) to completely cover the window opening. - However , you need to make sure you have a flat space large enough to install the brackets ( size varies by product ranting from 1 inch to 3 inches ) . <p> You still need to have accurate measurements with both types of blinds . However , - width measurements are more critical with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the windows frame . <p> You should always aim to be very precise with your measurements because the more precise you are , the more light your blinds block out . Be sure to use a metal tape measure. - If you 're uncomfortable taking measurements on your own , you can always have a professional help you . <p> Anyway , hopefully that sheds some light on the issue of inside and outside mount blinds ! <p> You can find exactly what you want online or communicate it to a store associate at Blindster.com. 
@@58519754 @7519754/ <p> The truth is that these shades offer very similar benefits , but they each go about it in their own way . There 's some benefits and drawbacks to each style . <p> Here 's the low-down : <h> 1 . Solar Shades <p> When most people use this term , they refer to shades inside their home that block UV rays . They work particularly well in colder climates , as they wo n't be harassed by the snowy , windy weather . During the summer , they keep the sun out and your cooling bills down . In the winter , you raise them up , let the sun in , and get lower heating bills . <p> Interior solar shades , like their exterior counterparts , also do an excellent job of reducing the sun 's glare . <h> 2 . Exterior Solar Shades <p> These shades attach to the exterior of your home just like a custom awning . Exterior solar shades work best in climates where it 's warm year round . <p> They do an awesome job of protecting your privacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for passers-by to see in . <p> They even block the sun from ever entering your house , making them good for keeping your cooling bills low . Speaking in numbers , they reduce the sun 's heating of your home by about 80% . Interior solar shades have a 30-70% effectiveness . <p> Smart manufacturers use Velcro to secure the bottom of these shades so they do n't blow along with the wind and get damaged . High-quality , durable PVC and polyester yarns should also be used . <h> A Word of Caution ! <p> You have to be somewhat careful because some blinds manufacturers will use interior materials on exterior solar shades . Guess what ? They wear out much faster than they should , and you end up paying more in the long run . <p> Always ask the manufacturer about the materials they use to make your exterior solar shades . <h> So That 's What These Shades are All About <p> And here 's a few odds and ends on both . Exterior solar shades generally work best on patios , decks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block more UV rays , while darker colors make it easier for you to see outside . <p> And one thing you 'll want to know as you browse both kinds is their openness factor . The lower this number , the better the shade blocks UV rays and protects your privacy . The higher it is , the easier for you to see outside . <p> An openness factor of 5% has high UV blockage and low visibility . You can find much higher percentages like 10% , or even 20% or more that give you better visibility .

Dead leaves , snow , ice , freezing rain , and cold winds can all leave a mark on your home , and the winter sludge that builds up from November through February can become particularly unsightly once the weather warms . <p> To get your home looking its best before spring , take the time to clean out any dead leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rain showers are a sure bet during April and May , and clogged gutters can cause soil erosion and even damage to your roof due to the accumulation of heavy rainfall . <p> Finally , consider pressure washing the exterior of your home to blast away any unsightly stains caused by exposure to winter weather .

To get a head start on the warm weather headed your way , make sure you replace all air filters in your home 's HVAC unit . <p> If you 've had any issues with your HVAC over the winter or during the previous summer , it 's a good idea to have a repairman visit and inspect your unit for any problems .

But that equipment does n't do any good unless its tested on a regular basis . While you 're taking the time to prepare your home for spring weather , it 's also a good time to prepare your home for the possibility of disaster . <p> Test all smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home and replace any batteries that are running low .

While you may have access to all the tools necessary to cut down a tree or limb , it 's important to remember that you 're dealing with something that 's extremely heavy and unpredictable . In addition to putting yourself and your own home at risk , you could also do major damage to your neighbor 's homes as well . <h> Renovating an existing or installing a new bathroom <p> Bathrooms are huge selling points for homes .

The average home has enough power running through its wires at any given time to seriously injure or even kill a person who touches it . In addition , faulty wiring can lead to power spikes , lost power , and even fires " especially if it 's near highly flammable things like insulation , drywall , and other materials .

They also may leak with individual shingles peeling away from the roof or even falling off it . If your roof needs a repair , renovation , or complete re-do , you may be tempted to climb up there and begin taking care of business yourself . However , working on a roof is n't just hard " it 's also dangerous . One-third of construction fatalities are due to workers falling off roofs , and homeowners do n't fare much better , particularly when they do n't have any experience working on a roof .

@@58519892 @7519892/ <p> Once considered the realm of the niche and perhaps the crazy , tiny houses are quickly becoming hot commodities and are increasing in sales every year . If you 're unfamiliar with the term , tiny houses are around 100-400 square feet in total size " which is significantly smaller than the average American home size of 2,600 square feet . Tiny houses generally feature one bedroom , a small dining and living area , and a very small kitchen and bathroom . In fact , most tiny houses could fit several times over in the average home 's living room or garage . <p> What 's the appeal of tiny houses ? Supporters say that they 're much more affordable , economically sound , and encourage a lifestyle that moves away from consumerism . However , they 're not without some serious drawbacks . Here are some of the top pros and cons for living in a tiny house : <p> PRO <p> Pro : They 're cheap . <p> Tiny houses are cheap in several ways . First , they 're cheap to purchase outright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built for significantly less if they 're built by hand . In addition , tiny houses are much cheaper to furnish , heat in the winter and cool in the summer , and the required land to build a tiny house is small . All in all , the costs of building and living in a tiny house are significantly less than the costs of living in a traditional multi-bedroom home . <p> CON <p> Con : They 're tiny . <p> This con may seem obvious considering their name , but tiny houses are just that " tiny . Living in such a small space takes getting used to , and some people will never be able to adapt to living in close quarters with significant others or pets . In addition to the lack of room to move around , tiny houses also have very little storage space , which means owners must get creative with their furniture and be extremely cautious about bringing anything new into the home to avoid running out of room or becoming overrun with even a small amount of possessions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A positive trade-off of the lack of space means that tiny houses are incredibly easy to keep clean . While deep-cleaning a traditional family home takes hours or even days , cleaning a tiny house from top to bottom can be done in an hour or less . The ease of cleaning a tiny house does n't end with cleaning the living space , either . Tiny house owners also benefit from being able to clean the outside of their homes in no time . Problems like mildew , chipped paint , stained ceiling tiles , and other unsightly issues that are common with larger homes can be cleaned off or repaired in a snap on a tiny house . <p> CON <p> Con : They lack privacy . <p> Unless a tiny house is built in a secluded area , it 's hard to feel a true sense of privacy while living in such small quarters . While traditional home owners can escape inside their homes and feel protected and separated from the outside world , tiny home dwellers may feel vulnerable and barely protected from nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private area of a home , such as a large bathroom or quiet bedroom , can be difficult for some home owners to accept when they make the transition to a tiny house . <p> PRO <p> Pro : They encourage an active lifestyle . <p> While tiny houses can certainly be built and furnished to encourage comfort , their size means that many people will feel compelled to get out of the house more often . Modern homes make many people creatures of habit and comfort , and coming from home from work to watch television is a reality of life for many people . But because tiny houses are designed primarily for efficiency and savings over comfort , they 're perfect for people who would rather spend their leisure time outdoors or in public spaces . <p> CON <p> Con : They 're vulnerable in severe weather . <p> Whether it 's flooding , tornadoes , hurricanes , blizzards , or even just strong winds , tiny houses are much more vulnerable to the elements than standard homes . While there are precautions and proactive steps tiny home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more able to withstand severe weather , they 're still not ideal places to live when the sky turns dark and menacing . To better protect themselves in the event of severe weather , some tiny home owners invest in storm shelters to have safe places where they can wait out storms and other inclement weather . <p> PRO <p> Pro : They 're eco-friendly . <p> Tiny houses require much less energy to build , maintain , power , and air condition . They also use fewer construction materials , which means they make a much smaller initial impact on the environment . Some tiny houses can even be powered almost exclusively by solar energy , meaning their carbon footprint after construction is almost zero . Another positive to owning a tiny house is that the extra land that normally would be taken up by the home itself can be repurposed for other purposes , such as raising livestock or growing a garden to produce fresh food on a year-round basis . <p> CON <p> Con : They use small appliances . <p> Due to the lack of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as full-size appliances , are considered luxuries for tiny home owners . Instead of having a large double-door refrigerator , tiny home owners often must settle for apartment-sized or even mini refrigerators to cool and freeze their foods . And because the refrigerators are so small , it can limit the amount of food they can store at any given time , meaning more frequent trips to the grocery store . Automatic dishwashers are often excluded from tiny homes , and washer and dryers for clothes are often excluded or small in size as well . <p> As you can see , owning and living in a tiny home is n't for everyone.While there are certainly some very appealing aspects to simplifying your lifestyle to the point where you can live and thrive in a house under 400 square feet , the drawbacks can be significant . In the end , it 's up to each person to decide if a tiny house is right for them . <h> Like this : <p> LikeLoading ... <h> Share this entry <p> LONG ... 19:45:172015-02-25 19:45:17Pros and Cons of Owning a Tiny House

Over time , the savings you net can be significant and can go back into improving your home , saving for the future , or used to finance vacations and other leisure activities . <h> Your monthly mortgage payments do n't increase like rent . <p> Buying a home generally locks you into a fixed-rate mortgage , which are pre-determined payments due every month until the house is paid off . The stability and consistency of these payments can help you budget years into the future , as you 'll always know roughly how much money you need to set aside . But as a renter , your monthly expenses are subject to things like inflation , gentrification , and housing shortages in your city " all of which can significantly raise your rental payments year after year . <h> Your home accumulates value over time . <p> Living in an area that experiences rapid growth and development is often a bad thing for renters , as their rental homes or apartments may see huge increases in rent or may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a homeowner , any positive change in your neighborhood is also a positive change for the value of your home . Even if your neighborhood remains steady over the next several decades , its value will still go up over time as long as you maintain it . <h> You get increased privacy . <p> Apartments and townhouses are poor choices for anyone who truly values their privacy and peace and quiet . Not only do you share parking lots , parking spaces , and common areas with your neighbors , but you also share walls " and depending on the thickness of those walls , you may be able to hear just about everything that 's happening on the other side . Owning a home means you have the freedom to use your own lawn without intruding on your neighbors ' space , and not sharing walls with anyone else means you can play music , invite guests over , or remodel a room at 2 a.m. guilt-free . <h> It encourages you to get involved in your community . <p> When you 're renting , you may feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you move often . But when you own a home , you 're literally investing in your own city and community . Putting down roots in an area means you have more time to get to know your neighbors and more time to truly understand local issues . It 's no surprise that homeowners are far more likely to be involved in community civics meetings and to vote on issues that affect their neighborhoods . <h> You will eventually pay it off . <p> Even though it may seem like it will never happen " especially if you just signed a brand new 25 or 30-year mortgage " eventually there will come a day when your home is paid off . Not only does paying off your home give you and your family a tremendous sense of security that you simply ca n't get as a renter , but it also allows you to begin saving money that went toward what was likely your biggest expense for more than a third of your life . There 's also the psychological benefit of knowing that each time you write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will eventually own . <h> It 's an automatic savings account . <p> Whether you 're a spend thrift who saves every penny or someone who believes money is meant to be enjoyed , owning a home means at least a portion of your income is going toward something tangible and lasting every month . As you pay off more and more of your home , your equity increases along with your home 's value . That means you always have a source of emergency income should you need it in the form of equity loans or even selling your home outright . <h> Your home can last for generations . <p> Owning a home is the ultimate family heirloom . Not only is it the place where you will raise your kids , but it can also be the place they come back to during college , as young adults , and with their own children in tow years from now . In addition , your home can also be passed on to your children or grandchildren after you 're gone .

@@58520009 @7520009/ <p> Spring is well underway , and that means it 's time to start paying close attention to your lawn . While the best time to reseed your lawn is in the fall , there are many steps you can take right now to both get your lawn looking great and prepping it for an overhaul later in the year . <p> To get a head start on your perfect summer lawn and the fall seeding season , check out Blindster 's spring lawn care guide . <h> Know your grass type <p> Before you begin working in your lawn , it 's important to know what type of grass you have . <p> Cool-season grasses- typically have a moderate growth spurt in the spring and then go dormant during the hot summer months before having another big growth spurt in the fall . Common cool-season grasses include fescue , bluegrass , and rye . The goal for these types of grass during the spring is to make it as healthy as possible during its summer dormancy . <p> Warm-season grasses- do well during the heat of the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which include Bermudagrass , St. Augustine , and centipede , begin slowly growing after the last frost of early spring and their growth gets kicked into high gear by midsummer when the temperatures are at their hottest . The goal for this type of grass is to make sure it reaches its full potential during the warm summer months and is primed for reseeding during the fall . <h> Go easy on the grass <p> Spring is a vulnerable time for your lawn . As your grass awakens from its winter dormancy , it 's very fragile and can be damaged by hard raking and even foot traffic . Excess damage can even result in bald patches on your lawn as summer approaches . <p> However , early spring is still an excellent time to clean up any debris left over from the winter . Remove any fallen limbs to encourage grass growth in your yard and gently rake up any dead and excess leaves . If you have any leftover snow piles , spread them out evenly with a shovel to encourage faster melting . Large accumulations of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early spring . <h> Get serious about controlling weeds <p> While fall is the best time to reseed your lawn , spring is the best time to kill and prevent new weeds from growing . During early spring , many weeds have yet to emerge from the ground " making their roots highly susceptible to treatments . <p> All grass types benefit from preventative weed control , but be aware that an application in March or April should be followed up with another application in June or July , as most pre-emergency weed herbicides only last for around three months . <h> Fertilize your lawn depending on the grass type <p> The type of grass in your lawn not only determines its growth rates and dates , but also dictates when and how much fertilizer you should use to maximize its growth and thickness . <p> Cool-season grasses should be fertilized lightly in the early spring if the lawn is in bad shape . Over-fertilizing cool-season grasses can provide a quick boost in the spring , but leaves them vulnerable to the elements during the summer . For best results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help and save the rest of the work for the fall . <p> Warm-season grasses take much better to springtime work and should be fertilized as soon as your lawn begins to mature , thicken , and grow quickly and evenly . For most climates , this occurs in late April or early May . <h> Check your soil <p> If you 've noticed that your grass is n't growing the way you want it to or it tends to die without a reasonable explanation , you soil may be the culprit . Spring is the perfect time to test your soil and find out if it 's starving your grass of oxygen and nutrients . Acidic soil with a pH level below 6 can be treated at any point during the growing season with an application of lime " and the earlier in spring you apply it , the better the results will be . <h> Water your grass regularly <p> If you live in an area that does n't get much rainfall , it 's important to make sure that your grass gets plenty of water during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once per week throughout the spring and summer to give it a good growth foundation . You can begin to taper off on regular watering once the fall arrives and the weather turns cooler . <h> Get insects and pests under control <p> Weeds are n't the only thing that can harm your grass . Insects and small pests can also do a number on your lawn if not controlled quickly . Use the early spring growing season to inspect your lawn for any signs of infestation or rodent activity and take the proper measures to eliminate these pests from your lawn using the appropriate chemicals or traps . <h> Inspect and prepare your lawn care equipment <p> Once your lawn begins growing in the spring , you should be prepared to start cutting it at least twice a week to maintain a uniform appearance . That 's why it 's important to get a head start on the spring lawn care season by making sure your lawn care equipment is fully prepped and ready to go . Check your lawn mower for any possible grass clogs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be sharpened . You should also start it up before you need to mow to make sure it runs smoothly and easily . <p> Other equipment like weed eaters , aerators , and leaf blowers should also be inspected and tested before your first day working on the lawn during the spring . <h> Prepare a strategy for mowing your lawn <p> While mowing a lawn simply requires running a moving blade over it , mowing a lawn properly requires a bit more foresight and planning . To keep your lawn looking its best and remaining at peak health , always mow each strip of grass in opposite directions . That means if you start out mowing the edge of your yard north to south , change it up and go east to west the next time . <p> You should also mow your lawn in back and forth patterns to create a consistent and appealing look rather than mowing in a spiral . To mow around an obstacle like a tree or flower bed , mow around it twice and go the opposite direction on the second pass .

Here are 10 ways to save on your next electricity bill that wo n't break the bank . <h> Plant trees in your yard and shrubs near windows . <p> Even small trees can make a big difference in your home 's energy bills by providing shade and limiting the amount of direct sunlight that passes through your windows .

As long as a device is plugged into the wall , it draws power . That 's why it 's important to unplug any devices that are n't in use , including things like televisions , video game consoles , DVRs , computers , and cell phone chargers . To make it easy , plug your gadgets into a surge protector and unplug the entire strip from the wall when you leave your home for an extended period of time or go to bed at night to save energy . <h> Do n't pre-rinse your dishes . <p> If you have a modern dishwasher , it 's unnecessary to pre-wash or pre-rinse your dishes .

While replacing one bulb in your home may not make a big difference , replacing every bulb can make a big difference in your energy bill in the years to come . <h> Install solar panels . <p> Although more expensive than many of the tips in the list , installing solar panels is a highly efficient way to not only improve your home 's energy efficiency , but it will also reduce your home 's dependence on traditional electricity provided by the power company .

If you 're not satisfied with the way your home looks when you pull in your driveway every day , or if you 're looking for ways to maximize its resale value , read these 10 tips from Blindster to boost your home 's curb appeal and make it the showpiece of your neighborhood . <h> Focus on the front door . <p> Your front door says a lot about your home .

If you 're happy with the door you have but feel like it 's lacking something , consider painting it a bold color like schoolhouse red , royal blue , or even canary yellow . <h> Paint the exterior . <p> Much like your front door can breathe new life into an old or visually unappealing exterior , taking it one step further and painting your entire home can often lead to a dramatic improvement in its overall appearance . A fresh coat of paint makes older homes look new and hides most types of damage caused by sunlight , wind , rain , hail , and other weathering caused by years of exposure to the elements . <h> Pressure wash everything . <p> If you do n't have the time to paint your home , consider giving it a good bath with a pressure washer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wood , brick , stone , vinyl , and virtually any other material that might be found on the exterior of your home .

Because of their size , garage doors can often dominate the focal point of homes " and if they do n't match the rest of the home in terms of color or design , it can detract from the home 's overall appearance .

Not only do these help your guests find their way at night , but they also improve the looks of your home after dark . <h> Replace your mailbox . <p> Your mailbox may seem like the last thing that would have an impact on your home 's curb appeal , but it can actually play a huge role in the perception and value of your home . Having a cheap plastic mailbox is great if you have a student driver in your household , but it 's not much of an asset when it comes to adding value to your home .

If your lawn has seen better days but you do n't have the time to keep it looking pristine , fill in any trouble spots with flowers , shrubs , and other plants . Not only do these require much less upkeep than grass , but they also add color and variety to your lawn . <h> Clean or replace your windows . <p> Depending on the age of your home and its windows , you may be able to get by with just giving them a good cleaning .

In many cases , buying a house that needs a lot of work and a big investment can pay off in a short time " but all buyers , no matter how experienced they are , take a big risk when they sign on the dotted line . <p> If you 're thinking about purchasing a fixer-upper either to live in or to renovate it and put it on the market , read these warning signs and make sure the house you 're eyeing is free from any major defects before you take the plunge . <h> Hazardous materials and building supplies <p> Many older homes contain both asbestos and lead paint , which are known to have the potential to cause serious health problems in people who are exposed to those substances . Removing these substances " particularly asbestos " can be very expensive and time-consuming and requires the services of qualified professionals . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are within your budget if the home is known to have hazardous materials in its structure . <h> Water damage <p> Water damage in homes can range in severity for minor pipe leaks to full-blown flooded basements or bathrooms . Use your best judgment when purchasing a home with water damage , but note that flooded basements can require expensive renovations and may be susceptible to more flood damage in the future . In addition , you should also consider having wood frames and floorboards throughout the home inspected if the flood damage occurred on the main floor or second floor , as the water damage can cause the wood to rot and become a potentially dangerous hazard . <h> Structural problems <p> A house with structural problems is a house you should probably avoid " unless you 're willing to shell out major money to fix it . Structural issues mean a house is literally on its way toward completely collapsing or falling over , making it both extremely dangerous and a candidate for condemnation . In addition , unless you get an absolute steal on the asking price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into fixing a home 's foundation and structure . Common signs of structural problems including cracks in the brick exterior and parts of the home that are n't level , especially in the corners . <h> Roof damage <p> Repairing and replacing a roof is pretty standard for most fixer-upper homes , but before you dive in , it 's important to check just how damaged the roof actually is . If the damage is limited to the shingles or tiles , it should n't be an issue to replace them all with newer materials that are better designed to withstand the elements . However , if the damage goes beyond the roof itself and has entered the attic , insulation , and walls , the problem cost of fixing it may increase significantly . <h> Electrical issues <p> Neither you nor your potential buyers will be interested in living in a home without reliable electricity and power in every room and every outlet . Unfortunately , older homes and homes in dire need of repair often have outdated and even broken electrical systems and wiring . Before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what type of work needs to be done . If the wiring is several decades old , it may need to be completely replaced , but homes with newer installations may only need repairs in certain rooms or on certain outlets . <h> Heating and central air <p> Unless the home you 're looking at is located in a perfect climate where the weather is never hot or cold , you need reliable air conditioning . Like wiring issues , older homes often have significant issues with their HVAC , furnace , or central air units " and replacing those is n't cheap . Before singing on the dotted line , do your best to find out the exact age of the unit and whether it 's feasible to apply a quick fix to any issues or whether you need to install a brand new system . <h> Unattractive lawn and landscaping <p> Whipping a lawn into shape can range from a simple weekend project to something that takes weeks or longer " especially if you want to add an outdoor entertaining area . One major factor to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a tendency to flood or if there any harmful/toxic chemicals that get into the soil due to runoff . A beaten-down lawn with otherwise healthy soil and no major issues lurking underneath the bare patches should n't dissuade you from making an investment , but a lawn that needs to be completely dug up just to get to the root of the issues should be a big red flag . <h> Outdated or drafty doors and windows <p> No matter how many coats of paint you put on a home 's exterior , it still wo n't live up to its curbside potential if the doors and windows are cracked , fogged , warped , or just plain unappealing . Replacing all outside doors and windows is a major budgetary concern for fixer-upper homes , as you may be able to hold off on replacing certain smaller or less prominent windows , such as those in bathrooms or those on the back side of the home . However , the upfront cost of replacing aging doors and windows with more energy-efficient models can be a big selling point for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money down the road . <h> Major renovation costs <p> Some homes are built using floor-plans that simply are n't in demand in 2015 . Long , narrow hallways , confined spaces , sectioned-off kitchens , and cramped bathrooms are all relics of a home design era from decades ago , but they 're common in many fixer-upper homes . In many cases , it can be difficult to sell a fixer-upper no matter how much work you put into it if the floorplan is simply unappealing to buyers . Always factor in the cost of completely renovating the interior of the home . Knocking down walls , expanding bedrooms and bathrooms , renovating the kitchen , and converting an unused bedroom into an office or man cave can quickly add a major bullet point to the home 's appeal , but you should always make sure you 'll be in good shape to recoup the cost once the work is finished .

Getting too attached to one property means you 'll be more likely to overlook its flaws and problem areas that might be considered deal breakers with other homes .
